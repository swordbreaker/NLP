G;|Kasimir Sewerinowitsch Malewitsch (russisch Казимир Северинович Малевич, wiss. Transliteration Kazimir Severinovič Malevič, polnisch Kazimierz Malewicz; * 11. Februarjul./ 23. Februar 1878greg. in Kiew; † 15. Mai 1935 in Leningrad) war Maler und Hauptvertreter der Russischen Avantgarde, Wegbereiter des Konstruktivismus und Begründer des Suprematismus. Beeinflusst wurde er von den französischen Spätimpressionisten, Fauves und Kubisten. Sein abstraktes suprematistisches Gemälde Das Schwarze Quadrat auf weißem Grund aus dem Jahr 1915 gilt als ein Meilenstein der Malerei der Moderne und wird als „Ikone der Moderne“ bezeichnet.  Kindheit und Jugend Der Vater Seweryn Malewicz (russ. Sewerin Antonowitsch Malewitsch, 1845–1902) und seine Mutter Ludwika (russ. Ljudwiga Alexandrowna, 1858–1942) waren Polen, die nach dem Januaraufstand von 1863, der von den russischen Truppen niedergeschlagen worden war, in die Ukraine kamen. In der Familie wurde neben Polnisch auch Ukrainisch und Russisch gesprochen. Der Vater war vermutlich technischer Angestellter in verschiedenen Fabriken der Zuckerrübenindustrie; und da dieser öfter die Arbeitsstelle wechselte, verlebte Malewitsch in kärglichen Verhältnissen eine unstete Kindheit, in der er nur eine rudimentäre schulische Ausbildung erhielt. Es folgte eine fünfjährige Ausbildung an einer Landwirtschaftsschule. Mit etwa 13 Jahren erwachte Malewitschs Interesse am Zeichnen nach der Natur. Drei Jahre später inspirierte ihn ein „Anstreicher, der das Dach anstrich und ein Grün mischte wie die Bäume, wie der Himmel. Das brachte mich auf die Idee, man könne mit dieser Farbe Baum und Himmel wiedergeben. […] Der Bleistift aber ärgerte mich sehr, und ich warf ihn schließlich weg, um zum Pinsel zu greifen.“ Ausbildung Die Familie zog im Jahr 1896 nach Kursk um, wo der Vater eine Stellung in der Verwaltung der Eisenbahngesellschaft Kursk–Moskau annahm und seinem Sohn eine Stellung als technischer Zeichner vermittelte. Malewitsch fand dort gleichgesinnte Autodidakten, die ausschließlich nach der Natur malten und denen er sich anschloss. 1901 heiratete er die Polin Kazimiera Sgleitz. Sein Vater vereitelte alle seine Versuche, sich an der Kunstakademie in Moskau zu bewerben, doch im Herbst 1904 hatte Malewitsch genügend Geld gespart, um bis 1905 ein Studium an der Schule für Malerei, Skulptur und Architektur in Moskau absolvieren zu können. Ein Initialerlebnis bedeutete für Malewitsch im Jahr 1904 der Anblick von Claude Monets Gemälde der Kathedrale von Rouen, das sich in der Sammlung des Kunstmäzens Sergei Schtschukin in Moskau befand. „Zum ersten Mal sah ich die lichterfüllten Reflexionen des blauen Himmels, die reinen, transparenten Farbtöne. […] Von diesem Moment an wurde ich Impressionist.“ Von 1905 bis 1910 setzte er seine Ausbildung mit einem Studium am privaten Atelier von Fjodor Rerberg in Moskau fort. Künstlerischer Anfang 1907 siedelte Malewitschs Familie endgültig nach Moskau über, und im gleichen Jahr fand seine erste öffentliche Ausstellung von zwölf Skizzen im Rahmen der 14. Ausstellung des Verbandes der Moskauer Künstler statt neben ebenfalls noch weitgehend unbekannten Künstlern wie Wassily Kandinsky, Michail Fjodorowitsch Larionow, Natalija Sergejewna Gontscharowa. Im Jahr 1909 heiratete Malewitsch in zweiter Ehe Sofija Rafalowitsch, die Tochter eines Psychiaters. Im folgenden Jahr nahm er an der von Larionow und Gontscharowa veranstalteten Ausstellung der Künstlergruppe „Karo-Bube“ teil. Ab 1910 begann seine neoprimitivistische Periode, in der er beispielsweise die Dielenbohnerer malte, ein Gemälde mit deutlich reduzierter Raumperspektive. Gontscharowa und Larionow trennten sich 1912 von der ihnen verwestlicht erscheinenden Gruppe „Karo-Bube“ und begründeten die Künstlervereinigung „Eselsschwanz“ in Moskau, an der sich Malewitsch beteiligte. Auf einer Ausstellung dieser Vereinigung traf er auf den Maler und Komponisten Michail Wassiljewitsch Matjuschin. Die Bekanntschaft führte zu einer anregenden Zusammenarbeit, und es entwickelte sich zwischen beiden Künstlern eine lebenslange Freundschaft. Larionow war bisher Führer der Avantgarde gewesen, doch infolge des wachsenden Anspruchs Malewitschs entwickelte sich eine Rivalität um die Führungsrolle, die ihre Ursache auch in unterschiedlichen künstlerischen Konzepten hatte. Malewitsch wandte sich dem Kubofuturismus zu, den er in St. Petersburg bei der „Union der Jugend“ während eines Vortrags als einzig vertretbare Richtung in der Kunst darstellte. Er malte bis 1913 einige Bilder in diesem Stil, beispielsweise das Gemälde Der Holzfäller. Sein Werk war auch in Übersee in der Armory Show (International Exhibition of Modern Art) in New York im Jahr 1913 vertreten. Die Oper Sieg über die Sonne, Begründung des Suprematismus Im Sommer 1913 begannen unter Malewitschs Mitwirkung in Uusikirkko (Finnland) die Arbeiten an der Komposition der Oper Sieg über die Sonne. Das futuristische Werk wurde am 3. Dezember 1913 im Lunapark-Theater in Sankt Petersburg uraufgeführt. Welimir Chlebnikow verfasste den Prolog, Alexei Krutschonych das Libretto, die Musik stammte von Michail Matjuschin und das Bühnenbild sowie die Kostüme von Malewitsch. Auf einen Bühnenvorhang malte er das erste Schwarze Quadrat. Darin liegt auch der Grund, weshalb Malewitsch die Geburtsstunde des Suprematismus in das Jahr 1913 verlegte und sich nicht auf die im eigentlichen Sinne suprematistischen Bilder von 1915 berief. Im März/April 1914 fand im „Salon des Indépendants“ in Paris eine Ausstellung statt, auf der Malewitsch mit drei Gemälden vertreten war. Im Jahr 1915 schrieb er das Manifest Vom Kubismus zum Suprematismus. Der neue malerische Realismus – mit dem Schwarzen Quadrat auf dem Umschlag − und stellte im Dezember in der Ausstellung Letzte futuristische Ausstellung „0,10“ erstmals sein suprematistisches Gemälde Das Schwarze Quadrat auf weißem Grund in der Galerie Dobytschina in Petrograd (von 1914 bis 1924 der Name für Sankt Petersburg) aus, das im Katalog als Viereck bezeichnet wurde. Die geheimnisvolle Zahl 0,10 bezeichnet eine Denkfigur: Null, weil man erwartete, dass nach der Zerstörung des Alten die Welt von Null wieder beginnen könnte, und zehn, weil sich ursprünglich zehn Künstler beteiligen wollten. Tatsächlich waren es vierzehn Künstler, die an der Ausstellung teilgenommen hatten. Malewitsch hängte sein Quadrat schräg oben in die Wandecke unter die Decke des Raumes, dort hatte gewöhnlich eine russische Ikone ihren traditionellen Platz. Zu den Ausstellenden gehörten neben Malewitsch Wladimir Tatlin, Nadeschda Udalzowa, Ljubow Popowa und Iwan Puni. Die Ausstellung, die vernichtende Kritiken erhielt, markiert jedoch den Durchbruch zur gegenstandslosen, abstrakten Kunst; das bahnbrechende Ereignis in der Kunstgeschichte fand zu dieser Zeit nicht die länderübergreifende Beachtung, da in Europa der Krieg ausgebrochen war. Malewitsch wurde im Jahr 1916 zur zaristischen Armee einberufen und verbrachte die Zeit bis zum Kriegsende in einer Schreibstube. In dieser Zeit arbeitete er weiter an seinen Gemälden sowie an den theoretischen Schriften und korrespondierte mit Matjuschin. Obgleich die russischen Avantgardegruppen unterschiedliche Theorien vertraten, was zu Kontroversen führte, gab es unter den harten Kriegsbedingungen gemeinsame Kunstausstellungen der Suprematisten unter Malewitschs Führung sowie der Konstruktivisten, deren Leitung Tatlin innehatte. Malewitsch stellte beispielsweise auf Tatlins Wunsch in gewollter Abgrenzung ältere kubofuturistische Arbeiten zur Verfügung wie Ein Engländer in Moskau, die in dessen Ausstellung Magasin in einem Kaufhaus aufgenommen wurden. Nach der Oktoberrevolution 1917 wurde Malewitsch mit der Aufsicht über die nationalen Kunstsammlungen des Kreml betraut. So wurde er Vorsitzender der Kunstabteilung des Moskauer Stadtsowjets und Meister an der zweiten „Freien staatlichen Kunstwerkstätte“ (SWOMAS) sowie Professor an den „Freien staatlichen Kunstwerkstätten“ in Petrograd. Im engeren Sinn war er weder ein engagierter Funktionär noch Revolutionär, er nutzte nur die neuen Machthaber für die Durchsetzung seiner künstlerischen Ambitionen. Seine Malerei hatte sich in der Kunstszene durchgesetzt, er erhielt beispielsweise im Herbst 1918 mit Matjuschin den Auftrag, die Dekoration für einen Kongress über die Dorfarmut im Winterpalais zu schaffen.

Malewitsch gründete dort 1920 die Gruppe UNOWIS (Bestätiger der Neuen Kunst) und konnte nach kurzer Zeit viele Anhänger um sich scharen. Seine Tochter Una wurde geboren, ihr Name leitet sich von der Künstlergruppe ab. Chagall, der in den Auseinandersetzungen über die künstlerische Ausrichtung der Schule den Machtkampf gegen Malewitsch bereits 1921 verloren hatte, emigrierte 1922 über Berlin nach Paris. Der Architekt und Grafikdesigner El Lissitzky war ein Mitglied des Instituts; in seinem Atelier gestaltete er unter anderem auch Texte von Malewitsch wie Suprematismus 34 Zeichnungen (1920). In dieser historischen Periode wurde unter Malewitschs Leitung nicht nur die Schule selbst, das Unterrichtssystem, das Kulturleben der Stadt Witebsk verändert, sondern sie beeinflusste auch den weiteren Kunstprozess der Welt. Während Malewitschs Wirken in Witebsk (Witebsker Periode) waren die Ideen des Suprematismus theoretisch und konzeptionell vollendet. Sie benötigten ein neues Milieu für die Entwicklung und für den mehrfunktionalen Dialog des Erneuerungsverhaltens dem Leben gegenüber. Zu diesem Milieu ist Witebsk geworden, das man zu dieser Zeit das zweite Paris nannte. In Witebsk wurde die Idee zur Gründung eines Museums für Moderne Kunst von Marc Chagall geboren und verwirklicht. Heute wird diese Periode „Witebsker Renaissance“ oder „Witebsker Schule“ genannt. Lehrtätigkeit von 1922 bis 1926 Im April 1922, nach Streitigkeiten mit den Behörden, die die Russische Avantgarde bekämpften, verließen Malewitsch und ein größerer Teil seiner Studenten Witebsk in Richtung Petrograd (Sankt Petersburg). 1925 schloss er nach dem Tod seiner zweiten Frau die dritte Ehe mit Natalja Andrejewna Mantschenko. Von 1923 bis 1926 war Malewitsch Leiter des Instituts für künstlerische Kultur (INChUK, ab 1925 als Staatliches Institut GINChUK anerkannt) in Petrograd. Die regimekonforme Künstlergruppe AChRR beherrschte inzwischen jedoch die sowjetische Kunstkultur – die stalinistische Ära hatte begonnen und mit ihr die Ablehnung avantgardistischer Kunst – sodass Malewitsch in Ungnade fiel und 1926 seine Stellung verlor. Daher nahm er eine Beschäftigung am Staatlichen Institut für Kunstgeschichte an. Besuch in Berlin und Dessau Im Frühjahr 1927 erhielt Malewitsch ein Visum und reiste über Warschau nach Berlin, wo während der „Großen Berliner Kunstausstellung“ in der Galerie van Diemen 70 Gemälde und seine Architektona, Gipsmodelle seiner Architekturentwürfe, gezeigt wurden. In Dessau besuchte er das Bauhaus und konnte die Publikation seiner Schrift Die gegenstandslose Welt vereinbaren, die als elfter Band in der Reihe der Bauhausbücher (begründet von Walter Gropius und László Moholy-Nagy) veröffentlicht wurde, allerdings mit einem distanzierten Vorwort der Herausgeber. Im Gegensatz zu seinen Erwartungen wurde Malewitsch zwar als bedeutender Vertreter der russischen Avantgarde aufgenommen, doch dem Bauhaus lag zu diesem Zeitpunkt der russische Konstruktivismus näher als der Suprematismus, der in Deutschland mit seinem philosophischen System der Welterkenntnis als überholt erschien. In Dessau suchte man einen Weg zu einem gestalterischen Weltentwurf, ähnlich wie die niederländische Gruppe De Stijl, deren Mitbegründer Piet Mondrian wie Malewitsch ein früher Meister der Abstraktion war. Mondrians im Jahr 1920 geschaffene Stilrichtung Neoplastizismus war beeinflusst vom emotionalen Suprematismus Malewitschs. Im Juni kehrte Malewitsch nach Leningrad zurück; er hinterließ in Deutschland wegen der unsicheren politischen Verhältnisse in der Sowjetunion seine Schriften bei seinem Gastgeber Gustav von Riesen und die mitgebrachten Werke bei dem Architekten Hugo Häring, der sie für Malewitsch verwahrte. Zu dem geplanten erneuten Besuch Malewitschs kam es nicht mehr, sodass die Gemälde erst im Jahr 1951 wiederentdeckt und 1958 für rund 120.000 Mark vom Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam angekauft wurden. Durch einen Vergleich im Mai 2008 ist der jahrelange Streit zwischen den 37 Erben Malewitschs und der Stadt Amsterdam gütlich geregelt worden. Der jetzt erzielte Vergleich beschert den Erben fünf bedeutende Werke von Malewitsch. Im Gegenzug akzeptieren sie, dass die restlichen Bilder der Sammlung der Stadt Amsterdam bleiben, wo sie von 2009 an im wiedereröffneten Stedelijk Museum ausgestellt werden sollen. Rückkehr zur figurativen Malerei Malewitsch nahm seine Tätigkeit am Staatlichen Institut für Kunstgeschichte wieder auf, entwarf Pläne für Satellitenstädte in Moskau, beschäftigte sich mit Entwürfen für Porzellan und bemühte sich, seine Forschungsergebnisse zu veröffentlichen. Indem er seine dogmatischen Ansichten leicht zu revidieren suchte, war er auf der Suche nach neuen Möglichkeiten und Wegen für seine Kunst. Die wesentlichen Werke, die er in Deutschland zurückgelassen hatte, begann Malewitsch wiederherzustellen, indem er „verbesserte“ Repliken malte, das galt auch für impressionistische Motive. Er datierte die Arbeiten zurück, was später zu großer Verwirrung in Kunstkreisen führen sollte. Die Bilder dienten zur Vervollständigung seiner großen Werkschau, die im Jahr 1929 geplant war. Einen radikalen Umbruch ab Ende der 1920er Jahre in Malewitschs Werk stellte die Rückkehr zur figurativen Malerei mit suprematistischen Elementen dar; er stellte sie in den Dienst der geliebten Bauern, die unter der Kollektivierung der Landwirtschaft zu leiden hatten, was sich in seinem neuen Stil ausdrückte. In seiner Malweise wurden die Menschen nach und nach zu verstümmelten Puppen, zu Gefangenen eines verbrecherischen Gulag. Die weitere Arbeit am Staatlichen Institut für die Geschichte der Kunst wurde ihm 1929 untersagt und das Institut wenig später geschlossen. Zwei Wochen im Monat durfte er im Kunstinstitut in Kiew arbeiten. Im November des Jahres stellte er in der Tretjakow-Galerie in Moskau anlässlich einer Retrospektive seine Werke aus, erntete aber überwiegend negative Kritik. Kurz darauf wurde die Ausstellung nach Kiew übernommen, wurde aber nach wenigen Tagen bereits wieder geschlossen. Im Jahr 1930 wurde Malewitsch festgenommen und zwei Wochen lang zu Verhören vorgeführt. In seiner letzten künstlerischen Phase, kurz vor seinem Tod, kehrte er zur Malweise „realer“ Porträts zurück, diese entsprechen jedoch nicht dem Stil des „Sozialistischen Realismus“, sondern ähneln Werken der Renaissance, die sich in der Bekleidung der Porträtierten ausdrückt. Charakteristisch an diesen Gemälden sind die ausdrucksvollen Gesten der dargestellten Personen. 1932 erhielt er die Leitung an einem Forschungslabor des Russischen Museums in Leningrad, wo er bis zu seinem Tod arbeitete. Trotz der staatlichen Anordnung, die avantgardistische Tendenzen verbot und die Stilrichtung des Sozialistischen Realismus forderte, wurde sein Werk im Rahmen der Ausstellung „Fünfzehn Jahre Sowjetkunst“ noch einmal gezeigt. Ab 1935 gab es jedoch keine Ausstellung seiner Werke mehr in der UdSSR; erst nach der Perestroika fand im Jahr 1988 in Sankt Petersburg eine umfassende Retrospektive mit Werken von Malewitsch statt. Im Jahr 1935 starb Malewitsch an einem Krebsleiden in Leningrad. Sein Grab lag in Nemtschinowka bei Moskau auf dem Gelände seiner Datscha, auf dem ein von Nikolai Suetin entworfener weißer Kubus mit einem schwarzen Quadrat auf der Vorderseite aufgestellt war. Die Grabstätte existiert heute nicht mehr.

G;|Maurice Blondel (* 2. November 1861 in Dijon; † 4. Juni 1949 in Aix-en-Provence) war ein französischer christlicher Philosoph. Blondel entwickelte eine Philosophie der Aktion, mit der er den Gegensatz von Freiheit und Notwendigkeit überwinden wollte. Menschliche Aktivität und das Sein werden dabei als eine dynamisch-dialektische Einheit aufgefasst. Sein Denken umfasst eine (mögliche) Offenbarung Gottes in katholischer Tradition.  Blondel besuchte das Lycée in Dijon und studierte an der Universität Dijon, wobei vor allem sein Studium bei Henri Joly zu Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz für ihn wichtig blieb (Abschlüsse: „licence ès lettres“, „baccalauréat de droit“). Danach besuchte er ab 1881 die École normale supérieure in Paris, wo er bereits am 5. November 1882 erste Notizen über die „Action“ verfasste, die Urzelle seiner Dissertation. Hier gehörten der „lebensphilosophisch“ ausgerichtete christliche Gelehrte Léon Ollé-Laprune (1839–1898) neben dem Philosophiehistoriker und Wissenschaftstheoretiker Émile Boutroux zu seinen Lehrern. Auch das Denken des „Kantianers“ Jules Lachelier (1832–1918) wurde für ihn wichtig. Von seinen Mitschülern ist sein Freund Victor Delbos zu nennen, dessen Dissertation Le problème moral dans la philosophie de Spinoza et dans l'histoire du Spinozisme in manchem ein Parallelwerk zu Blondels Arbeit darstellt. Blondel scheiterte zwei Mal, 1884 und 1885, an seiner Agrégation, bestand 1886 und unterrichtete an den Lycées in Chaumont, Montauban und Aix-en-Provence. 1893 promovierte er an der Sorbonne in Paris mit L'Action. Versuch einer Kritik des Lebens und einer Wissenschaft der Praxis, mit der er eine neue christliche Philosophie vorlegen wollte. 1896 übernahm er nach einem Lehrverbot Lehraufträge in Lille und Aix, wo er 1899 zum Titularprofessor ernannt, jedoch nie ordentlicher Professor wurde. 1927 wurde er wegen seiner Erblindung vorzeitig in den Ruhestand versetzt. Blondel dachte in eigenständiger Weise die Philosophie der Neuzeit (René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Nicolas Malebranche, Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Positivismus) weiter. Er schuf eine Philosophie, die vom „Immanenzprinzip“ dieser Denker ausging, das er mit der Annahme von Transzendenz und der Vorstellung einer geschichtlichen Offenbarung im Christentum zu verbinden suchte. L'Action (1893) Blondels Promotionsthema an der Sorbonne wurde „l’action“, die Untersuchung der Handlung, des Tuns, des Lebensvollzugs. Ein Stichwort, das damals nicht im maßgeblichen philosophischen Lexikon von Adolphe Franck zu finden war. Dennoch lag das Thema dem metaphysisch-spiritualistisch ausgerichteten französischen Denken des 19. Jahrhunderts nicht fern. In dem Standardwerk „Rapport sur la philosophie française“ (1868) von Félix Ravaisson liest man als Prognose zur künftigen Philosophie: „Nach vielen Anzeichen darf man also wohl eine neue Epoche der Philosophie voraussagen, die ihr wesentliches Gepräge durch die Vorherrschaft eines geistigen Realismus oder Positivismus erhalten wird [réalisme ou positivisme spiritualiste], der seinen Ausgangspunkt in dem Bewußtsein des Geistes von einem in ihm selbst enthaltenen Wirklichen hat, aus dem sich alle andere Wirklichkeit ableitet, und das nichts anderes ist als sein Tätigsein [action]“, womit Ravaisson durchaus nicht auf einen solipsistischen Idealismus zielt, wie seine anschließende Bezugnahme auf Aristoteles zeigt („Aristoteles hatte gezeigt, dass das positive Prinzip der Wirklichkeit in der Tätigkeit [action] besteht ...“). Mit der Durchführung seines Themas schließt sich Blondel nicht der empirisch-positivistischen Richtung an, die damals eine der philosophischen Möglichkeiten in seinem Umfeld darstellte und auf die sich Henri Bergson stärker bezog, sondern stellte sich in die deutsche transzendentalphilosophisch-idealistische Tradition, wie der Untertitel der Arbeit zeigt: Essai d'une critique de la vie et d'une science de la pratique – Versuch einer Kritik des Lebens und einer Wissenschaft der Praxis. Damit bezieht Blondels sich sowohl auf Kants Kritiken der reinen und praktischen Vernunft sowie der Urteilskraft, die zu einer Kritik des Lebensvollzugs weitergeführt werden sollen, wie auf Hegels „Wissenschaft“ der Logik, die ebenfalls in eine Logik der Praxis überführt werden soll. Die Vorbereitung von Blondels Hauptwerk „L’Action“ (1893) ist genau nachvollziehbar, da er die vorbereitenden Studien dokumentiert und die Redaktionsstufen aufbewahrt hat. Die Sammlung seiner „notes philosophiques“ ist in elektronischer Form ediert, die gleichzeitigen geistlichen Tagebücher – die ebenfalls wesentliches Reflexionsmaterial für die Arbeit enthalten – sind teilweise in Buchform erschienen. Das Material hat Blondel in großen „plans“ zusammengefasst und danach eine erste Ausarbeitung (Premier brouillon, 1888/90) geschrieben. Die nächste Fassung diktierte er einem jugendlichen „Sekretär“ (Dictée, 1890) und entwarf dann sein „Projet de thèse“ (1890/91), das er schließlich im „manuscrit Boutroux“ (1891/92) und der endgültigen Fassung (1893) ausarbeitete. Die Textfassungen sind insgesamt in den Archives Maurice Blondel (Louvain-la-Neuve) erhalten. Die Arbeit selbst ist ein großer philosophischer Wurf. Unter den Bewunderern war Martin Heidegger, der das Werk in seiner Ausbildungszeit gelesen hatte und später einem Schüler Blondels (Henry Duméry) mitteilte, dass er diesen für den größten zeitgenössischen philosophischen Denker in Frankreich halte. Im Kontext des laizistischen Frankreich des ausgehenden 19. Jahrhunderts ist das Werk aber dennoch eine Ausnahme. Dies wird auch aus Alfred Lassons „Jahresbericht über Erscheinungen der philosophischen Literatur in Frankreich aus den Jahren 1891-1893“ in der Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik deutlich, die als zeitgenössische Zusammenfassung hier ausführlich zitiert werden soll: „Um die Frage nach Sinn und Bedeutung des Menschenlebens zu beantworten, geht der Verfasser von der Tat als dem Grundphänomen des Lebens aus und zergliedert ihre Voraussetzungen und ihre Ziele. Er zeigt, dass um tätig zu sein man an einem unendlichen Vermögen teilhaben, und um das Bewußtsein der Tätigkeit zu haben, man die Idee dieses unendlichen Vermögens besitzen muß. In dem vernünftigen Handeln liegt die Synthese des Vermögens und der Idee des Unendlichen, und diese Synthese heißt Freiheit. Dem Satze: Im Anfang war die Tat, entspricht mit gleicher Ursprünglichkeit die Bejahung des Satzes: Im Anfang war das Wort. Dieses Reich der Wahrheit liegt gänzlich außer uns, (...) aber ebenso liegt es ganz in uns, weil wir alle seine gebieterischen Anforderungen in uns selbst vollziehen. Nichts von Tyrannei liegt in der Bestimmung des Menschen; nichts Ungewolltes in seinem Wesen; nichts in der wahrhaft objektiven Erkenntnis, was nicht aus der Tiefe des Gedanken entspränge. Das ist die Lösung des Problems, das die Tat aufgibt. Darin liegt die feste Knüpfung des Knotens, in dem exakte Wissenschaft, Metaphysik und Moral sich verschlingen. Aus der geringsten unserer Handlungen, aus der Unscheinbarkeit unter den Tatsachen braucht man nur herauszuholen, was darin liegt, um der unentrinnbaren Gegenwärtigkeit nicht einer bloßen abstrakten obersten Ursache, sondern des einzigen Urhebers und wahren Vollenders aller konkreten Realität gewiß zu werden. - Diesem Nachweis ist das Buch gewidmet. Dazu widerlegt der Verfasser zunächst alle positivistischen, naturalistischen, materialistischen Anschauungen als unverträglich mit der Tatsache der Tat; dazu zeigt er in Leib und Seele das Göttliche, Geistige, zeigt er den Zusammenhang der vernunftbegabten Geister unter einander, die ewigen idealen Grundlagen von Familie, Vaterland, Menschheit auf, geht er die niederen Formen der natürlichen Moral mit ihren endlichen Zwecken und Motiven als eine Stufenfolge sich immer weiter treibender Einseitigkeiten durch, legt er da, wie der Zusammenhang mit dem Unendlichen, dem Absoluten im dämmernden Bewußtsein sich in superstitiösen Gebräuchen und Formeln darstellt, bis der Geist sich selbst gewinnt und sein transzendentes Wesen ihm in hellem Bewußtsein aufgeht. Dann wird uns Gott gegenwärtig als das, was wir selbst nicht werden noch bloß mit unseren Kräften machen können, und doch scheinen wir Wesen, Willen und Tätigkeit nur zu haben, sofern wir ihn wollen und werden wie er ist. In der gewollten Tat vollzieht sich die geheime Ehe des menschlichen und des göttlichen Willens. Zum Leben der Vernunft und der Freiheit berufen sein, heißt an der notwendigen Freiheit Gottes teilhaben, der nicht anders kann als sich wollen. So können auch wir nicht anders als uns wollen. Nichts ist absolut gut, absolut gewollt, als was wir nicht aus uns wollen, was Gott in uns und von uns will, eine Unterwürfigkeit, die ebensosehr Unabhängigkeit ist. Wenn wir in diesem freien Wesensaustausch erkennen, dass Gott alles in uns tut, aber durch uns und mit uns, dann gibt er es uns, dass wir das alles getan haben. Wenn wir es entgegennehmen, dass er in uns wird, was er an sich ist, dann erlangen wir es, dass wir selbst sind, was er selbst ist. Was dem Gedanken unerreichbar bleibt, wird zur Wirklichkeit in tätiger Übung. Nur zwischen den Willen ist diese Einigung möglich. Nur der Tat ist es gewährt, die Liebe kund zu tun und Gott zu erringen. (...) Wir haben es mit einer gründlichen, ernsten philosophischen Gedankenarbeit zu tun, mit einer oft bewunderungswürdigen Kunst der Analyse, die mehr dialektisch als psychologisch, mit echtem Tiefsinn den Kern der Sache trifft. Die Form ist für einen deutschen Leser nicht unmittelbar anmutend, vielfach rhetorisch, wohl auch gekünstelt; man wird an St. Augustinus und St. Bernhard erinnert. (...) Es werden wenig Namen genannt, und selten kommen Anführungen vor: aber überall zeigt sich eine umfassende Belesenheit und reiche Kenntnis des Lebens wie der Wissenschaft.(...) Immerhin ist es ein genial entworfener und ausgeführter Plan, wie dieser Gegner des Intellektualismus sich den gesamten idealen Gehalt des Weltalls aus der Zergliederung der menschlichen Tätigkeit gewinnt. (...) die Zergliederung der Tat wird mit den Hilfsmitteln des logischen Gedankens vollzogen. (...) Zum christlichen Dogma sich gläubig und frei zugleich zu verhalten; auf den Geist und doch auch auf den Buchstaben zu dringen; nach reiner, voraussetzungsloser Erkenntnis zu streben und kindlich zu glauben; im Drucke des Sündenbewußtseins den hohen göttlichen Adel der Seele, im tiefsten Gefühl des Erdenleides den Himmel und die Ewigkeit präsent zu haben; in scharf ausgeprägtem Antinomismus das sittliche Leben als gesetzesfreie Bewährung der Eigentümlichkeit und Hingebung an das Absolute zu fassen und zugleich im Tode der Eigenheit das Aufgehen des wahren Lebens zu begrüßen: das alles vermag der Verfasser nur, weil er es erlebt, nicht bloß mit ausgezeichneter Kraft des Gedankens erfasst hat. Das Theologische im engeren Sinne bleibt in dem ganzen Buche außer dem Spiele; selbst seine Christologie deutet der Verfasser nur gelegentlich an.“ M. Conway betont darüber hinaus die wichtige Rolle der wissenschaftstheoretischen Überlegungen Blondels. Albert Raffelt (1978) weist auf Blondels „moralistische“ Kritik an der zeitgenössischen Dekadenzliteratur (Maurice Barrès, Paul Bourget u.a.) hin. Über die Systemgestalt seiner Arbeit schreibt A. van Hooff. Ulrich Hommes (1972) zeigt Bondels Anschlussfähigkeit für moderne Phänomenologie, Georg Schwind (2000) seinen Einfluss auf das Denken von Levinas. Auf Deutsch existiert inzwischen eine umfangreiche Literatur zu Blondel. Kritik von zwei Seiten Lassons positiver Deutung in Deutschland stand in Frankreich eine doppelte kritische Front gegenüber. Zum einen sah die laizistische Universitätsphilosophie hier ihr Grundprinzip verletzt, wie es Léon Brunschvicg in seiner Rezension in der Revue de métaphysique et de morale ausdrückte: Brunschvicg nahm das Werk jedenfalls als „thèse remarquable“ (bemerkenswerte Theorie) zur Kenntnis. Später – nach Blondels ausführlicher Verteidigung – sind beide freundschaftlich verbunden. Die anderen Gegner waren Vertreter der Neuscholastik, die Blondel einen unberechtigten und unkundigen Übergriff in die katholische Theologie unterstellten. Blondel suchte sich in seiner Arbeit Lettre sur les exigences de la pensée contemporaine en matière d'apologétique et sur la méthode de la philosophie dans l'étude du problème religieux (1896), die deutsch unter dem Titel Zur Methode der Religionsphilosophie (1974) veröffentlicht wurde, nach beiden Seiten hin zu rechtfertigen. In der Folgezeit suchte Blondel sein philosophisches Denken auf verschiedene Weise zu verbreiten: Die Publikation einer Schrift im Rahmen des Internationalen Kongresses für Philosophie in Paris (Principe élémentaire d'une logique de la vie morale, dt. bei Reifenberg), systematische und historische Aufsätze wie Le christianisme de Descartes (1896), L'illusion idéaliste (1898), schließlich eine Reihe eher populärer Artikel (z.T. unter dem Pseudonym Bernard de Sailly), die auch Parallelen in der zeitgenössischen Philosophie des Pragmatismus nennen, von denen sich Blondel später abzusetzen suchte. Der Modernismusstreit Der Auslöser des „Modernismusstreits“ ist die Auseinandersetzung um die Schrift des Exegeten Alfred Loisy L’Évangile et l’Église (1902, dt.: Evangelium und Kirche, 1904), die ihrerseits eine Widerlegung der Programmschrift Adolf von Harnacks Das Wesen des Christentums sein sollte, die zur Jahrhundertwende das Christentum im Protestantismus erfüllt sah und den Katholizismus als Abweg bezeichnete. Loisy suchte demgegenüber das Recht legitimer Entwicklung aufzuweisen und dafür Kriterien darzulegen. Er geht dabei von der modernsten protestantischen Exegese seiner Zeit aus. Blondel griff in die Auseinandersetzung um Loisys Buch zwar in vermittelnder Absicht mit seiner Artikelfolge Histoire et dogme (Geschichte und Dogma) ein, konnte aber in der kirchenpolitisch erregten Situation auch zu keinem Ausgleich beitragen. Die Auseinandersetzung führte – ebenso wie der Briefwechsel beider oder die Auseinandersetzung über Dritte (Joannès Wehrlé, Friedrich von Hügel u.a.) – letztlich nur zu einer Festigung der jeweiligen Positionen, wobei für Blondel das Problem der eschatologischen „Naherwartung“ Jesu und seines Wissens und Selbbewusstseins die Hauptpunkte der unterschiedlichen Auffassungen bildeten. Die katholische Theologe hat diese Probleme erst in der Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts in differenzierterer Weise behandelt (Karl Rahner, Helmut Riedlinger u.a.). Die Auseinandersetzungen zu Beginn des Jahrhunderts führten zu Kirchenausschlüssen und Folgestreit in schärfster Form. Die kirchlichen Verurteilungen des sogenannten „Modernismus“ (Lamentabili, Enzyklika Pascendi) und die sich darauf berufenden Überwachungsmechanismen vergifteten für lange Zeit das Arbeitsklima der katholischen Theologie. (vgl. Christoph Theobald, Gerhard Larcher.) In der Folgezeit griff Blondel in einen weiteren Bereich kirchlicher Auseinandersetzung ein. Er verteidigte die Bewegung sozialer Katholiken um die „Semaines sociales“ gegen die rechtskonservative „Action française“ (vgl. die Buchausgabe: M. Blondel: Une alliance contre nature. 2000). Zwei seiner einflussreichsten Schüler, der Jesuit Pierre Rousselot und Guy de Broglie waren hingegen überzeugte Verfechter der „Action française“, letzterer bis zur Verurteilung der Action durch Pius XI. Seine Zeitschrift Annales de philosophie chrétienne konnte nicht weiter erscheinen. Dies führte auch zu einer Entfremdung mit dem Chefredakteur Lucien Laberthonnière (1860–1932). Das spätere Werk Durch die Kontroversen und wohl auch durch den Ersten Weltkrieg erlahmte die Publikationstätigkeit Blondels bis in die Zwanziger Jahre. Blondel schrieb philosophische Aufsätze (schon 1916 zu Malebranche, zu Blaise Pascal 1923, zum Augustinusjubiläum 1930), publizierte zu zeitgenössisch diskutierten Themen wie zur Frage der Mystik (vgl. H. Wilmer), zum Problem einer christlichen Philosophie uam. Unter den erschwerten Bedingungen der Erblindung erarbeitete er schließlich noch ein umfangreiches Spätwerk, die Trilogie La Pensée (1934, 2 Bde.) L’Être et les êtres (1935) und L’Action (1936/37, 2 Bde., mit Wiederaufnahme des Werks von 1893 in Band 2, aber in völliger Überarbeitung und Ergänzung), erweitert zur (nicht vollendeten) Tetralogie La philosophie et l'Esprit chrétien (1944/46, 2 Bde.). Die Bände sind schwer lesbar, da sie unter der Bedingung der Blindheit Schwächen der Komposition aufweisen, aber reich an Materialien und Reflexionen, die noch nicht voll rezipiert sind, denn die Blondel-Literatur bezieht sich weitgehend auf das Frühwerk. |
G;|Kasimir Sewerinowitsch Malewitsch (russisch Казимир Северинович Малевич, wiss. Transliteration Kazimir Severinovič Malevič, polnisch Kazimierz Malewicz; * 11. Februarjul./ 23. Februar 1878greg. in Kiew; † 15. Mai 1935 in Leningrad) war Maler und Hauptvertreter der Russischen Avantgarde, Wegbereiter des Konstruktivismus und Begründer des Suprematismus. Beeinflusst wurde er von den französischen Spätimpressionisten, Fauves und Kubisten. Sein abstraktes suprematistisches Gemälde Das Schwarze Quadrat auf weißem Grund aus dem Jahr 1915 gilt als ein Meilenstein der Malerei der Moderne und wird als „Ikone der Moderne“ bezeichnet.  Kindheit und Jugend Der Vater Seweryn Malewicz (russ. Sewerin Antonowitsch Malewitsch, 1845–1902) und seine Mutter Ludwika (russ. Ljudwiga Alexandrowna, 1858–1942) waren Polen, die nach dem Januaraufstand von 1863, der von den russischen Truppen niedergeschlagen worden war, in die Ukraine kamen. In der Familie wurde neben Polnisch auch Ukrainisch und Russisch gesprochen. Der Vater war vermutlich technischer Angestellter in verschiedenen Fabriken der Zuckerrübenindustrie; und da dieser öfter die Arbeitsstelle wechselte, verlebte Malewitsch in kärglichen Verhältnissen eine unstete Kindheit, in der er nur eine rudimentäre schulische Ausbildung erhielt. Es folgte eine fünfjährige Ausbildung an einer Landwirtschaftsschule. Mit etwa 13 Jahren erwachte Malewitschs Interesse am Zeichnen nach der Natur. Drei Jahre später inspirierte ihn ein „Anstreicher, der das Dach anstrich und ein Grün mischte wie die Bäume, wie der Himmel. Das brachte mich auf die Idee, man könne mit dieser Farbe Baum und Himmel wiedergeben. […] Der Bleistift aber ärgerte mich sehr, und ich warf ihn schließlich weg, um zum Pinsel zu greifen.“ Ausbildung Die Familie zog im Jahr 1896 nach Kursk um, wo der Vater eine Stellung in der Verwaltung der Eisenbahngesellschaft Kursk–Moskau annahm und seinem Sohn eine Stellung als technischer Zeichner vermittelte. Malewitsch fand dort gleichgesinnte Autodidakten, die ausschließlich nach der Natur malten und denen er sich anschloss. 1901 heiratete er die Polin Kazimiera Sgleitz. Sein Vater vereitelte alle seine Versuche, sich an der Kunstakademie in Moskau zu bewerben, doch im Herbst 1904 hatte Malewitsch genügend Geld gespart, um bis 1905 ein Studium an der Schule für Malerei, Skulptur und Architektur in Moskau absolvieren zu können. Ein Initialerlebnis bedeutete für Malewitsch im Jahr 1904 der Anblick von Claude Monets Gemälde der Kathedrale von Rouen, das sich in der Sammlung des Kunstmäzens Sergei Schtschukin in Moskau befand. „Zum ersten Mal sah ich die lichterfüllten Reflexionen des blauen Himmels, die reinen, transparenten Farbtöne. […] Von diesem Moment an wurde ich Impressionist.“ Von 1905 bis 1910 setzte er seine Ausbildung mit einem Studium am privaten Atelier von Fjodor Rerberg in Moskau fort. Künstlerischer Anfang 1907 siedelte Malewitschs Familie endgültig nach Moskau über, und im gleichen Jahr fand seine erste öffentliche Ausstellung von zwölf Skizzen im Rahmen der 14. Ausstellung des Verbandes der Moskauer Künstler statt neben ebenfalls noch weitgehend unbekannten Künstlern wie Wassily Kandinsky, Michail Fjodorowitsch Larionow, Natalija Sergejewna Gontscharowa. Im Jahr 1909 heiratete Malewitsch in zweiter Ehe Sofija Rafalowitsch, die Tochter eines Psychiaters. Im folgenden Jahr nahm er an der von Larionow und Gontscharowa veranstalteten Ausstellung der Künstlergruppe „Karo-Bube“ teil. Ab 1910 begann seine neoprimitivistische Periode, in der er beispielsweise die Dielenbohnerer malte, ein Gemälde mit deutlich reduzierter Raumperspektive. Gontscharowa und Larionow trennten sich 1912 von der ihnen verwestlicht erscheinenden Gruppe „Karo-Bube“ und begründeten die Künstlervereinigung „Eselsschwanz“ in Moskau, an der sich Malewitsch beteiligte. Auf einer Ausstellung dieser Vereinigung traf er auf den Maler und Komponisten Michail Wassiljewitsch Matjuschin. Die Bekanntschaft führte zu einer anregenden Zusammenarbeit, und es entwickelte sich zwischen beiden Künstlern eine lebenslange Freundschaft. Larionow war bisher Führer der Avantgarde gewesen, doch infolge des wachsenden Anspruchs Malewitschs entwickelte sich eine Rivalität um die Führungsrolle, die ihre Ursache auch in unterschiedlichen künstlerischen Konzepten hatte. Malewitsch wandte sich dem Kubofuturismus zu, den er in St. Petersburg bei der „Union der Jugend“ während eines Vortrags als einzig vertretbare Richtung in der Kunst darstellte. Er malte bis 1913 einige Bilder in diesem Stil, beispielsweise das Gemälde Der Holzfäller. Sein Werk war auch in Übersee in der Armory Show (International Exhibition of Modern Art) in New York im Jahr 1913 vertreten. Die Oper Sieg über die Sonne, Begründung des Suprematismus Im Sommer 1913 begannen unter Malewitschs Mitwirkung in Uusikirkko (Finnland) die Arbeiten an der Komposition der Oper Sieg über die Sonne. Das futuristische Werk wurde am 3. Dezember 1913 im Lunapark-Theater in Sankt Petersburg uraufgeführt. Welimir Chlebnikow verfasste den Prolog, Alexei Krutschonych das Libretto, die Musik stammte von Michail Matjuschin und das Bühnenbild sowie die Kostüme von Malewitsch. Auf einen Bühnenvorhang malte er das erste Schwarze Quadrat. Darin liegt auch der Grund, weshalb Malewitsch die Geburtsstunde des Suprematismus in das Jahr 1913 verlegte und sich nicht auf die im eigentlichen Sinne suprematistischen Bilder von 1915 berief. Im März/April 1914 fand im „Salon des Indépendants“ in Paris eine Ausstellung statt, auf der Malewitsch mit drei Gemälden vertreten war. Im Jahr 1915 schrieb er das Manifest Vom Kubismus zum Suprematismus. Der neue malerische Realismus – mit dem Schwarzen Quadrat auf dem Umschlag − und stellte im Dezember in der Ausstellung Letzte futuristische Ausstellung „0,10“ erstmals sein suprematistisches Gemälde Das Schwarze Quadrat auf weißem Grund in der Galerie Dobytschina in Petrograd (von 1914 bis 1924 der Name für Sankt Petersburg) aus, das im Katalog als Viereck bezeichnet wurde. Die geheimnisvolle Zahl 0,10 bezeichnet eine Denkfigur: Null, weil man erwartete, dass nach der Zerstörung des Alten die Welt von Null wieder beginnen könnte, und zehn, weil sich ursprünglich zehn Künstler beteiligen wollten. Tatsächlich waren es vierzehn Künstler, die an der Ausstellung teilgenommen hatten. Malewitsch hängte sein Quadrat schräg oben in die Wandecke unter die Decke des Raumes, dort hatte gewöhnlich eine russische Ikone ihren traditionellen Platz. Zu den Ausstellenden gehörten neben Malewitsch Wladimir Tatlin, Nadeschda Udalzowa, Ljubow Popowa und Iwan Puni. Die Ausstellung, die vernichtende Kritiken erhielt, markiert jedoch den Durchbruch zur gegenstandslosen, abstrakten Kunst; das bahnbrechende Ereignis in der Kunstgeschichte fand zu dieser Zeit nicht die länderübergreifende Beachtung, da in Europa der Krieg ausgebrochen war. Malewitsch wurde im Jahr 1916 zur zaristischen Armee einberufen und verbrachte die Zeit bis zum Kriegsende in einer Schreibstube. In dieser Zeit arbeitete er weiter an seinen Gemälden sowie an den theoretischen Schriften und korrespondierte mit Matjuschin. Obgleich die russischen Avantgardegruppen unterschiedliche Theorien vertraten, was zu Kontroversen führte, gab es unter den harten Kriegsbedingungen gemeinsame Kunstausstellungen der Suprematisten unter Malewitschs Führung sowie der Konstruktivisten, deren Leitung Tatlin innehatte. Malewitsch stellte beispielsweise auf Tatlins Wunsch in gewollter Abgrenzung ältere kubofuturistische Arbeiten zur Verfügung wie Ein Engländer in Moskau, die in dessen Ausstellung Magasin in einem Kaufhaus aufgenommen wurden. Nach der Oktoberrevolution 1917 wurde Malewitsch mit der Aufsicht über die nationalen Kunstsammlungen des Kreml betraut. So wurde er Vorsitzender der Kunstabteilung des Moskauer Stadtsowjets und Meister an der zweiten „Freien staatlichen Kunstwerkstätte“ (SWOMAS) sowie Professor an den „Freien staatlichen Kunstwerkstätten“ in Petrograd. Im engeren Sinn war er weder ein engagierter Funktionär noch Revolutionär, er nutzte nur die neuen Machthaber für die Durchsetzung seiner künstlerischen Ambitionen. Seine Malerei hatte sich in der Kunstszene durchgesetzt, er erhielt beispielsweise im Herbst 1918 mit Matjuschin den Auftrag, die Dekoration für einen Kongress über die Dorfarmut im Winterpalais zu schaffen.

Malewitsch gründete dort 1920 die Gruppe UNOWIS (Bestätiger der Neuen Kunst) und konnte nach kurzer Zeit viele Anhänger um sich scharen. Seine Tochter Una wurde geboren, ihr Name leitet sich von der Künstlergruppe ab. Chagall, der in den Auseinandersetzungen über die künstlerische Ausrichtung der Schule den Machtkampf gegen Malewitsch bereits 1921 verloren hatte, emigrierte 1922 über Berlin nach Paris. Der Architekt und Grafikdesigner El Lissitzky war ein Mitglied des Instituts; in seinem Atelier gestaltete er unter anderem auch Texte von Malewitsch wie Suprematismus 34 Zeichnungen (1920). In dieser historischen Periode wurde unter Malewitschs Leitung nicht nur die Schule selbst, das Unterrichtssystem, das Kulturleben der Stadt Witebsk verändert, sondern sie beeinflusste auch den weiteren Kunstprozess der Welt. Während Malewitschs Wirken in Witebsk (Witebsker Periode) waren die Ideen des Suprematismus theoretisch und konzeptionell vollendet. Sie benötigten ein neues Milieu für die Entwicklung und für den mehrfunktionalen Dialog des Erneuerungsverhaltens dem Leben gegenüber. Zu diesem Milieu ist Witebsk geworden, das man zu dieser Zeit das zweite Paris nannte. In Witebsk wurde die Idee zur Gründung eines Museums für Moderne Kunst von Marc Chagall geboren und verwirklicht. Heute wird diese Periode „Witebsker Renaissance“ oder „Witebsker Schule“ genannt. Lehrtätigkeit von 1922 bis 1926 Im April 1922, nach Streitigkeiten mit den Behörden, die die Russische Avantgarde bekämpften, verließen Malewitsch und ein größerer Teil seiner Studenten Witebsk in Richtung Petrograd (Sankt Petersburg). 1925 schloss er nach dem Tod seiner zweiten Frau die dritte Ehe mit Natalja Andrejewna Mantschenko. Von 1923 bis 1926 war Malewitsch Leiter des Instituts für künstlerische Kultur (INChUK, ab 1925 als Staatliches Institut GINChUK anerkannt) in Petrograd. Die regimekonforme Künstlergruppe AChRR beherrschte inzwischen jedoch die sowjetische Kunstkultur – die stalinistische Ära hatte begonnen und mit ihr die Ablehnung avantgardistischer Kunst – sodass Malewitsch in Ungnade fiel und 1926 seine Stellung verlor. Daher nahm er eine Beschäftigung am Staatlichen Institut für Kunstgeschichte an. Besuch in Berlin und Dessau Im Frühjahr 1927 erhielt Malewitsch ein Visum und reiste über Warschau nach Berlin, wo während der „Großen Berliner Kunstausstellung“ in der Galerie van Diemen 70 Gemälde und seine Architektona, Gipsmodelle seiner Architekturentwürfe, gezeigt wurden. In Dessau besuchte er das Bauhaus und konnte die Publikation seiner Schrift Die gegenstandslose Welt vereinbaren, die als elfter Band in der Reihe der Bauhausbücher (begründet von Walter Gropius und László Moholy-Nagy) veröffentlicht wurde, allerdings mit einem distanzierten Vorwort der Herausgeber. Im Gegensatz zu seinen Erwartungen wurde Malewitsch zwar als bedeutender Vertreter der russischen Avantgarde aufgenommen, doch dem Bauhaus lag zu diesem Zeitpunkt der russische Konstruktivismus näher als der Suprematismus, der in Deutschland mit seinem philosophischen System der Welterkenntnis als überholt erschien. In Dessau suchte man einen Weg zu einem gestalterischen Weltentwurf, ähnlich wie die niederländische Gruppe De Stijl, deren Mitbegründer Piet Mondrian wie Malewitsch ein früher Meister der Abstraktion war. Mondrians im Jahr 1920 geschaffene Stilrichtung Neoplastizismus war beeinflusst vom emotionalen Suprematismus Malewitschs. Im Juni kehrte Malewitsch nach Leningrad zurück; er hinterließ in Deutschland wegen der unsicheren politischen Verhältnisse in der Sowjetunion seine Schriften bei seinem Gastgeber Gustav von Riesen und die mitgebrachten Werke bei dem Architekten Hugo Häring, der sie für Malewitsch verwahrte. Zu dem geplanten erneuten Besuch Malewitschs kam es nicht mehr, sodass die Gemälde erst im Jahr 1951 wiederentdeckt und 1958 für rund 120.000 Mark vom Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam angekauft wurden. Durch einen Vergleich im Mai 2008 ist der jahrelange Streit zwischen den 37 Erben Malewitschs und der Stadt Amsterdam gütlich geregelt worden. Der jetzt erzielte Vergleich beschert den Erben fünf bedeutende Werke von Malewitsch. Im Gegenzug akzeptieren sie, dass die restlichen Bilder der Sammlung der Stadt Amsterdam bleiben, wo sie von 2009 an im wiedereröffneten Stedelijk Museum ausgestellt werden sollen. Rückkehr zur figurativen Malerei Malewitsch nahm seine Tätigkeit am Staatlichen Institut für Kunstgeschichte wieder auf, entwarf Pläne für Satellitenstädte in Moskau, beschäftigte sich mit Entwürfen für Porzellan und bemühte sich, seine Forschungsergebnisse zu veröffentlichen. Indem er seine dogmatischen Ansichten leicht zu revidieren suchte, war er auf der Suche nach neuen Möglichkeiten und Wegen für seine Kunst. Die wesentlichen Werke, die er in Deutschland zurückgelassen hatte, begann Malewitsch wiederherzustellen, indem er „verbesserte“ Repliken malte, das galt auch für impressionistische Motive. Er datierte die Arbeiten zurück, was später zu großer Verwirrung in Kunstkreisen führen sollte. Die Bilder dienten zur Vervollständigung seiner großen Werkschau, die im Jahr 1929 geplant war. Einen radikalen Umbruch ab Ende der 1920er Jahre in Malewitschs Werk stellte die Rückkehr zur figurativen Malerei mit suprematistischen Elementen dar; er stellte sie in den Dienst der geliebten Bauern, die unter der Kollektivierung der Landwirtschaft zu leiden hatten, was sich in seinem neuen Stil ausdrückte. In seiner Malweise wurden die Menschen nach und nach zu verstümmelten Puppen, zu Gefangenen eines verbrecherischen Gulag. Die weitere Arbeit am Staatlichen Institut für die Geschichte der Kunst wurde ihm 1929 untersagt und das Institut wenig später geschlossen. Zwei Wochen im Monat durfte er im Kunstinstitut in Kiew arbeiten. Im November des Jahres stellte er in der Tretjakow-Galerie in Moskau anlässlich einer Retrospektive seine Werke aus, erntete aber überwiegend negative Kritik. Kurz darauf wurde die Ausstellung nach Kiew übernommen, wurde aber nach wenigen Tagen bereits wieder geschlossen. Im Jahr 1930 wurde Malewitsch festgenommen und zwei Wochen lang zu Verhören vorgeführt. In seiner letzten künstlerischen Phase, kurz vor seinem Tod, kehrte er zur Malweise „realer“ Porträts zurück, diese entsprechen jedoch nicht dem Stil des „Sozialistischen Realismus“, sondern ähneln Werken der Renaissance, die sich in der Bekleidung der Porträtierten ausdrückt. Charakteristisch an diesen Gemälden sind die ausdrucksvollen Gesten der dargestellten Personen. 1932 erhielt er die Leitung an einem Forschungslabor des Russischen Museums in Leningrad, wo er bis zu seinem Tod arbeitete. Trotz der staatlichen Anordnung, die avantgardistische Tendenzen verbot und die Stilrichtung des Sozialistischen Realismus forderte, wurde sein Werk im Rahmen der Ausstellung „Fünfzehn Jahre Sowjetkunst“ noch einmal gezeigt. Ab 1935 gab es jedoch keine Ausstellung seiner Werke mehr in der UdSSR; erst nach der Perestroika fand im Jahr 1988 in Sankt Petersburg eine umfassende Retrospektive mit Werken von Malewitsch statt. Im Jahr 1935 starb Malewitsch an einem Krebsleiden in Leningrad. Sein Grab lag in Nemtschinowka bei Moskau auf dem Gelände seiner Datscha, auf dem ein von Nikolai Suetin entworfener weißer Kubus mit einem schwarzen Quadrat auf der Vorderseite aufgestellt war. Die Grabstätte existiert heute nicht mehr.

G;|Clemens Heinrich Krauss (* 31. März 1893 in Wien; † 16. Mai 1954 in Mexiko-Stadt) war ein österreichischer Dirigent und Theaterleiter. Krauss wurde vor allem als Interpret der Werke von Richard Strauss bekannt; er verfasste das Libretto zu dessen Oper Capriccio mit.  Jugend und Beginn der Karriere Der uneheliche Sohn der Hofoperntänzerin und späteren Sängerin Clementine Krauss (* 25. April 1877 in Wien; † 19. April 1938 in Prag) und des Rennreiters Hector (Theodore) Baltazzi (* 1851 (evtl. 1854?); † 2. Januar 1916 in Wien) wurde 1902 Hofsängerknabe an der Wiener Hofmusikkapelle. Er studierte Klavier, Komposition und Chorleitung am Konservatorium der Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Wien und wurde 1913 Chordirektor in Brünn. Nach Stationen am Deutschen Theater in Riga (1913–1914), Nürnberg (1915–1916), Stettin (1916–1921) und Graz (1921) war er von 1922 bis 1924 unter Franz Schalk und Richard Strauss Dirigent am Wiener Operntheater. 1924 ging Krauss als Intendant an die Frankfurter Oper und leitete gleichzeitig die Museumskonzerte. 1929 wurde er als Musikdirektor an die Wiener Staatsoper berufen. Wirken während der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus Nach der Machtergreifung der Nationalsozialisten in Deutschland war Krauss bereit, die bewusst als antinationalsozialistisches Stück verfasste Oper „Karl V.“ von Ernst Krenek in Wien im Februar 1934 uraufzuführen. Auf massiven Druck von Nationalsozialisten, Funktionären der Heimwehr und auch des Vorstandes der Wiener Philharmoniker musste Krauss die geplante Uraufführung jedoch verschieben. Zusätzlich brachte ihm dieser Einsatz ein Disziplinarverfahren ein. Im selben Jahr erhielt er jedoch das Angebot von Hermann Göring, als Ersatz für Wilhelm Furtwängler an die Berliner Staatsoper zu wechseln. Beispielhaft für die angespannte Situation in Wien ist eine Falstaff-Aufführung am 11. Dezember 1934, bei der es zu lautstarken Kundgebungen für und gegen Krauss kam, die erst durch die Polizei aufgelöst werden konnten. Angesichts der prekären Lage in Wien und des Wunsches seiner Ehefrau Viorica Ursuleac, die sich in Berlin mehr Möglichkeiten für Solopartien versprach, entschloss sich Krauss im Dezember 1934 zum Wechsel nach Berlin; neben seiner Ehefrau folgten ihm auch Franz Völker und Josef von Manowarda nach Deutschland. Gegenüber den hohen NS-Funktionären in Berlin stellte sich Krauss als Opfer politischer Verfolgung dar und beklagte den kulturpolitischen Schaden, der in Wien entstanden sei. Krauss suchte direkten Kontakt mit Adolf Hitler, der den Dirigenten sehr schätzte und ihn Ende 1935 ins Haus Wachenfeld einlud. Hitler stellte Krauss bei diesem Treffen eine Berufung nach München in Aussicht. Ab 1936 wirkte er daher an der Bayerischen Staatsoper in München, wurde 1937 zum Generalmusikdirektor ernannt (bis 1944) und hatte dort bis 1940 auch die Intendanz inne. Streben zurück zur Wiener Staatsoper Nach dem „Anschluss“ Österreichs an das nationalsozialistische Deutschland am 10. April 1938 wollte Clemens Krauss erneut Direktor der Wiener Staatsoper werden. Bereits am 25. April 1938 schrieb er einen Brief an Hitler und machte Vorschläge für seinen Wiedereinzug in Wien. Clemens Krauss’ Ansuchen wurde indirekt negativ beschieden. Noch kurz zuvor hatte Krauss zu jenen gehört, die einen Kulturaustausch mit Wien verhindern wollten. 1940 schrieb Krauss wieder einen Brief in dieser Sache. Krauss strebte die freigewordene Position des Direktors der Wiener Akademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst an. Er klärte seine Möglichkeiten mit Propagandaminister Goebbels ab. Es sei Krauss eine vertrauliche Mitteilung zugegangen, dass „„Hitler im Zuge sehr intensiver Bemühungen maßgebender Kreise in Wien, die [Krauss] für eine leitende Position gewinnen wollten“, nun entschieden habe, der Münchner Intendant müsse sich voll auf München konzentrieren.“ Krauss schlug vor, auch in Wien eine dem Salzburger Mozarteum angenäherte Lösung anzustreben, dessen Leiter er bereits am 13. Juni 1939 geworden war. „Die Wiener Akademie solle von einer Persönlichkeit geleitet werden, die dem Wiener Boden entstammt“, schrieb Krauss an Ministerialrat Bade im Propagandaministerium. Am 23. Februar 1941 hatte Krauss eine Unterredung mit Wiens Gauleiter Baldur von Schirach, der Krauss gern in Wien gehabt hätte. Es wurde vereinbart, dass eine zukünftige Tätigkeit von Krauss in Wien als „reine Gastspiele zu deklarieren sind, damit der Führer sich nicht ärgert“. Im Mai 1941 hatte Krauss nach sechs Jahren wieder eine Unterredung mit Hitler, in der es nur um Krauss’ Wiener Ambitionen ging. Hitler lehnte es rundherum ab, Krauss nach Wien gehen zu lassen. Am 13. September erfolgte die Ernennung zum Leiter der Salzburger Festspiele. Beziehung zum Mozarteum Goebbels klärte am 17. November 1938 zusammen mit Krauss einige Fragen über die Zukunft des Mozarteums in Salzburg. Krauss erklärte sich dazu bereit, die Leitung zu übernehmen und eine fundierte Dirigentenschule aufzubauen. Auf seine Initiative hin wurde das Mozarteum am 13. Juni 1939 zur Musikhochschule erklärt. Clemens Krauss wurde am selben Tag gegen den Widerstand der Gauleitung München zum Oberleiter der Musikhochschule Mozarteum und Leiter der Stiftung Mozarteum ernannt. Die Gauleitung in München sprach Krauss die politische Eignung für dieses Amt mit der Begründung ab, dass er weder Mitglied der NSDAP noch anderer NS-Verbände sei. Die Beziehung zu Hitler und zu Goebbels schützten Krauss jedoch vor diesen Einwänden; zudem bescheinigten die Wiener NSDAP-Stellen Krauss, stets nationalsozialistisch eingestellt gewesen zu sein. Während des feierlichen Eröffnungsakts der Musikhochschule Mozarteum waren der preußische Kultusminister und Reichsminister für Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung, Bernhard Rust, Gauleiter Friedrich Rainer und hohe Vertreter der NSDAP im Großen Saal des Mozarteums anwesend. Clemens Krauss sprach während seiner Ansprache folgende Worte: Ich übernehme in diesem feierlichen Moment die künstlerische Oberleitung der Musikhochschule. Ich gelobe an dieser Stelle, das mir anvertraute Gut als eine hohe Schule der Kunst zu führen mit all der Ehrfurcht, die uns Künstler in dieser Stadt befällt, wo Mozart als Schüler gelernt, mit tiefer Demut vor dem Genius Mozart und vor dem vorwärts stürmenden erhabenen Meister und Künstler Adolf Hitler. Salzburger Festspiele 1939 Festspiel-Direktor Erwin Kerber wurde am 9. Dezember 1938 in das Propagandaministerium nach Berlin beordert und bekam das mit Hitler bereits besprochene und von diesem fixierte Programm der Salzburger Festspiele 1939 diktiert. Die Festspiele sollten vom 30. Juli bis zum 6. September dauern und neben Oper und Schauspiel auch Konzerte beinhalten. Auserwählte Dirigenten waren Leopold Stokowski, Victor de Sabata und Willem Mengelberg, jedoch nicht Clemens Krauss. Im Weiteren wurde Kerber mitgeteilt, dass „das Propaganda-Ministerium der eigentliche und verantwortliche Veranstalter der Festspiele ist.“ Am 8. April 1939 kündigte die österreichische Volks-Zeitung das Salzburger Johann-Strauß-Konzert bei der Vorstellung des vom Reichspropagandaministerium endgültig festgelegten Spielplanes der Salzburger Festspiele 1939 an. Aus Joseph Goebbels’ Ansprache am 21. Mai 1939 auf der Kulturpolitischen Kundgebung im Rahmen der 2. Reichsmusiktage in Düsseldorf 1939: Exakt zwei Monate nach der Eröffnung der Musikhochschule Mozarteum gaben die Wiener Philharmoniker unter Leitung von Clemens Krauss am 13. August 1939 im Großen Saal des Mozarteums ihr „Drittes Orchesterkonzert“ im Rahmen der Salzburger Festspiele 1939. Das Programm dieses Konzertes war identisch mit dem des „Außerordentlichen Konzerts“ der Wiener Philharmoniker unter der Leitung von Clemens Krauss am 31. Dezember 1939 im Goldenen Saal des Wiener Musikvereins, das als Beginn der Neujahrskonzerte der Wiener Philharmoniker gilt. Auf Krauss geht daher das zur Tradition gewordene Neujahrskonzert der Wiener Philharmoniker zurück. Künstlerischer Leiter der Salzburger Festspiele ab 1941 Im Jahr 1941 sah Krauss die Salzburger Festspiele 1942 in Gefahr, „dem Zugriff der Berliner kunstpolitischen Stellen zum Opfer zu fallen.“ Die Festspiele sollten durch Reichsdramaturg Rainer Schlösser und die Musikstelle des Propagandaministeriums geleitet werden. „Es war geplant, den Wiener Philharmonikern ihr Vorrecht auf Salzburg zu entziehen, die Schauspielaufführungen mit Berliner Künstlern durchzuführen etc.“ Auf Bitten der damaligen Salzburger Behörden stellte sich Krauss für die Leitung der Salzburger Festspiele zur Verfügung. Krauss hatte im Dritten Reich zahlreiche künstlerische Tätigkeiten inne. Am 13. September 1941 erhielt Clemens Krauss von Hitler den Auftrag, die Salzburger Festspiele als künstlerischer Leiter zu übernehmen. Krauss wachte nach eigener Aussage „kraft [seiner] künstlerischen Autorität darüber, daß den Festspielen der österreichische Charakter gewahrt blieb.“ Gegenüber dem Wiener Reichsleiter Baldur von Schirach betonte Krauss, dass er „nach wie vor Wert darauf lege, daß die Wiener Staatsoper bei diesen Festspielen maßgeblich vertreten sei, allerdings käme eine solche Einladung nur für jene Körperschaften in Betracht, die noch intakt und auf künstlerischer Höhe sind.“ Reichsleiter von Schirach stimmte seiner Bitte zu und versicherte Krauss der Teilnahme der Wiener Philharmoniker an den Festspielen. Zu seiner Überraschung bekam Krauss kurz darauf eine Nachricht der Reichsstatthalterei, in der es hieß, eine Teilnahme der Wiener Philharmoniker und auch des Staatsopernchores an den Salzburger Festspielen für dieses Jahr komme nicht in Frage. Die Staatsoper habe ab dem 15. August Wehrmachtsvorstellungen in Wien zu geben. Diese Mitteilung reichte Krauss an Goebbels weiter und bat um eine neuerliche Entscheidung. Als Kompromiss stellte von Schirach Krauss die Bedingung, die gesamte Wiener Staatsoper mit Georg Friedrich Händels Rodelinde auftreten zu lassen. Diesen Vorschlag musste Krauss ablehnen, da es der Wunsch des Führers und Goebbels’ war, die Einmaligkeit der Salzburger Festspiele zu erhalten. Um dies zu gewährleisten, müssten „bei den Festspielen in Salzburg nur Opern und Schauspiele in einer bisher nicht gekannten Besetzung, Auffassung, Inszenierung und bis ins kleinste sauberen Einstudierung herausgebracht werden und weder vor- noch nachher in irgendeiner Stadt Großdeutschlands in der in Salzburg herausgebrachten Aufmachung zur Aufführung gelangen.“ Der Reichsstatthalter blieb auf seinem ablehnenden Standpunkt. Daraufhin versuchte Krauss, die Sache an das Oberkommando der Wehrmacht in Berlin weiterzuleiten, um dadurch zu einer Einigung zu kommen. Um aber die Salzburger Festspiele nicht zu gefährden, traf er mit Goebbels die Vereinbarung, falls eine Einigung mit Wien nicht erreicht werden könne, für die Opernaufführungen das Münchener Staatsorchester und den Opernchor, und für die Konzerte die Berliner Philharmoniker einzuladen. Zur weiteren Bekundung seiner freundschaftlichen Einstellung zu Wien lud Krauss das Wiener Burgtheater unter der Führung von Lothar Müthel ein. Das Burgtheater sollte neue Inszenierungen von Iphigenie auf Tauris und Johann Nestroys Einen Jux will er sich machen aufführen. So erfüllte er den langgehegten Wunsch des Burgtheaters, als geschlossenes Ensemble bei den Festspielen aufzutreten. Zuletzt wurde dann doch eine Einigung erzielt, doch nur unter der Bedingung, dass die Wiener Philharmoniker die Opern nicht als Wiener Philharmonie spielen, sondern als Staatsopernorchester. Die Konzerte sollten lediglich als von den Wiener Philharmonikern aufgeführt gekennzeichnet werden dürfen. Streit mit den Wiener Philharmonikern ab 1933 Seit April 1933 hatten Clemens Krauss und die Wiener Philharmoniker in Streit gelegen. Bei der Hauptversammlung der Wiener Philharmoniker vom 24. April 1933 hatten 85 Mitglieder in einer geheimen Abstimmung „die offene Kampfansage an Direktor Krauss“ befürwortet. „Damit war das Ende der Ära Krauss besiegelt.“ Am Folgetag, dem 25. April, hatte Clemens Krauss in sein Datenbuch eingetragen: „Wegen einer inferiören Handlungsweise eines neu gewählten Vorstandes der Wiener Philharmoniker lege ich mein Amt als ständiger Dirigent der philharmonischen Abonnementskonzerte nieder.“ Die „offizielle Versöhnung mit dem Orchester“ erfolgte am 27. März 1943. Bezüglich dieser schrieb Philharmonikervorstand Clemens Hellsberg in Demokratie der Könige im Kapitel Volkssturmeinheit Wiener Philharmoniker: „Während die Rote Armee schon vor den Toren Wiens stand, spielten die Philharmoniker unter der Leitung von Krauss Werke Debussys und Ravels ein!“ Beides waren damals verbotene Kompositionen aus dem „Feindesland“. „Der ehemalige Operndirektor war der einzige prominente Dirigent, der sich nicht abgesetzt hatte. Furtwängler und Karl Böhm waren ‚krank‘ gemeldet, aber Clemens Krauss blieb in Wien, bei den Philharmonikern und machte damit vieles wieder gut. Die offizielle Versöhnung mit dem Orchester war schon am 27. März 1943 erfolgt, als Krauss anlässlich seines 50. Geburtstags den Ehrenring der Wiener Philharmoniker erhalten und vor versammeltem Plenum betont hatte, für ihn als Leiter der Salzburger Festspiele kämen nur die Wiener Philharmoniker als Orchester des Festivals in Betracht.“ Der Vertreter der Wiener Philharmoniker, Leopold Kainz, schrieb am 1. August 1942 in seinem „Gedächtnisprotokoll“ über seine Aussprache mit Clemens Krauss: Gründungsdirigent der Neujahrskonzerte der Wiener Philharmoniker Clemens Krauss ist der Gründungsdirigent der Neujahrskonzerte der Wiener Philharmoniker im Jahre 1941; er leitete diese bis 1945 und wieder von 1948 bis zu seinem Todesjahr 1954. Das erste Konzert dieser Art hatte bereits am 31. Dezember 1939 ebenfalls unter Leitung von Krauss stattgefunden. Erst mit dem Jahr 1941 fand es dann am Neujahrstag statt. In den Jahren des Berufsverbotes Krauss’ leitete der international renommierte österreichische Dirigent Josef Krips 1946 und 1947 das Neujahrskonzert. Letzte Kriegsjahre und Nachkriegszeit Krauss wurde ab 1943 immer wieder das Ziel politischer Intrigen. Im selben Jahr war er anlässlich seines 50. Geburtstags als Preisträger der Goethe-Medaille vorgesehen, doch lehnte Goebbels mit Hinweis auf Krauss’ Alter ab. Kritik an einer Aufführung der Zauberflöte bei den Salzburger Festspielen ebenfalls 1943 durch Heinz Drewes wusste Krauss, der stets gut informiert schien, mit entsprechenden „Gegenschriften“ zu entkräften. Er nutzte seine politischen Verbindungen aus, um in den letzten Kriegsjahren Vorteile für sein Ensemble herauszuschlagen. So sicherte er sich etwa für Mitglieder seines Ensembles sechs „arisierte“ Wohnungen. Weitere, vereinzelte Intrigen von NS-Funktionären beim „Amt Rosenberg“ gegen Kraus blieben mit Hinweis auf die schützende Hand Hitlers erfolglos. In der Endphase des Zweiten Weltkriegs, als zum 1. September 1944 die Theater geschlossen wurden, stand Krauss auf der Gottbegnadeten-Liste, einer vom Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda und Hitler zusammengestellten Liste, in der die wichtigsten Künstler des NS-Regimes aufgeführt waren. Diese Nennung befreite ihn vom Kriegseinsatz. In einem Brief an Oberregierungsrat Horner vom Amt für Sicherheitswesen der Stadt Salzburg nahm Clemens Krauss nach Kriegsende am 30. November 1945 Stellung zu den gegen ihn erhobenen Vorwürfen: Die „recht alte verschlampte Vorstellung von ‚Don Giovanni‘“ war die Wiederaufnahme der Produktion der Salzburger Festspiele von 1938 unter Dirigent Karl Böhm. Clemens Krauss erwähnte in seinem langen Brief an das Amt für Sicherheitswesen in Salzburg weder das von ihm geleitete Johann-Strauss-Konzert der Salzburger Festspiele vom 13. August 1939 noch die zwei weiteren von ihm geleiteten Strauss-Konzerte vom 23. August 1942 und 22. August 1943. Nach der Schlacht um Wien dirigierte Krauss am 27. April 1945 auf ausdrücklichen Wunsch der sowjetischen Kulturverwaltung in Wien ein Konzert der Wiener Philharmoniker. Danach wurde er jedoch mit Berufsverbot belegt; erst 1947 dirigierte Clemens Krauss wieder regelmäßig an der Wiener Staatsoper, bei den Wiener Philharmonikern und 1953 Richard Wagners Ring des Nibelungen und Parsifal bei den Bayreuther Festspielen. Krauss war in erster Ehe mit der Sängerin Margarete Abraham (*1889, †1963) verheiratet. Er hatte aus dieser Ehe zwei Söhne: Octavian Krauss, Rechtsanwalt (*1923 - 2. März 2004), Oliver Hector Krauss-Baltazzi, Schauspieler, Autor (* 1926). Zweite Ehe mit der rumänischen Sopranistin Viorica Ursuleac. Er verstarb während einer Konzertreise in Mexiko. Beigesetzt ist er in Ehrwald in Tirol. |
G;|Boubou Hama (* 1906 in Fonéko; † 29. Januar 1982 in Niamey) war ein nigrischer Politiker und Intellektueller. Hama gehörte der Ethnie der Songhai an und war der Sohn eines entkommenen Sklaven. Er arbeitete zunächst als Lehrer für die Kolonialverwaltung Frankreichs in Niger. Ab 1946 engagierte er sich politisch in der Nigrischen Fortschrittspartei (PPN-RDA). Im 1960 von Frankreich unabhängig gewordenen Niger lenkte er als Parteivorsitzender und Parlamentspräsident neben Staatspräsident Hamani Diori die Geschicke des Staates. Nach dem Sturz des Einparteiensystems durch einen Militärputsch 1974 verbrachte er drei Jahre in Gefangenschaft. Boubou Hama veröffentlichte zahlreiche belletristische Werke, anthropologische Schriften und Essays. Zu seinen bekanntesten Romanen zählt Kotia-Nima (1968). In vielen seiner Arbeiten setzte er sich mit einem afrikanischen Denken auseinander, in dem er einen Beitrag zur globalen Zivilisation sah.  Aufstieg vom Sohn eines Sklaven zum Lehrer im Kolonialdienst Boubou Hama wurde im zur Stadt Téra gehörenden Songhai-Viertel Fonéko geboren, das seit Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts unter französischer Kolonialherrschaft stand. Als sein Geburtsjahr wird in offiziellen Dokumenten 1906 angegeben, während er selbst gelegentlich auch das Jahr 1909 nannte. Hama stammte aus einer niedrigen sozialen Schicht der Songhai-Gesellschaft. Sein Vater wurde Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts im Zuge der kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen zwischen Téra und Yagha gefangen genommen und musste lange Zeit als Sklave in der Gegend von Sebba verbringen, bis es ihm gelang zu entkommen und in seinen Heimatort Fonéko zurückzukehren. Dort heiratete er Boubou Hamas spätere Mutter, die wie er aus einfachen Verhältnissen kam. Der Dorfchef von Fonéko sandte den jungen Boubou Hama auf die „Schule der Weißen“, damit seine eigenen Söhne diesbezüglich nicht behelligt würden. Nach der Elementarschule in Téra besuchte Hama von 1918 bis 1924 die Regionalschule in Dori. Danach ging er von 1924 bis 1926 auf die höhere Grundschule in Ouagadougou. Wegen seiner herausragenden schulischen Leistungen wurde er 1926 auf die École normale supérieure William Ponty in Senegal geschickt. Dies war die Kaderschmiede für die einheimische Bevölkerung Französisch-Westafrikas, an der viele später einflussreiche Politiker und Gelehrte ihre Ausbildung erhielten. Hama diplomierte dort 1929. Zu seinem Abschlussjahrgang gehörten die späteren Schriftsteller Abdoulaye Sadji und Ousmane Socé Diop. Er war anschließend im Kolonialdienst als erster aus Niger stammender Französisch-Lehrer tätig. Fünf Jahre lang unterrichtete an der Grundschule in Niamey, der Hauptstadt Nigers, und wechselte danach an die Grundschule in Tillabéri. Als ihm vorgeworfen wurde, Bauern in der Region zum Aufstand gegen Ungerechtigkeiten der Kolonialherrschaft anzustiften, wurde er 1938 zurück nach Niamey versetzt. 1942 lernte er den in Niger tätigen französischen Anthropologen und Filmregisseur Jean Rouch kennen, mit dem ihn eine lebenslange Freundschaft verband. Boubou Hama war verheiratet und hatte mehrere Töchter und Söhne. In seiner Ehe sah er exemplarisch die Synthese Europas und Afrikas verwirklicht: als Bund zwischen seiner europäischen Bildung und der davon unberührten afrikanischen Herkunft seiner Frau. Beginn der politischen Tätigkeit unter französischer Herrschaft Die Konferenz von Brazzaville im Jahr 1944 läutete einen Veränderungsprozess im Verhältnis des Mutterlands Frankreich zu seinen Kolonien ein, der stufenweise mehr Autonomie, Gleichberechtigung und politische Partizipation für die einheimische Bevölkerung der Kolonien brachte. Die wirtschaftlich unbedeutende Kolonie Niger war innerhalb des französischen Kolonialreichs politisch marginalisiert. Um den Einfluss der einheimischen Bevölkerung Nigers gegenüber politischen Vertretern aus anderen Teilen Französisch-Westafrikas zu stärken, trafen sich 1945 junge, europäisch gebildete Nigrer heimlich auf einer Insel im Niger. Die Gruppe, die sich als „zweite Konferenz von Brazzaville“ verstand, wählte Boubou Hama zu ihrem Anführer. Sie begann gegen die Kolonialverwaltung zu agitieren. Jean Toby, der französische Gouverneur Nigers, ließ daraufhin Boubou Hama noch 1945 aus der Hauptstadt Niamey entfernen und entsandte ihn als Schuldirektor nach Dori. Aus diesem Grund konnte Hama nicht persönlich an der Gründungsversammlung der Nigrischen Fortschrittspartei (PPN-RDA), der ersten politischen Partei Nigers, teilnehmen, die am 12. Mai 1946 in Niamey stattfand. Er gründete in Dori eine PPN-RDA-Sektion. Der PPN-RDA war eine Mitgliedspartei der Afrikanischen Demokratischen Sammlung (RDA), an deren Gründungskongress, der im Oktober 1946 in Bamako abgehalten wurde, Hama als Mitglied der PPN-Delegation teilnahm. Als Niger einen Sitz in der Nationalversammlung Frankreichs zugesprochen bekam, wäre es naheliegend gewesen, dass sich dafür für den PPN-RDA mit Issoufou Saïdou Djermakoye der Parteivorsitzende zur Wahl gestellt hätte. Boubou Hama gelang es jedoch, Hamani Diori, seinen ehemaligen Schüler in der Grundschule von Niamey, innerparteilich als Kandidat durchzusetzen. Saïdou Djermakoye nahm ohne Listenzugehörigkeit an der Wahl teil, die von Diori gewonnen wurde. Letzterer setzte sich erfolgreich bei René Barthes, dem Generalgouverneur Französisch-Westafrikas, dafür ein, dass Boubou Hama von Dori zurück nach Niamey versetzt wurde. Bei den Wahlen zum Generalrat am 15. Dezember 1946 wurde Hama im Wahlkreis Tillabéri in den Generalrat, das erste Parlament Nigers, gewählt. Es folgten am 13. Januar 1947 seine Wahl als Vertreter Nigers in die Versammlung der Französischen Union in Paris – diese Funktion hatte er bis 1952 inne – und im Juli 1948 seine Wahl als PPN-RDA-Abgeordneter in den Großen Rat von Französisch-Westafrika in Dakar. Der Partei wehte starker Gegenwind seitens der Kolonialverwaltung entgegen. Gouverneur Toby initiierte 1948 die Gründung der ihm loyalen Partei Union unabhängiger Nigrer und Sympathisanten (UNIS), der sich der ehemalige PPN-RDA-Vorsitzende Saïdou Djermakoye anschloss. Im Januar des Folgejahres nahm Boubou Hama an einer Versammlung der PPN-RDA-Mutterpartei RDA in Treichville teil. Zu dem Treffen reisten auch Kommunisten aus Metropolitan-Frankreich an. Es war von einer antiimperialistischen Stimmung geprägt. Die führenden Politiker des PPN-RDA waren sich bezüglich ihrer Positionierung uneinig. Ein moderater Flügel um Boubou Hama und Hamani Diori wollte den radikalen Konfrontationskurs gegenüber der Kolonialverwaltung aufgeben. Ihm stand eine Gruppe um Djibo Bakary, den Generalsekretär der Partei, gegenüber, die weitermachen wollte wie bisher. In dieser politisch angespannten Zeit erhielt Boubou Hama einen Posten, der es ihm ermöglichte sich intensiv mit afrikanischer Kultur und Wissenschaft auseinanderzusetzen: Er wurde 1950 Direktor des Institut Français d’Afrique Noire du Niger, aus dem später das Nigrische Nationalmuseum hervorging. Die Grundlage für das Museum bildeten Hamas umfangreiche archäologische, ethnographische und paläontologische Sammlungen. Der PPN-RDA, als dessen Sekretär für wirtschaftliche Angelegenheiten Hama von 1952 bis 1956 fungierte, musste eine Serie von Rückschlägen hinnehmen. Bei den Wahlen zur Territorialversammlung am 30. März 1952 triumphierte die UNIS. Hama versuchte durch die Gründung der Wochenzeitung Le Niger zugunsten des PPN-RDA publizistisch gegenzusteuern. Doch bereits mit seiner – trotz des Unterstützung des Ex-UNIS-Politikers Georges Condat – gescheiterten Wiederwahl in die Versammlung der Französischen Union musste er eine persönliche Niederlage hinnehmen, die für die Partei einen Schock bedeutete. Die internen Richtungsstreitigkeiten führten schließlich dazu, dass sich der PPN-RDA-Generalsekretär Djibo Bakary 1954 mit einer eigenen Partei abspaltete. Weg zur Macht Hama übernahm 1956 von Daddy Gaoh den Parteivorsitz des PPN-RDA, den er bis Auflösung der Partei 1974 innehatte. Im selben Jahr erfolgte bei den nach dem Tod eines Abgeordneten einberufenen Teilwahlen seine Wiederwahl in das Parlament Nigers. Während die UNIS aufgrund interner Krisen in der Bedeutungslosigkeit versunken war, erwuchs dem PPN-RDA in Djibo Bakarys Partei Sawaba ein starker Konkurrent um die politische Macht. Als Ergebnis der Kommunalwahlen in Niamey am 18. November 1956 wurde Bakary Bürgermeister der Hauptstadt, während sich Boubou Hama mit dem Amt des Vizebürgermeisters begnügen musste. Bei den Wahlen zur Territorialversammlung am 31. März 1957 wurde Hama im Wahlkreis Tillabéri in das Parlament Nigers wiedergewählt, jedoch ging die Mandatsmehrheit an den Sawaba. Als Niger infolge der Wahlen seine erste eigene Regierung zusammenstellen konnte, handelte es sich um eine Sawaba-Regierung, die Boubou Hama noch 1957 von seinem Posten als Direktor des Institut Français d’Afrique Noire du Niger entließ. Den entscheidenden Umschwung brachte das Verfassungsreferendum am 28. September 1958 mit sich. Dabei warb der Sawaba für ein Nein und damit für die sofortige Unabhängigkeit Nigers von Frankreich, während sich der PPN-RDA für ein Ja und somit für einen Verbleib innerhalb der Communauté française einsetzte. Der Wahlausgang für ein Ja machte den PPN-RDA zur Partei des Vertrauens der französischen Verwaltung, während sich der Sawaba Repressionen ausgesetzt sah. Diese führten letztlich am 12. Oktober 1959 zu einem Verbot des Sawaba und zur Etablierung eines Einparteiensystems des PPN-RDA. Zwischenzeitlich verdrängte der PPN-RDA bei den Wahlen zur Territorialversammlung am 14. Dezember 1958 (und endgültig bei den Nachwahlen vom 27. Juni 1959) den Sawaba von der Macht. Boubou Hama wurde zum Parlamentspräsidenten gewählt, eine Funktion, die er bis 1974 ausübte. Am 23. Januar 1959 revanchierte er sich für seine Wahlniederlage gegen Djibo Bakary um den Bürgermeistersessel von Niamey: Der Gemeinderat wurde aufgelöst und Hama zum Präsidenten der Sonderdelegation der Stadt Niamey ernannt, mit dem Rang und den Vorrechten eines Bürgermeisters. Auch in den kurzlebigen politischen Strukturen, mit denen Frankreich versuchte die Reste seines Kolonialreichs zusammenhalten, übernahm er hohe Ämter. Am 29. April 1959 wurde er zu einem Vertreter Nigers im Senat der Communauté franco-africaine ernannt. Hama wurde zum Ersten Vizepräsidenten des Senats gewählt und war Mitglied der Kommission für Verträge, internationale Abkommen und gemeinsame Verteidigung. Er nahm an der Wahl von Charles de Gaulle zum Präsidenten der Communauté franco-africaine teil. Zudem war er Vizepräsident und Mitglied der ständigen Kommission der ersten Konferenz der Eurafrikanischen Versammlung. Der PPN-RDA führte die Republik Niger durch einen Vertrag mit Frankreich vom 1. August 1960 geordnet in die Unabhängigkeit. Das Parlament wählt Hamani Diori am 9. November 1960 zum Staatspräsidenten. Als Führungspersönlichkeit im unabhängigen Niger Als Niger von Frankreich unabhängig wurde, hatte Boubou Hama seine Rolle als überragende und einflussreiche politische Persönlichkeit seines Landes gefestigt. Die Erste Republik (1960–1974) war ein ziviles autoritäres Regime unter der Führung eines „Duumvirats“ bestehend aus dem Staatspräsidenten Hamani Diori und dem Parteivorsitzenden und Parlamentspräsidenten Boubou Hama. Hama agierte politisch direkter und kompromissloser als der um zehn Jahre jüngere Diori, der diplomatischer auftrat. In den 1960er Jahren war das Regime noch relativ gefestigt. Der Ausbau der in der Kolonialzeit kaum entwickelten Infrastruktur des Landes, etwa im Bildungsbereich, war eine der vorrangigen Aufgaben der jungen Republik. Die staatlich beeinflusste Wirtschaft konnte auf wachsenden Exportzahlen bei Erdnüssen aufbauen. Außenpolitisch lehnte sich Niger stark an Frankreich an. Hamas politische Macht manifestierte sich eher in seinen Führungsfunktionen in diversen anderen staatlichen Institutionen und Komitees als in seiner Rolle als Parlamentspräsident. Die Nationalversammlung besaß keine realpolitische Entscheidungsgewalt. Ein Parlamentssitz bedeutete wenig mehr als eine Anerkennung für verdiente Parteifunktionäre, darunter vor allem traditionelle Herrscher. Eine Funktion der Nationalversammlung lag darin, Boubou Hama eine Tribüne zu bieten. Wirtschaftspolitische Akzente konnte Hama als Präsident des Verwaltungsrats der staatlichen Entwicklungsbank setzen. Die einzige staatlich kontrollierte Bank des Landes war ein wichtiges Instrument, wirtschaftliche Aktivitäten in besonders unterentwickelten Gebieten anzuregen. Dazu gehörte der von Songhai und Zarma besiedelte Westen und der Norden, in dem Araber und Tuareg lebten. Hama war zudem unter anderem Mitglied der beratenden Komitees für landwirtschaftliche Produktion und für höhere Erziehung. Zu seinem ausgeprägten politischen Netzwerk gehörte eine langjährige strategische Verbindung zu Jacques Foccart, dem wichtigsten Akteur der französischen Afrika-Politik. Ein bleibendes Hemmnis war seine niedrige soziale Herkunft. 1963 wurden die Vorbereitungen zu einem Putsch niedergeschlagen, dessen Anführer, ein Offizier, keine Befehle einer Staatsführung entgegennehmen wollte, die von einem Mann mit Sklavenherkunft gelenkt wurde. Neben seiner politischen Tätigkeit festigte Boubou Hama seine Rolle als führender Intellektueller des Landes. Allein zwischen 1966 und 1974 schrieb er über dreißig Bücher. Er war die treibende Kraft bei der Schaffung des vallée de la culture, des „Tals der Kultur“ in Niamey. Dieses Areal umfasst die Gebäude des Nigrischen Nationalmuseums, des Institut de Recherche en Sciences Humaines (IRSH), des Centre Culturel Franco-Nigérien und des Centre d’Études Linguistiques et Historiques par la Tradition Orale (CELHTO). Der Sitz des westafrikanischen Forschungszentrums CELHTO in Niamey – auf Grundlage eines Abkommens mit der UNESCO im Jahr 1968 – fußt auf Hamas vorangegangenen diplomatischen Bemühungen. Boubou Hama gilt auch als ein Gründungsvater der internationalen Organisation der Frankophonie. Als Hausherr der Nationalversammlung war er 1970 Gastgeber eines internationalen Frankophonie-Kongresses in Niamey. Der Jahrestag der Unterzeichnung der Schlussakte des Kongresses, der 20. März, wird seit 1988 als Internationaler Tag der Frankophonie begangen. Der oft impulsiv auftretende Boubou Hama gehörte mit Innenminister Yansambou Maïga Diamballa zu den Hardlinern des Regimes und zu den Hauptfeindbildern von dessen Gegnern. Die Gegensätze zwischen der neuen Schicht der gebildeten Jugendlichen und der Staatsführung verstärkten sich in den 1970er Jahren. Boubou Hama war bei dieser Jugend besonders unpopulär. Auf Streiks von Schülern in Zinder und Niamey für höhere Stipendien, kürzere Ausbildungszeiten und die diplomatische Anerkennung der Sowjetunion und der Volksrepublik China antwortete er 1970 mit einem offenen Brief, in dem er sie bevormundend mit „meine Kinder“ ansprach und sie daran erinnerte, dass sie im Land Privilegien genießen würden. Das zunehmend verkrustete und korrupte Regime war hilflos gegenüber der beginnenden Katastrophe der Hungersnot der 1970er Jahre. Zugleich verloren Erdnüsse, die Basis der Exportwirtschaft, dramatisch an Marktwert. Diese Entwicklungen bereiteten den Boden für das Ende der Ersten Republik. Gefangenschaft und letzte Jahre Ein Militärputsch am 15. April 1974 brachte den Obersten Militärrat unter der Führung des Offiziers Seyni Kountché an die Macht. Die bisherigen politischen Strukturen des Landes wurden aufgelöst und die gesamte politische Elite des Landes verhaftet. Boubou Hama wurde zunächst in der Villa des Conseil de l’Entente in Niamey unter Hausarrest gestellt. Ihm wurden die Veruntreuung staatlicher Gelder in der Höhe von umgerechnet etwa 116.000 US-Dollar und Steuerhinterziehung in der Höhe von 8000 US-Dollar vorgeworfen. Am 29. April 1974 wurde er in das Militärlager von Agadez verlegt. Der korpulente Mann verlor aufgrund der schlechten Haftbedingungen innerhalb von vier Monaten dreißig Kilogramm Körpergewicht. Seine Lage besserte sich, als er am 3. August 1975 auf Anweisung von Seyni Kountché in eine Villa im Militärlager Bagagi-Iya in Niamey überstellt wurde. Dieses Privileg teilte er mit Léopold Kaziendé, Kountchés ehemaligem Lehrer, der vor dem Militärputsch Verteidigungsminister gewesen war. Hama und Kaziendé durften in ihrer Villa regelmäßig ihre Familien empfangen. Am 24. Juli 1977 wurde Boubou Hama freigelassen und konnte in seine Wohnung in Niamey zurückkehren. Als offizielle Begründung für seine Freilassung wurden in der staatlichen Tageszeitung Le Sahel humanitäre Gründe infolge des fortgeschrittenen Alters des Gefangenen sowie sein Beitrag zur kulturellen Entfaltung Afrikas genannt. Hama konzentrierte sich in seinen letzten Jahren auf seine wissenschaftliche Arbeit. Er beteiligte sich 1977 an einem Kolloquium und 1981 an einem Seminar. Noch in den Wochen vor seinem Tod beschäftigte er mit dem Verfassen von Forschungsarbeiten. Boubou Hama starb 1982 in Niamey, wo er auch bestattet wurde. |
G;|Mao Asada (jap. 浅田 真央, Asada Mao; * 25. September 1990 in Nagoya) ist eine japanische Eiskunstläuferin, die im Einzellauf startet. Sie ist die Weltmeisterin von 2008, 2010 und 2014. Mao Asada galt als „Wunderkind“ im Eiskunstlaufen. Mit 12 Jahren versuchte sie das erste Mal bei den Japanischen Meisterschaften einen dreifachen Axel. Asada ist außerdem die erste und bisher einzige Frau, die zwei dreifache Axel im selben Programm bei einem ISU-Wettbewerb gestanden hat. Sie erreichte dies bem 2008–2009 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Finale. Sie hat bereits drei Grand-Prix-Finale gewonnen. An den Olympischen Winterspielen 2006 in Turin durfte sie nicht teilnehmen, weil sie mit 14 Jahren am entscheidenden Stichtag zu jung war. 2007 errang Asada bei den Weltmeisterschaften im eigenen Land die Silbermedaille hinter ihrer Mannschaftskollegin Miki Andō. Die bisher erfolgreichste Saison absolvierte sie im Winter 2007/08, als sie die Trophée Eric Bompard gewann und bei den Vier-Kontinente-Meisterschaften und bei Skate Canada jeweils den ersten Platz belegte. Wenig später konnte Asada auch die Welttitelkämpfe im schwedischen Göteborg für sich entscheiden, als sie durch ihre Kürleistung die nach dem Kurzprogramm führende italienische Europameisterin Carolina Kostner auf Platz zwei verwies. Ähnlich erfolgreich war sie auch 2009/10, als sie ebenfalls Vier-Kontinente-Meisterin und Weltmeisterin wurde sowie hinter Kim Yu-na die Silbermedaille bei den Olympischen Winterspielen holte. Asada ist sechsfache japanische Meisterin (2006–2009, 2011–2012). Ihre Schwester Mai ist ebenfalls Eiskunstläuferin, die bei Juniorenweltmeisterschaften zwei Mal den vierten Rang belegen konnte.   Saison 2005/2006 Nachdem sie schon im Juniorenbereich sehr erfolgreich war, wechselte Asada in der Saison 2006–2006 zu den Senioren und nahm an der Grand Prix-Serie teil. Diese Entscheidung wurde getroffen, obwohl feststand, dass Asada nicht berechtigt war an den Olympischen Winterspielen 2006 teilzunehmen, da sich die Altersbegrenzungen der Olympischen Spiele und anderer ISU Wettbewerbe von denen des Grand Prix unterschieden. Asada trat innerhalb der Grand Prix-Serie das erste Mal im November 2005 beim Cup of China an. Sie gewann Silber und platzierte sich genau 3 Punkte vor der späteren Olympiasiegerin Shizuka Arakawa. Mao Asada gewann ihren zweiten Auftritt, die Trophée Eric Bompard, mit einer Differenz von 7.30 Punkten vor Sasha Cohen. Mit einer Gold- und einer Silbermedaille qualifizierte sie sich für das Grand Prix Finale 2005–2006. Sie gewann diese Veranstaltung mit einem Vorsprung von 8.14 Punkten auf die zuvor zwei Jahre lang ungeschlagenen Irina Sluzkaja. Bei den Japanischen Meisterschaften gewann Asada die Silbermedaille hinter Fumie Suguri. Bei diesem Wettbewerb wurde Asada die erste Frau, die zwei dreifache Axel in einer Kür stand. Sie wurde nicht zu den Olympischen Spielen gesandt, weil sie noch nicht alt genug war. Stattdessen nahm sie an den Junioren Weltmeisterschaften 2006 teil, wo sie als Titelverteidigerin gegen die Siegerin des Junioren Grand Prix Finales Kim Yu-na antrat. Asada wurde Zweite bei dieser Veranstaltung, 24.19 Punkte hinter Kim und 18.21 Punkte vor Christine Zukowski. Dort stand sie als erste Frau einen dreifachen Axel im Kurzprogramm bei einem Wettbewerb der ISU. Während ihrer ersten zwei Jahre in der internationalen Szene wurde Asada berühmt für ihre über Kreuz gegriffene Biellmann-Pirouette. Saison 2006/2007 Asada war, wie auch ihre Rivalin, am Grand Prix Zirkel 2006–2007 angemeldet. Bei ihrem ersten Auftritt, dem Skate America 2006, gewann Asada die Bronzemedaille hinter Miki Andō und Kimmie Meissner. Asada gewann zwar das Kurzprogramm, wurde aber nur Vierte in der Kür. Asada gewann ihre zweite Veranstaltung, die NHK Trophy 2006 mit einer Führung von 20.21 vor Fumie Suguri. Bei diesem Event stellte Asada einen neuen Weltrekord für die höchste Endpunktzahl in den Damenwettbewerben auf. So qualifizierte sich Asada für das Grand Prix Finale. Sie wurde Zweite hinter Kim Yu-na mit einem Abstand von 11.68 Punkten. Asada gewann wieder das Kurzprogramm, aber wie beim Skate America wurde sie in der Kür nur Vierte. Asada gewann die Japanischen Meisterschaften 2006–2007 mit einer Führung von 26.11 Punkten vor Miki Andō und 32.04 vor Yukari Nakano. Bei den Weltmeisterschaften 2007 war Asada Fünftplatzierte im Kurzprogramm, 10.30 hinter Kim Yu-na, die die Führung nach dem Kurzprogramm übernahm. Asada siegte aber in der Kür mit einer Punktzahl von 133.13 Punkten und stellte damit einen neuen Weltrekord für die höchste Punktzahl in der Kür auf. Dieser Rekord sollte für acht Monate bestehen bleiben. Am Ende gewann sie die Silbermedaille mit einer Punktzahl von 194.95, 0.64 hinter der neuen Weltmeisterin Miki Andō und 8.31 Punkte vor der Drittplatzierten Kim Yu-na. Saison 2007/2008 In der Saison 2007–2008 trat Mao Asada zum ersten Mal beim Skate Canada an. Dort gewann sie die Veranstaltung vor Nakano, nachdem sie ein nur drittplatziertes Kurzprogramm gelaufen war. Doch sie siegte in der Kür. Asada gewann auch ihren zweiten Grand Prix, die Trophée Bompard 2007. So qualifizierte sie sich für das Grand Prix Finale. Im Kurzprogramm, sprang sie einen Pflichtsprung wegen leichter Unsicherheiten in dem Schritt davor nicht und bekam somit eine Punktzahl von lediglich 59.04 und wurde letzte. Aber sie siegte abermals in der Kür und gewann letztendlich Silber hinter Kim Yu-na, die ihren Titel verteidigte. Trotz des großen Fehlers im Kurzprogramm war Asada nur 5.24 Punkte vom Sieg entfernt und 12.66 Punkte vor Bronzemedaillistin Carolina Kostner. Wie im vorherigen Jahr gewann Asada die Japanischen Meisterschaften mit einem kleinen Vorsprung vor der Zweitplatzierten Miki Andō. In diesem Jahr nahm Asada das erste Mal an den Vier-Kontinente-Meisterschaften teil. Asada gewann beides, Kür und Kurzprogramm und beendete den Wettbewerb mit einem Vorsprung von 13.71 Punkten auf die Zweitplatzierten Joannie Rochette. Vor dieser Veranstaltung verließ Asada ihren Trainer und nahm an den Weltmeisterschaften ohne Trainer teil. Am 20. März 2008 gewann Mao Asada die Weltmeisterschaften, obwohl sie in beiden Programmen nur zweite war. Im Kurzprogramm war sie mit 64.10 Punkten nur 0.18 Punkte hinter Carolina Kostner. In der Kür stürzte sie zu Beginn bei ihrem Dreifachaxelversuch. Doch sie gab ein grandioses Comeback und stand zwei dreifach-dreifach Kombinationen. So erhielt sie 121.26 Punkte für ihre Kür und 185.56 Punkte in der Gesamtwertung. Saison 2008/2009 Im Grand Prix 2008–2009 nahm Asada an der Trophée Eric Bompard 2008 und an der NHK Trophy 2008 teil. In Paris gewann sie Silber mit einer Gesamtpunktzahl von 167.59 Punkten, 12.54 Punkte hinter Joannie Rochette. Doch Asada gewann ihren zweiten Grand Prix mit 191.13 Punkten und qualifizierte sich damit für das Grand Prix Finale. Beim Grand Prix Finale wurde Asada zweite im Kurzprogramm mit einer Punktzahl von 65.39 Punkten, mit 0.56 Punkten hinter Kim Yu-na. Mit 123.17 Punkten gewann sie die Kür und das gesamte Event. Dabei schrieb sie Geschichte, indem sie zwei dreifache Axel (einer in Kombination mit einem doppelten Toeloop) als erste Frau in einem internationalen Wettbewerb stand. Asada kam als Titelverteidigerin zu den Vier-Kontinente-Meisterschaften nach Vancouver. Dennoch lief sie ein nur sechstplatziertes Kurzprogramm mit 57.86 Punkten, im Vergleich zur führenden Kim Yu-na mit 72.24 Punkten. Aber Mao Asada fand sich wieder in den Wettbewerb mit 118.66 Punkten in ihrer Kür. Ihr erster Versuch eines dreifachen Axels riss sie zu einem einfachen auf, aber sie stand den zweiten erfolgreich und verdiente sich damit 8.80 Punkte. Sie gewann Bronze in der Gesamtwertung hinter Joannie Rochette und Kim Yu-na. Eine ähnliche Situation ergab sich bei den Weltmeisterschaften in Los Angeles. Miki Andō wurde Dritte, Joannie Rochette Zweite und Kim Yu-na gewann ihren ersten Weltmeistertitel. Auf dem vierten Platz mit einer Gesamtpunktzahl von 188.09 fand man Asada wieder, die bei ihrem zweiten dreifachen Axel gestürzt war. Dies war die erste Platzierung neben dem Podium in ihrer internationalen Karriere für Mao Asada. Am Ende der Saison nahm Asada an der Worlds Team Trophy 2009 teil. Im Kurzprogramm bekam sie 75.84 Punkte, eine neue persönliche Bestleistung und führte im Damenwettbewerb. Sie gewann auch die Kür mit 126.03 Punkten und beendete diese Veranstaltung mit einem Sieg und 201.87 Punkten, ebenfalls eine neue persönliche Bestleistung. Das japanische Team gewann Bronze hinter den USA und Kanada. Saison 2009/2010 Im Grand Prix war Mao Asada für die Trophée Eric Bompard 2009 und den Cup of Russia (Rostelecom Cup) 2009 angemeldet. Ihr Saisonauftakt bei den Grand Prix-Wettbewerben war schwach. In Paris landete sie auf Platz zwei, 36.04 Punkte hinter der Koreanerin Kim Yu-na. Beim Cup of Russia erreichte sie lediglich den fünften Rang, nachdem sie nur zwei Dreifachsprünge in der Kür gestanden hatte. In beiden Wettbewerben versuchte sie jeweils drei Dreifach-Axel zu springen (einen im Kurzprogramm, zwei in der Kür), doch von den insgesamt sechs Versuchen war nur einer erfolgreich. Mit diesen Platzierungen war sie nicht in der Lage, sich für das Grand Prix-Finale zu qualifizieren. Nun hatte sie zwei ganze Monate Zeit, sich zu regenerieren und sich voll und ganz auf das Training zu konzentrieren. In der Presse wurde das Duo Tarasova und Asada stark kritisiert. Bei den japanischen Meisterschaften, wo es für sie um die Qualifikation für die Olympischen Spiele 2010 ging, gab sie ein großartiges Comeback. Sie lieferte zwei fehlerfreie Programme ab und erlangte schließlich 204.62 Punkte, trotz Abwertungen, weil sie einige ihrer Sprünge nicht vollständig gedreht hatte. Mit dem Sieg über Akiko Suzuki stand fest, dass sie ein Mitglied des Olympia-Teams sein würde. Die beiden andere Olympia-Startplätze erhielten Miki Andō und Akiko Suzuki. Ihre gute Form konnte Mao Asada auch durch den erneuten Gewinn der Vier-Kontinente-Meisterschaft bestätigen. Bei den Olympischen Spielen in Vancouver errang sie hinter Kim Yu-na die Silbermedaille mit insgesamt drei sauberen Dreifach-Axeln in Kurzprogramm und Kür, und erreichte damit einen weiteren Weltrekord. Bei den Weltmeisterschaften in Turin holte sie Gold, nachdem sie im Kurzprogramm auf Platz zwei hinter der Amerikanerin Mirai Nagasu gelegen hatte. Sie lief beide Programme fehlerfrei, doch im Nachhinein wurden zwei ihrer dreifachen Axel (einer im Kurzprogramm, einer in der Kür) auf einen doppelten herunter gewertet, da sie nicht vollständig rotiert waren. Daher kam auch die vergleichsweise niedrige Punktzahl in der Kürwertung mit 129.50 Punkten. Kim Yu-na erreichte den zweiten Rang und Laura Lepistö aus Finnland landete auf Platz drei. Saison 2010/2011 In dem Grand-Prix 2010–2011 war Mao Asada für die Trophée Eric Bompard 2010 und die NHK Trophy 2010 gemeldet. Bei der NHK Trophy 2010 platzierte sich Asada nach dem Kurzprogramm auf dem achten Rang mit 47.95 Punkten. Sie machte Fehler bei allen drei Sprungelementen. Sie landete auf vorwärts bei ihrem dreifachen Axel, sprang ihren Flip nur einfach und der dreifache Rittberger in ihrer Kombination mit einem doppelten Rittberger wurde wegen fehlender Rotation abgewertet. Auch in der Kür machte Mao Asada Fehler bei fünf ihrer sieben Sprungelemente. Sie stand lediglich einen dreifachen Salchow und einen dreifachen Rittberger; so lief sie auch nur die achte Kür mit 85.45 Punkten und belegte in der Gesamtwertung mit 133.40 Punkten ebenfalls den achten Rang. Im September 2010 erklärte Asada Nobuo Satō zu ihrem neuen Trainer, nachdem sie sich nach den Weltmeisterschaften 2010 von Tatjana Tarassowa getrennt hatte. Außerdem arbeitete Asada seit August 2010 daran, ihre Sprungtechnik umzustellen, um in Zukunft mehr Zusatzpunkte zu dem Basiswert eines Sprungs erhalten kann. Diese Umstellung einer jahrelang eingeübten Technik ist ein mühsamer Prozess, der ein bis zwei Jahre andauern kann und wobei die Sprünge bis zur Vollendung häufig instabil und oft nur im Training zu stehen sind. Das erklärt auch Asadas vergleichsweise schlechte Leistung in der Grand-Prix-Serie. Bei den japanischen Meisterschaften wie auch bei der Vier-Kontinente-Meisterschaft gewann sie die Silbermedaille hinter Miki Andō. Saison 2011/2012 Asada qualifizierte sich mit einem Sieg beim Cup of Russia und einem zweiten Platz bei der NHK Trophy erstmals nach drei Jahren für das Grand-Prix-Finale. Sie zog ihre Meldung jedoch kurzfristig aufgrund der schweren Erkrankung ihrer Mutter zurück. Ihre Mutter starb an Leberzirrhose während Asada sich auf dem Rückflug nach Japan befand. Nur zwei Wochen nach dem Tod ihrer Mutter wurde Asada ein weiteres Mal Japanische Meisterin und belegte später in der Saison bei der Vier-Kontinente-Meisterschaft den zweiten Platz hinter der US-Amerikanerin Ashley Wagner. Die Weltmeisterschaft beendete sie wie im Vorjahr auf dem sechsten Platz. Saison 2012/2013 Asada startete in die Saison mit einem Sieg beim Cup of China, den sie erstmals für sich entscheiden konnte. Sie gewann auch die NHK Trophy. So qualifizierte sie sich souverän für das Grand-Prix-Finale in Sotschi, dass sie ebenfalls unangefochten für sich entschied. Außerdem entschied Asada zum sechsten Mal in ihrer Karriere die nationalen Meisterschaften für sich und qualifizierte sich so für die Vier-Kontinente-Meisterschaften und die Weltmeisterschaften. Mao Asada führte ihre Siegesserie fort, indem sie bei den Vier-Kontinente-Meisterschaften mit rund 15 Punkten Vorsprung vor ihrer Landsfrau Akiko Suzuki siegte. Im Kurzprogramm zeigte sie nach längerer Zeit wieder einen perfekten Dreifachen Axel und wurde mit einer Punktzahl von 74.49 dafür belohnt. Diese Wertung war die höchste Wertung für ein Kurzprogramm der Damen seit den Olympischen Spielen 2010. Asada konnte ihren ersten Platz in der Kür verteidigen, welche sie mit mehr als 6 Punkten für sich entschied. So erreichte sie eine Gesamtpunktzahl von 205.45 Punkten und scheiterte damit nur knapp an ihrer persönlichen Bestleistung. Bei den Weltmeisterschaften 2013 im kanadischen London erreichte Mao Asada den dritten Rang. Sie kam nach einem enttäuschenden Kurzprogramm, in dem sie den dreifach geplanten Rittberger nur einfach sprang und danach mit 62.10 Punkten lediglich auf dem sechsten Platz lag, mit der zweitbesten Kür (134.37 Punkte) und einer neuen persönlichen Bestleistung zurück. Mit insgesamt 196.47 Punkten landete sie hinter Kim Yu-na und Carolina Kostner erstmals seit 2010 wieder auf dem Podium bei Weltmeisterschaften. Saison 2013/2014 Mao Asada plant nach den Olympischen Spielen 2014 in Sotschi vom Profisport zurückzutreten. Für Asada begann die Grand Prix Saison 2013 in Detroit beim Skate America 2013. Dort erzielte sie 204.55 Punkte in der Gesamtwertung, was ihr auch den Sieg einbrachte. Die hohe Punktzahl setzte sich aus dem nahezu fehlerfreien Kurzprogramm mit 73.18 Punkten und einer soliden Kürleistung mit 131.37 Punkten zusammen. Mit dem Sieg beim Skate America ist Mao Asada nun die erste Einzelläuferin, männlich oder weiblich, die in ihrer Karriere alle sechs Grands Prix sowie das Grand Prix Finale für sich entscheiden konnte. Bei den Olympischen Spielen 2014 lag sie nach einem verpatzten Kurzprogramm auf einem für ihre Verhältnisse desaströsen 16. Rang. Mit der drittbesten Kür konnte sie sich noch auf den sechsten Gesamtrang verbessern. Sie trat nicht zurück, sondern gewann einige Wochen später bei den Weltmeisterschaften in ihrem Heimatland Japan in Saitama verdient und deutlich zum dritten Mal den Weltmeistertitel. |
G;|Josef Zeitler (* 24. September 1871 in Fürth; † 24. März 1958 in Stuttgart) war ein deutscher Bildhauer in Stuttgart, der vor allem durch die bildhauerische Ausschmückung von Bauwerken in Stuttgart und Württemberg bekannt wurde. Nach seiner Schulzeit in Fürth und einer vierjährigen Lehrzeit als Bildhauer und Schreiner in Gütersloh begab sich Josef Zeitler neun Jahre lang „auf die Walz“ quer durch Deutschland und Europa. 1897 ließ er sich in Stuttgart nieder, wo er vor allem als Architekturbildhauer mit volkstümlichen, oft humorvollen und genrehaften Kleinplastiken, aber auch mit Arbeiten für Kirchen bis zum Zweiten Weltkrieg sehr erfolgreich war. Von 1923 bis 1937 wirkte er als Professor an der Höheren Bauschule in Stuttgart. Nach dem Krieg schuf der bejahrte Künstler nur noch wenige Werke.  Über Zeitlers Leben gibt es keine zusammenfassende Darstellung, sondern nur versprengte Anmerkungen in Zeitungsartikeln und Zeitschriftenaufsätzen. 1941 plante Zeitler eine „Selbstbiographie, die er zu seinem 70. Geburtstag als Rückschau und Rechenschaft über ein tätig bewegtes Künstlerleben veröffentlichen“ wollte. Es ist nicht bekannt, ob Zeitler diese Autobiographie geschrieben hat, desgleichen ist auch nichts bekannt über den Verbleib seines Nachlasses. Kindheit Josef Zeitler wurde am 24. September 1871 im fränkischen Fürth in der Heiligen Gasse (heute Heiligenstraße) geboren, später wohnte die Familie hauptsächlich in der Schützenstraße (heute Wilhelm-Löhe-Straße). Von seiner Geburt erzählte Zeitler in seiner humorvollen Art: „Mein Vater behauptete, dass ich in einen Maßkrug hineingegangen wäre, so klein war ich und eine lange Lebensdauer hätte mir keiner versprochen.“ Josefs Vater war der Schreinermeister A. P. Zeitler, der seinen Sohn schon früh „zu strenger beruflicher Mitarbeit“ anhielt. Das Hauptgeschäft des Vaters bestand in der Anfertigung kunstvoller Schmuckkästchen. Zeitler besuchte bis zu seinem 13. Lebensjahr die Volksschule. Seine Mutter (1840–1880), die erste Frau seines Vaters, war „eine fromme und kunstliebende Frau“, die aus ihrem Sohn gern einen Maler gemacht hätte. Seine Lieblingsfächer waren Zeichnen, Singen, Turnen und Geographie. Ein Verwandter seiner Mutter, Vetter Kriegbaum, ein Maler und Fotograf, erteilte ihm ab seinem sechsten Lebensjahr Zeichenunterricht. Später äußerte Zeitler über ihn: „Dieser Mann mit seinem vornehmen Wesen hatte den größten Einfluß auf meine ganze Kindheit.“ Mit neun Jahren eröffnete der kleine Zeitler eine Zeichenschule für Kinder, in der „meistens … Jumpos (Elefanten) gezeichnet“ wurden. In der kargen Freizeit, die zum Spielen übrigblieb, beschäftigte er sich am liebsten mit Zirkusspielen, Kasperletheater und Theaterspielen. Die zweite Frau seines Vaters war die jüngere Tochter von Theodor von Muncker, der von 1863 bis zu seinem Tod 1900 Bürgermeister von Bayreuth war und maßgeblich die Realisierung von Richard Wagners Festspielidee in Bayreuth vorantrieb. Durch seine Stiefmutter kam Zeitler des öftern nach Bayreuth. „Der Vater dieser zweiten Frau war mit Richard Wagner eng befreundet und so kam ich fast täglich in das Haus »Wahnfried« und wurde Siegfrieds guter Freund und Spielkamerad.“ Lehrzeit Nach Beendigung der Schulzeit wurde Zeitler um 1884 mit dreizehn Jahren nach Gütersloh in Westfalen zu seinem Onkel Johann Zeitler in die Lehre geschickt, der eine gutgehende Werkstätte für Christliche Kunst betrieb. „Nach vierjähriger harter, aber auch sehr fruchtbringender Lehrzeit … rückte er bei Nacht und Nebel von dort aus; der junge Geselle, im Bewußtsein seiner Tüchtigkeit als Steinmetz, Bildhauer, Schreiner und Drechsler mochte sich eben nicht länger als Kindermädchen, Hausknecht und Viehfütterer gebrauchen lassen.“ Bei einem Hafnermeister in Aschaffenburg lernte er „in einigen Wochen auch die Technik der Keramik“. München Danach kam er um 1888 für einige Wochen zurück nach Fürth, um nach einem unersprießlichen Intermezzo als Schnitzer von Spiegelrahmen die „Flucht“ nach München anzutreten. Hier setzte der siebzehnjährige Zeitler seine Ausbildung bei dem Bildhauer Josef Flossmann fort und kam auch in Berührung mit den renommierten Architekten Gabriel von Seidl, Emanuel von Seidl, Theodor Fischer, Friedrich von Thiersch, Georg von Hauberrisser und Hans Grässel, durch die er unter anderem auch Arbeit bei der Ausschmückung des Bayerischen Nationalmuseums, des Rathauses, des Justizpalastes und der Kirche St. Anna im Lehel fand. In der bayrischen Hauptstadt arbeitete Zeitler auch in einem Atelier für Christliche Kunst. Dort lernte er den gleichaltrigen Ignatius Taschner kennen, der von 1889 bis 1895 an der Akademie der Bildenden Künste studierte. Taschner war ein lebenslustiger Franke wie Zeitler, und beide waren in vielerlei Hinsicht einander geistesverwandt. Beide arbeiteten in den verschiedensten Materialien, beide liebten das Kleinplastische und die volkstümlichen Genre- und Märchenmotive. Von Sebastian Kneipp erhielten sie den Auftrag, einen Altar für Bad Wörishofen zu schaffen, für beide der erste größere Auftrag. Während Zeitler auch später in seinem Kunststil der Tradition verhaftet blieb, entwickelte sich der vielseitige Taschner zum Jugendstil hin, ohne seine Neigung für volkstümliche Kunst aufzugeben. Wanderjahre Es ist nicht bekannt, wann Zeitler München verließ, jedenfalls begann er anschließend seine Wanderjahre, die ihn „ohne jegliche Barmittel als fahrender Geselle“ zu Fuß quer durch Deutschland und nach Italien, Frankreich, Holland, Belgien, Schweiz, Österreich, Ungarn, Dalmatien, England, Dänemark und Schweden führten. Unterwegs verdingte er sich als Bildhauer, um seinen Lebensunterhalt zu bestreiten und sich in seinem Beruf zu vervollkommnen. Im Zusammenhang mit der Arbeit an der Innenausstattung des Berliner Stadtschlosses hielt er sich zu Studienzwecken ein Jahr lang in Paris auf, um im Auftrag von Kaiser Wilhelm II. ein Zimmer in Schloss Fontainebleau zu kopieren. In Paris besuchte er die Académie Julian und traf den berühmten Bildhauer Auguste Rodin, der ihn „zu seinen beiden ersten Arbeiten: figürliche Holzschnitzereien, denen eine intime humoristische Note eignete“ beglückwünschte. In Brüssel arbeitete er an der künstlerischen Ausschmückung von Joseph Poelaerts Justizpalast mit und in Lüttich an der Ausgestaltung der Rathaustreppe. Auch in Deutschland arbeitete Zeitler an der Ausschmückung vieler Gebäude in vielen Städten mit, unter anderem in Berlin, wo er unter den Architekten Paul Wallot, Alfred Messel und Ludwig Hoffmann am Reichstagsgebäude und an der Staatsbibliothek sowie an der Innenausstattung des Berliner Stadtschlosses mitarbeitete. Seine Arbeit in Berlin trug ihm eine Essenseinladung ein, bei der er neben Bismarck saß, der anerkennend bemerkte: „Nun, Sie kleiner Mann haben schon Großes geleistet“. Des Weiteren war er am Hamburger Rathaus beschäftigt, an den Synagogen in Mainz und Frankfurt am Main, in den Städten Köln und Münster sowie an einer von Heinrich Jassoy erbauten Kirche in Düsseldorf. Jassoy, der auch das Stuttgarter Rathaus erbaute, empfahl ihn nach Stuttgart, wo er zusammen mit 140 anderen Bildhauern mit Arbeiten für das neue Rathaus betraut wurde. Er schuf unter anderem 14 Reliefs, die heute im Depot des Stadtarchivs aufbewahrt werden und dem Anblick des Publikums entzogen sind. Auf seinen Reisen lernte er wohl auch seine erste Frau kennen, die ihm zwei Töchter gebar, die ältere wurde 1893 in Köln geboren und die jüngere 1895 in Düsseldorf. Im gleichen Jahr weilte Zeitler vorübergehend in Stuttgart, wo er den Bildhauerschmuck des Hauses Mörikestraße 21 schuf. 1932 zog Zeitler die Summe seiner Wanderjahre: Nachdem er sich nach München begeben hatte, begann „ein Leben voller Entbehrungen, Enttäuschungen aber auch voll reicher Erfolge. Meinem Vater kostete ich vom 14. Lebensjahr an keinen Pfennig mehr, denn ich habe weder eine Kunstakademie noch eine Kunstschule besucht, dafür jedoch bei unseren bekanntesten Meistern in deren Atelier des In- und Auslandes gearbeitet und an Bauten von Bedeutung mitgeschafft, auch alle Länder Europas bereist und sehr viel gesehen und gelernt.“ Stuttgart 1897 ließ sich Zeitler mit seiner Familie in Stuttgart nieder, wo er die ersten drei Jahre in der Alexanderstraße 170 wohnte. Bis zu seiner Evakuierung im Zweiten Weltkrieg lebte er mit seiner Familie in verschiedenen Mietwohnungen in der Innenstadt (Heusteigstraße 103, Seestraße 97, 102, 32, Jägerstraße 34, Alleenstraße 36). 1903 mietete er ein Atelier in der Roten Straße 7 (heute Theodor-Heuss-Straße), später in der Marienstraße 9, von 1911 bis 1927 drei Stockwerke im Haus Marienstraße 48a, wo auch seine Hilfsbildhauer unterkamen, die er zur Bewältigung seiner vielen Aufträge anstellte. Seit 1928 bis zu seiner Emeritierung unterhielt er ein Atelier an der Höheren Bauschule und von 1941–1943 und nach dem Krieg in der Weißenburgstraße 35. In den ersten Jahren ließ sich Zeitler im Adressbuch als Modelleur eintragen, später als Bildhauer, dann als Kunstbildhauermeister. In Stuttgart wurde Zeitler „mit Aufträgen überhäuft“. Ab 1901 bis weit in die zwanziger Jahre wurde er oftmals mit der bildhauerischen Ausstattung von Kirchen und öffentlichen Bauwerken in Stuttgart, aber auch anderswo in Württemberg betraut (Elisabethenkirche, St. Fideliskirche, Heilandskirche, Schlachthof, Hans-Sachs-Haus, Heusteigschule, Graf-Eberhard-Bau, Salamanderbau, Markthalle, Rathaus, Kunstgebäude, Hans-im-Glück-Brunnen, Waldfriedhof, Hauptfriedhof). Bei der Stuttgarter Altstadtsanierung 1906–1909 lieferte er den Bildhauerschmuck für sämtliche neuerbauten Gebäude. Er arbeitete mit allen namhaften Architekten zusammen, unter anderem mit Theodor Fischer, Karl Hengerer, Paul Bonatz, Paul Schmohl, Albert Eitel, Martin Elsaesser, Albert Pantle und Clemens Hummel. Lehrtätigkeit Bereits vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg hatte Zeitler Rufe an Kunstgewerbeschulen in Köln und Berlin erhalten, die er jedoch auch auf Drängen einflussreicher Persönlichkeiten ablehnte. Am 1. Juli 1923 oder schon 1922 wurde Zeitler als Professor an die Staatliche Höhere Bauschule in Stuttgart berufen, die im historischen Egle-Bau in der Schellingstraße 24 residierte, dem Bau 1 der heutigen Hochschule für Technik, der Nachfolgerin der Bauschule. Er unterrichtete an der Schule 15 Jahre lang in den Fächern Freihandzeichnen und Modellieren sowie im perspektivischen Zeichnen. Entsprechend dem Auftrag der Schule, eine praktische Ausbildung in den Bauberufen zu bieten, zog Zeitler durch seinen praxisbezogenen Unterricht den „Nachwuchs junger Architekturbildhauer zu besten Kunsthandwerkern heran“. Ab 1928 unterhielt Zeitler auch sein Atelier in der Bauschule. Im Frühjahr 1937 wurde Zeitler wegen Erreichung der Altersgrenze von seinen Pflichten entbunden. Zweiter Weltkrieg Zeitler war bei Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkriegs 68 Jahre alt. Während des Kriegs, spätestens 1943, evakuierte Zeitler mit seiner Frau nach Kiefersfelden in Oberbayern, wo er bei dem Stuttgarter Bildhauer Emil Hipp unterkam. Hipp hatte 1933 einen Wettbewerb der Stadt Leipzig für ein monumentales Richard-Wagner-Denkmal gewonnen, das in dem neu anzulegenden Richard-Wagner-Hain errichtet werden sollte. Es ist anzunehmen, dass Zeitler, der in seiner Kindheit mit Siegfried Wagner befreundet war, an der Ausführung des Denkmals mitarbeitete, zumal Hipps Hilfskräfte zum Kriegsdienst eingezogen worden waren. Das Denkmal wurde 1944 fertiggestellt, aber nie aufgestellt. Von Kiefersfelden aus versuchte Zeitler, das Projekt eines Brunnens „Schöne Lau und Stuttgarter Hutzelmännlein“ in Stuttgart unter Dach und Fach zu bringen. Die schriftlichen Verhandlungen zogen sich hin, und nach den verheerenden Luftangriffen 1944 hatte Stuttgart andere Sorgen. Seit sich Zeitler um die Jahrhundertwende in Stuttgart niedergelassen hatte, war er über drei Jahrzehnte bestens mit Aufträgen versorgt (siehe Werkliste). Trotz seines guten Einkommens erwarb Zeitler keinen Immobilienbesitz, sondern legte mit großer Leidenschaft eine kostspielige und wertvolle Kunstsammlung an („eine der bedeutendsten privaten Kunstsammlungen Württembergs“), die auch als Altersvorsorge gedacht war. Der Wert der Sammlung belief sich nach Zeitlers Angaben auf 80.000 Reichsmark, für einige Einzelstücke (Tilman Riemenschneider, Veit Stoß, Syrlin) soll ihm ein amerikanisches Museum sogar eine Million Reichsmark geboten haben. Zeitler übergab 1943 seine Sammlung der Stadt Stuttgart zur Verwahrung in den Salzbergwerken in Kochendorf. Der größere, wertvollere Teil wurde jedoch entgegen der Absprache in Schloss Löwenstein gelagert. Dieses wurde „zwei Tage vor Kriegsschluß in Brand geschossen“, und Zeitlers Kunstsammlung wurde vernichtet. Alter Nach Kriegsende kehrte Zeitler mit seiner Frau nach Stuttgart zurück, wo er bis zu seinem Tod in Degerloch in der Reginenstraße 38 wohnte. Anders als nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg wurde der 74 Jahre alte Zeitler nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg nur noch mit wenigen Aufträgen betraut. Das Haus seiner Frau in der Seestraße 32 war ausgebombt worden, und er erhielt für seine 15-jährige Tätigkeit an der Höheren Bauschule eine Pension von etwa 500 DM, was immerhin etwa dem Anderthalbfachen des Durchschnittseinkommens entsprach. Zeitler empfand die Höhe seines Einkommens als prekär, zumal er auch noch die Miete für sein Atelier in der Weißenburgstraße 35 aufbringen musste. Die einzigen bekannten öffentlichen Aufträge nach dem Krieg waren der Bienenbrunnen (1945) und das Burgbrünnele (1949), beide in Stuttgart-Wangen. Außerdem erhielt Zeitler 1949 von der Stadt den Auftrag, eine Erinnerungsplakette zu entwerfen, die ihm netto 155 DM einbrachte. Zeitler versuchte von 1949 bis 1955 vergeblich, der Stadt seinen Schöne-Lau-Brunnen anzudienen. Diese hielt Zeitlers Kunst für überlebt und glaubte auch, den geforderten hohen Preis nicht erschwingen zu können. Die Idee, ihm einen bescheidenen „Ehrensold“ zu gewähren, wurde abgelehnt, weil sein Einkommen als zu hoch eingeschätzt wurde. Zeitler wies im Schriftverkehr mit der Stadt immer wieder auf den Verlust seiner Kunstsammlung hin, den nach seiner Meinung die Stadt zu vertreten hatte. Die Stadt lehnte es jedoch ab, Zeitler für seine Kriegsverluste zu entschädigen. Daraufhin versuchte Zeitler 1954, auf dem Rechtsweg einen Schadenersatz zu erlangen. Auch dieser Versuch blieb erfolglos. Familie Über Zeitlers erste Frau ist nichts Näheres bekannt. Nach den Geburtsjahren der Töchter zu schließen, fand die Heirat 1893 oder früher statt. 1913 fertigte Zeitler eine Bronzebüste von ihr an, die im Zweiten Weltkrieg zerstört wurde. Aus der ersten Ehe gingen zwei Töchter hervor. Die ältere Tochter Magdalene Giessenhoffer-Zeitler (1893–?) wurde in Köln geboren und wohnte mit ihrem Ehemann, dem Rechtsanwalt Robert Giessenhoffer (1890–?), in Stuttgart. Sie arbeitete vorwiegend als abstrakte Malerin, schuf aber auch ein gegenständiches Fresko zum Leben des heiligen Fidelis von Sigmaringen für die St. Fideliskirche in Stuttgart, für die Zeitler eine Figurengruppe und zwei Friese geschaffen hatte (das Fresko wurde 1944 im Zweiten Weltkrieg zerstört). Die jüngere Tochter Anny Pötzelberger (1895–?) wurde in Düsseldorf geboren und heiratete den Maler Oswald Pötzelberger, mit dem sie in München und nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg auf der Insel Reichenau wohnte. Zeitlers Sohn Paul H. Zeitler lebte in Richmond. Über ihn ist nichts Näheres bekannt. Nach dem Tod seiner ersten Frau heiratete Zeitler die Witwe Emmy Löble geb. Lehrenkrauss (1886–1968), eine Tochter des Stuttgarter Bäckers Adolf Lehrenkrauss. Sie erbte durch ihren verstorbenen Mann nach dem Tod von dessen Eltern um 1935 das Haus Seestraße 32, das im Zweiten Weltkrieg zerstört wurde. Tod In seinen letzten Lebensjahren litt Zeitler unter einem schweren Augenleiden, das fast zur Erblindung führte. Seine letzten Werke waren der Altar für die St. Fideliskirche in Stuttgart, für die er 1925 eine Figurengruppe über dem Hauptportal und zwei Engelsfriese geschaffen hatte, und das Modell einer Figur von „Walter von der Vogelweide“. Josef Zeitler starb am 24. März 1958 im Alter von 87 Jahren. Seine Frau zog aus Degerloch in die Stöckachstraße 23 in Stuttgart-Ost und starb ein Jahrzehnt später 1968 im Alter von 84 Jahren. Beide sind in einem Grab auf dem Stuttgarter Waldfriedhof in Abteilung 10n bestattet (siehe Grabmal). |
G;|Alexander Leehom Wang (chinesisch 王力宏, Pinyin Wáng Lì Hóng; * 17. Mai 1976 in Rochester, New York) ist ein US-amerikanischer Musiker, Musikproduzent, Regisseur und Schauspieler. Während er in Europa erst durch seine Rolle in Ang Lees Gefahr und Begierde bekannt wurde, ist er in China und anderen Teilen Asiens vor allem als Sänger sehr bekannt. Leehom Wang ist in China auch als Werbefigur für zahlreiche Firmen wie COACH, Seiko, Garnier Men, Nikon, SONY Ericsson, McDonald's und Fossil tätig. Wangs Schulausbildung erfolgte an der Eastman School of Music, am Williams College und am Berklee College of Music. Seine Musikrichtung ist dafür bekannt, chinesische Elemente (z.B. Peking Oper, traditionelle Stile der ethischen Minderheiten, sowie klassische Musik) mit Hip-Hop und R&B verschmelzen zu lassen. Leehom Wang begann seine Karriere im Jahre 1995 in Taiwan. Er gewann viermal den Golden Melody Award, den „Grammy“ der taiwanisch-chinesischen Musik. Am 14. April 2012 gastierte Leehom Wangs auf seiner Welttournee mit seinem aktuellen Programm Music Man II – Open Fire im Nationalstadion Peking. Es war das erste Popkonzert eines Solokünstlers, das in diesem Stadion, das für die Olympischen Spiele 2008 errichtet wurde, stattfand.  Bereits als Kind lernte Wang Geige zu spielen; später brachte er sich selbst Klavier, Gitarre, Schlagzeug, Bass, Erhu, Xylophon und andere Instrumente bei. Nicht selten spielt er seine Alben im Alleingang im heimischen Tonstudio ein. Kindheit und Karrierestart (1976–1997) Wang wurde in Rochester (New York), als zweiter von drei Söhnen einer Immigrantenfamilie aus Taiwan mit festlandchinesischen Wurzeln, geboren. Sein Vater, ein Kinderarzt, und seine Mutter zogen für ihr fortführendes Universitätsstudium in den frühen 60er Jahren in die Vereinigten Staaten. Mit seinem älteren Bruder Leo, der seit seinem siebten Lebensjahr Geigenunterricht bekam, als Vorbild, entwickelte Wang selbst schon mit drei Jahren ein großes Interesse an der Geige. Er bat seine Mutter um Geigenstunden mit seinem Bruder, aber seine Mutter war in diesem jungen Alter dagegen. Als Wang sechs Jahre alt wurde, durfte er endlich am Unterricht teilnehmen. Im Teenager-Alter besuchte er seinen ersten Klavier-Unterricht, sowie brachte er sich selbst das Gitarrespielen bei. Des Weiteren verdiente er sich mit verschiedenen Kleinjobs Geld, um sich ein gebrauchtes Schlagzeug zu kaufen. Er besuchte die Jefferson Road Elementary School, Pittsford Middle School und machte seinen Abschluss an der Pittsford Sutherland High School in Pittsford, New York. Aufgrund seiner Leidenschaft zur Musik, schrieb er sich in daraufhin in das Williams College ein, mit den Hauptfächern in Musik und Asienwissenschaften. Er trat einer A cappella-Gruppe, namens The Springstreeters, bei, welche einige Demostücke aufnahm. Im Sommer 1995, während seines Ferienaufenthaltes bei seinen Großeltern in Taiwan, unterschrieb Wang seinen ersten Plattenvertrag mit BMG. Die Plattenfirma war durch einen selbstveranstalteten Talentwettbewerb, an dem Wang aus Lust und Laune teilnahm, aufmerksam geworden. Um sich solch eine Gelegenheit nicht entgehen zu lassen, begann er sofort mit den Vorbereitungen seines Debütalbums Love Rival, Beethoven, welches noch im Dezember auf dem Markt erschien. Das Album wurde kaum beachtet und Wang musste das Label wieder verlassen. Im folgenden Jahr kam er bei Decca Records unter Vertrag. Decca war in zu dieser Zeit in Taiwan bekannt für seine „besonders leistungsstarken Sänger“ (實力派歌手). Das Label plante ursprünglich Wang als „romantisches Mainstream-Idol“ zu vermarkten. Als die Verantwortlichen jedoch Wangs weitumfassendes Musiktalent erkannten, warben sie für ihn stattdessen als „Super-Idol“ (優質偶像). Wang veröffentlichte sein zweites Album If You Heard My Song in der ersten Jahreshälfte 1996, welches auch einige seiner eigenen Kompositionen umfasste. Er war Co-Autor des gleichnamigen Titelliedes, welches positive Reaktionen vom Publikum erhielt. Das Album, so wie auch das folgende dritte und vierte Album, hatte einen mäßigen Erfolg und Wang wurde als „aufgehender Stern“ gefeiert. Während dieser Zeit wurde Wang gebeten, sein Studium abzubrechen, um seine Gesangskarriere vollzeitig ausüben zu können, aber er bestand darauf, seine Studien beenden zu wollen. Während des Semesters studierte und komponierte er zu Hause in den USA; in den Semesterferien stand er im Studio oder promotete seine Musik in Taiwan. Aufstieg (1998–2000) Wangs Vertrag mit Decca Records wurde nach der Veröffentlichung des vierten Albums White Paper im Sommer 1997 beendet. Im selben Sommer schloss er seinen Bachelor-Abschluss mit Auszeichnung am Williams College ab. Im August 1998 veröffentlichte er sein erstes preisgekröntes Album Revolution unter Sony Music Entertainment. Das Album verhalf ihn zum endgültigen Durchbruch und verkaufte über 10.000 Platten in der ersten Woche nach Veröffentlichung. Auch Kritiker lobten das Album in hohen Tönen und Wang wurde mit zwei Golden Melody Awards (dem taiwanischen Grammy) als „Bester Produzent“ sowie „Bester Mandarin-Sänger“ ausgezeichnet. Er war der bis dahin jüngste, in beiden Kategorien ausgezeichnete, Künstler. Wang wird seit dem Erfolg von „Revolution“ jährlich für den „Besten Mandarin Sänger“ nominiert. Die Singleauskopplungen von Revolution erreichten ähnlichen Erfolg: Das Titellied des Albums Revolution wurde Leehom Wangs erste „Nummer 1“ und war in den „Top 20“ der Jahrescharts des Musikkanals Channel V Taiwan. Er setzte sein Master-Studium am Berklee College of Music fort, mit „Gesang als sein Hauptinstrument“. Wangs sechstes Album Impossible to Miss You erschien im Jahre 1999 und kombinierte die eingängingen Pop-Melodien von Revolution mit einem skurrilen Stil des neu-entdeckten Dance-Pops. Es wurde sein bis dato bestverkauftes Album mit über 1 Million Platten. Alle Singleauskopplungen des Albums erreichten höhere Plätze der Karaoke- und jährlichen Musikcharts, insbesondere das peppige Julia und die Ballade Crying Palm (Liu Lei Shou Xin). Nun erreichte Leehom Wang auch internationale Aufmerksamkeit – Wang gewann gleich dreimal den „Besten Sänger“-Preis bei drei verschiedenen Preisverleihungen und wurde ebenfalls für seine musikalischen Verdienste des aktuellen Albums bei den 1. Asia Chinese Music Awards mit einem Preis belohnt. Um die Jahrtausendwende begann Wang die Dreharbeiten zu mehreren kantonesisch-sprachigen Hongkong Blockbustern, welche ihn dazu inspirierten die kantonesische Sprache zu erlernen. Er veröffentlichte auf der Hong-Kong-Version seines siebten Albums Forever’s First Day (2000) das kantonesische Lied Love My Song (Ngoi Nog Dik Goh) als Bonustrack. Anders als seine vorherigen zwei Alben, wandte sich Forever’s First Day hauptsächlich melodischen R&B-Stücken zu. Die gleichnamige Single ist eine tragische, romantische Ballade, die von der Trennung zwei Individuen handelt. Obwohl Wang in New York aufwuchs, spürte er seit dem Umzug nach Taiwan seine chinesischen Wurzeln. Forever’s First Day lieferte aus diesen neu gewonnenen Stolz eine Coverversion von Descendants of the Dragon, das Lied, mit dem bereits einige Jahrzehnte vorher sein Onkel erfolgreich gewesen war. Wang arrangierte das Lied mit stärkeren Rock- und Dance-Elementen komplett neu. Der Song enthielt außerdem eine neue englische Rap-Bridge, die die Erlebnisse seiner Eltern als chinesische Migranten in New York zusammenfasste. Internationaler Erfolg (2001–2003) Wangs nächstes Album The One and Only (2001) erreichte einen phänomenalen internationalen Erfolg. Allein in Asien verkaufte es sich über eine Million Mal und das rock-inspirierte Werk gewann über sieben verschiedene Auszeichnungen in den Jahren 2001 und 2002. Das Titellied The One and Only (Wei Yi) erreichte in fast allen taiwanischen Musikcharts die Spitzenposition und war über ein Jahr die Nummer eins der einheimischen Klingelton-Download Charts, was das Lied zu Leehom Wangs Aushängeschild werden ließ. The One and Only fand auch in Japan seine Anhänger, was Wang dazu ermutigte, seine erste japanische Langspielplatte The Only One am 9. Mai 2003 zu veröffentlichen. Das Album hatte nur eine Single, eine japanische Version von The One and Only, aber es erreichte nicht den erwarteten Erfolg in Japans Oricon Charts. Wang begann währenddessen mehrere japanische Filme zu drehen, welche seine Popularität in Japan ankurbelten. 2003 startete Wang seine erste große Asien-Tournee The Unbelievable Tour, nur wenige Monate vor Veröffentlichung seines neunten Albums Unbelievable. Die Konzerte erhielten sehr gute Rezensionen von Fans und Musikkritikern; man war beeindruckt und zugleich geschockt von seinem neuen Hip-Hop-Image. Sein R&B/Hip Hop-inspiriertes Album Unbelievable beinhaltete neue Nummern mit Hip Hop-Einflüssen von verschiedenen Stilen der Popmusik, wie Indiepop und Urban-Pop. Das Album markiert einen Meilenstein in seiner Musikkarriere; sein neues Image erhielt internationales Kritikerlob und war ein Chartstürmer mit über 1,5 Millionen Einheiten bis 2004. Eine Sonderauflage (celebratory version) des Albums erschien drei Monate später und wurde genauso ein großer Erfolg. Die Singleveröffentlichungen, insbesondere die Ballade You’re Not Here (Ni Bu Zai), feierten ebenfalls internationale Erfolge. You’re Not Here war an der Chartspitze verschiedener Musikcharts für über 10 Wochen. Mit Unbelievable erhielt Wang zum zweiten Mal den Golden Melody Award als „Bester Produzent“ im Jahre 2004. Chinked-out (2004–2006) Mit seinem neu gefestigten Status als einer der einflussreichsten und produktivsten chinesischen Künstler der chinesischen Musik, setzte Wang seine Arbeit im Erfinden und Experimentieren von neuen Sounds und Stimmen fort. Für den Großteil des Jahres 2004 reiste er zu abgelegenen Dörfern Chinas, um ungehörte Stammesklänge der chinesischen Ureinwohner, tibetische und mongolische Musik zu sammeln. Mit seinem jüngeren Bruder Leekai als sein Assistent, trugen sie 15 kg Musik-Ausrüstung mit sich, um ihn diese Sounds aufnehmen zu lassen und sein Album unterwegs aufzunehmen und zu produzieren. Er integrierte die gesammelten Klänge in R&B und Hip Hop und nannte diesen selbstkreirten Stil „Chinked-out“. Trotz der ursprünglich abfälligen Bedeutung des Begriffes „chink“ (ähnlich dem deutschen Ausdruck ‚Schlitzauge‘), wollte Wang mit dieser Namensgebung das Wort wieder salonfähig und „cool“ machen. Shangri-La wurde Silvester 2004 veröffentlicht und verkaufte in den ersten zehn Tagen 40.000 Exemplare. Shangri-La wurde eine internationale Musiksensation, wobei es besonders Asiens Jugend ansprach. Innerhalb eines Monats verkaufte sich das Album über 300.000 Mal und brachte letztendlich insgesamt über 1,5 Millionen Tonträger an den Mann. Wang verarbeitete auch in seinem folgenden Album Heroes of Earth (2005) seine Chinked-out Elemente, wobei im Gegensatz zu der tribalen Musik bei „Shangri-La“, „Heroes of Earth“ mit Mischungen aus Pekingoper und Kun-Oper experimentierte. Um dem „Heroes-Konzept“ des Albums Ausdruck zu verleihen, holte er Künstler wie Ashin von der taiwanischen Band Mayday (Beside the Plum Blossoms), den chinesisch-amerikanischen Rapper Jin und Opernmeister Li Yan (Heroes of Earth), sowie K-Pop Künstler Rain und Lim Jeong-hee (Perfect Interaction) ins Studio. Heroes of Earth war 2005 und 2006 das am schnellstverkaufte Album mit über einer Million Verkäufen in den ersten zehn Tagen nach Veröffentlichung. Anschließend blieb das Album für die nächsten sechs Wochen an der Chartspitze und verweilte weitere 23 Wochen in den Charts. Es wurde das drittbestverkaufte Album des Jahres 2006. Mit Stand 2007 waren um die 3 Millionen CD-Einheiten über die Ladentische gegangen und es ist bis heute Wangs kommerziell und kritisch erfolgreichstes Album. Mit Heroes of Earth gewann Wang zum zweiten Mal den Golden Melody Award als „Bester Mandarin Sänger“. Drei Monate nach Veröffentlichung des Albums, begann er seine Heroes of Earth Tour, seine erste große Welttournee. Die Tour begann mit zwei Konzerten an einem Abend im Taipei Dome im März 2006 und brach damit Rekorde bei den Konzertteilnehmerzahlen Taiwans. Beruflicher Durchbruch (2007 bis Gegenwart) Wang legte eine Pause in Bezug auf die Arbeit an seine Musik ein und begann die Dreharbeiten zu Ang Lees Film Gefahr und Begierde (2007), einen Spionage-Thriller. Am 20. Juni 2007 veröffentlichte er die Single Falling Leaves Return to Roots (Luo Ye Gui Gen) auf Hito Radio, einem taiwanischen Radiosender, einen Monat bevor auch sein zwölftes Studioalbum Change Me in den Läden erscheinen sollte. Falling Leaves Return to Roots enthielt Broadway-Einflüsse mit klassischer Instrumentalbegleitung, wie der Geige und dem Klavier. Auf Fragen zu seinem plötzlichen Musikstil-Wechsels, erklärte Wang, dass er die Inspiration zu diesem Song dem Einfluss seiner Darstellung des Kuang Yumin in Gefahr und Begierde verdanke. „In der Vergangenheit habe ich nur Mainstream-Pop und Chinked-out bezogenen Hip Hop veröffentlicht. Gefahr und Begierde brachte mich zurück zum Shanghai der 1930er Jahre und ließ mich den Moment nacherleben.“ Change Me wurde am Freitag, den 13. Juli, veröffentlicht. Change me konzentrierte sich hauptsächlich auf Pop-Rock mit Broadway-Einflüssen (Falling Leaves Return to Roots) und taiwanischer Pop der alten Schule (You Are a Song in My Heart). Mit diesem Album thematisierte er die Klimaerwärmung und forderte ein besseres Umweltbewusstsein. Für die Verpackung des Albums wurde nur Recyclingpapier, ohne Plastik, verwendet. Er glaubte, dass schon kleinste Änderungen eines jeden Menschen die Welt retten könne. „Um die Welt zu ändern, verändere dich selbst zuerst.“ Rezensionen des Albums waren im Allgemeinen positiv und beschrieben es als „reif“. Eine Online- Albumumfrage von Chinas Sohu ergab jedoch, dass die Erwartungen vom Publikum nicht vollends erfüllt wurden. Netizens äußerte, dass Wangs Chinked-out-Produktionen beeindruckender gewesen seien, obwohl das Genre selbst auch Kritik einstecken musste. Dennoch wurden über eine Million Einheiten am ersten Veröffentlichungstag verkauft. Das Album brach die 2-Millionen-Grenze und wurde eines von Wangs bestverkauften Alben. August 2008 forderte Wang 320.000 US-Dollar Schadensersatz von dem indischen Komponisten Pritam. Ein Song des Bollywood-Films Race (2008), komponiert von Pritam, war offensichtlich ein Plagiat von In the Depths of the Bamboo Forest (Zhu Lin Shen Chu), eine Single von Leehom Wangs Shangri-La Album. Im November desselben Jahres wurde Wang auserwählt, das Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra zu ihrem großen 2008-Jahresfinale zu dirigieren. Er war der erste asiatische Popmusiker, dem diese Ehre erteilt wurde. Das Konzert Hong Kong Music, Leehom Wang (港樂‧王力宏) wurde im Hong Kong Cultural Centre an drei Abenden mit vier Shows aufgeführt und bekam eine ausführliche Berichterstattung von CNN International gewidmet. Wang startete in den letzten Monaten 2008 seine zweite Welttournee, die Music-Man Tour. Die Tour begann wie gewohnt in Taipei mit zwei Konzerten pro Nacht im Taipei Dome im September, drei Monate vor Veröffentlichung des dreizehnten Albums Heart.Beat, das am 26. Dezember erschien und sofort auf Platz 3 in den wöchentlichen G-Music Charts einstieg. Das Album erreichte in der siebten Woche Platz eins der Charts und blieb insgesamt für 17 weitere Wochen in den Listen präsent. Genau wie Wangs letztes Album, zeigte Heart.Beat einen ähnlichen Schwerpunkt hin zu den Rock-Einflüssen. Das Sound von Akustik- und E-Gitarren war dominierend, welche Wang auch für seine Darbietungen in den Musikvideos einsetzte. Zur Fortführung des Chinked-out-Elements verarbeitete er bei der ersten Single What’s Up with Rock?! Elemente westlicher Rockmusik mit chinesischem Einflüssen. Für den Track arbeitete er mit der Pipa-Spielerin Liu Fang zusammen. Am 15. April 2011 gewann Leehom Wang die Auszeichnungen für „Bester Sänger von Hongkong & Taiwan“, „Bestes Album“ für sein vierzehntes Album The 18 Martial Arts (2010), und „Bester Regie-Newcomer“ für sein Regiedebüt Love in Diguise bei den Global Chinese Music Awards. Am 5. November 2011 startete Wangs unter dem Titel Music-Man II – Open Fire seine dritte Welttournee. |
G;|Diego Forlán, vollständiger Name Diego Martín Forlán Corazo, (* 19. Mai 1979 in Montevideo) ist ein uruguayischer Fußballspieler, der zeitweise Rekordnationalspieler seines Landes war. Zudem war er vorübergehend Rekordtorschütze der Celeste.   Verein Anfänge in Uruguay und Argentinien Forlán, der in seiner frühen Jugend ein erfolgreicher Tennisspieler war, begann seine Fußballkarriere im Kinderfußball (Baby Fútbol) beim Carrasco Lawn Tennis Club. Anschließend spielte er in der sechsten und fünften División bei Peñarol. Von dort wechselte er zum Danubio FC – nach Forláns Aussage gegenüber CNN spielte er dort ein Jahr –, und trat für ihn in der vierten División an. Danubio verließ er im Jahr 1994 Richtung Club Atlético Independiente. Im November 1995 spielte er im Alter von 16 Jahren beim damaligen Zweitligisten AS Nancy unter Trainer László Bölöni vor, konnte die Verantwortlichen offenbar aber nicht überzeugen, auch wenn nach Aussage des seinerzeit dort aktiven Spielers Abdeslam Ouaddou Forláns vorhandenes Talent offensichtlich gewesen sei und kehrte nach fünf Monaten zurück. Bei Independiente spielte er zunächst im Nachwuchsteam in der vierten argentinischen Liga und trat dort mit zehn Treffern im Torneo Apertura als Torjäger in Erscheinung. Später kam er auch in der 3. División zum Einsatz. 1998 schaffte er unter dem Trainer der Reserve Raul Gordillo den Sprung in die von César Luis Menotti betreute Erste Mannschaft, die in der Primera División spielte. Er debütierte am 25. Oktober 1998 gegen die Argentinos Juniors. Den Karriere-Durchbruch vor Augen wurde er jedoch nach der Rückkehr von der Junioren-WM 1999 zunächst zurück in die Reserve geschickt. Erst nach dem Trainerwechsel zu Enzo Trossero gelangte er zurück ins Profi-Team. Statt im Angriff setzte dieser ihn im linken Mittelfeld ein. In der Saison 2000/01 absolvierte er 36 Spiele (18 Tore). Es folgten weitere 18 Spiele mit zwölf erzielten Treffern bis zum Jahresende 2001. Im Dezember 2001 verließ er Independiente. Manchester United Seine gute Torbilanz weckte das Interesse von europäischen Klubs. Im Januar 2002 war sich der CA Independiente mit dem englischen Erstligisten Middlesbrough FC einig; der Betrag über 6,9 Millionen Pfund sollte in 18 Raten bezahlt werden. Doch dieser Vertrag wurde nicht von Forlán unterzeichnet, denn am 22. Januar 2002 wechselte Forlán für den gleichen Preis zu Manchester United als Ersatz für den abgewanderten Andy Cole. Als Grund gab er an, dass Manchester mehr Geld als Middlesbrough bot. Sein Debüt feierte der Stürmer am 29. Januar 2002 beim 4:0-Sieg bei den Bolton Wanderers, als er in der 76. Minute für Ole Gunnar Solskjær eingewechselt wurde. Sein Startelfdebüt absolvierte Diego Forlán am 6. März 2002 beim 4:0-Sieg gegen Tottenham Hotspur. Seine erste Saison endete ohne Torerfolg in 13 Liga- und fünf Champions League-Spielen. In seiner zweiten Saison 2002/03 gewann er mit Manchester United den englischen Meistertitel. Forlán erzielte aber im Laufe seiner Zeit beim Klub aus Manchester nur zehn Liga-Tore in 63 Premier-League-Spielen für den englischen Klub und drei Tore in den europäischen Wettbewerben. Mit einem FA Cup-Tor und drei Treffern im Carling Cup brachte er es somit auf 17 Tore in seiner Zeit bei den Engländern. In der Spielzeit 2003/04 gewann er mit den Engländern den FA Cup. FC Villarreal Im August 2004 wechselte Diego Forlán für eine Ablösesumme von drei Millionen Euro zum FC Villarreal in die spanische Primera División. Bei den Spaniern unterzeichnete er einen Fünfjahresvertrag. In seiner ersten Spielzeit durfte er dabei für Villareal nicht im europäischen Wettbewerb auflaufen, da er bereits zuvor in der Saison im Spiel Manchesters gegen Dinamo Bukarest mitgewirkt hatte und daher für seinen neuen Club im UEFA-Cup gesperrt war. Mit 25 Toren in der Saison 2004/05, davon lediglich eines per Elfmeter erzielt, überholte er am letzten Spieltag den nahezu die gesamte Saison in dieser Wertung führenden Samuel Eto’o in der Torjägerliste und wurde spanischer Torschützenkönig. Zudem gewann er den goldenen Schuh als bester Torjäger Europas (gemeinsam mit Thierry Henry). Auch wurde er in jenem Jahr zum besten iberoamerikanischen Spieler der Saison gewählt und gewann damit die Trofeo EFE der spanischen Nachrichtenagentur EFE. Insgesamt erzielte Forlán 59 Treffer für Villarreal. Damit war er bis zur Ablösung in dieser Position am Jahresanfang 2011 durch Giuseppe Rossi der erfolgreichste Torschütze der Vereinsgeschichte. Atlético Madrid Am 30. Juni 2007 wurde Diego Forláns Transfer für 21 Millionen Euro zum Ligakonkurrenten Atlético Madrid besiegelt. Bei den Madrilenen unterzeichnete er einen Vier-Jahres-Vertrag. Durch diverse Zusatzklauseln stand eine spätere weitere Erhöhung der Ablösesumme um zwei Millionen Euro im Raum. Bereits seit April 2008 ist Forlán mit seinem seinerzeit 68. Treffer gegen Almería nach der Anzahl der erzielten Tore erfolgreichster Uruguayer in der Geschichte der spanischen Liga und löste somit seinen Landsmann José Luis Zalazar in dieser Rangliste ab. In jenem Jahr wurde Forlán zudem als bester iberoamerikanischer Spieler der Liga geehrt. In der Saison 2008/09 wurde Forlán mit 32 Liga-Toren zum zweiten Mal spanischer Torschützenkönig und gewann erneut den goldenen Schuh. Im in Hamburg ausgetragenen Finale der UEFA Europa League 2009/10 gegen den FC Fulham erzielte er beide Tore für Atlético Madrid, das nach Verlängerung mit 2:1 gewann. Anschließend erhielt er zudem die Auszeichnung als bester Spieler des Finals. Mit Atlético gewann er zudem im selben Jahr den Europäischen Supercup. Anfang März 2011 gelang Forlán dann der Einstieg in die Top 10 der erfolgreichsten Torschützen in der Historie des Madrider Vereins, da er bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt 74 erzielte Treffer in 127 Ligaspielen vorweisen konnte. Diese Trefferausbeute bedeutete einen Schnitt von 0,58 Toren pro Spiel. In einer Pressekonferenz Ende August 2011 verabschiedete er sich dann aus Madrid und hob als Höhepunkte seiner vier Jahre bei den Madrilenen das erfolgreiche Qualifikationsduell für die Champions-League gegen Schalke 04, das Finale der Europa League, den Europäischen Supercup, den Gewinn des Goldenen Schuhs und das verlorene Finale der Copa del Rey hervor. Insbesondere nach dem verlorenen Finale habe ihn die noch 45 Minuten nach Spielschluss anhaltende Unterstützung der Fans auf der Tribüne nachhaltig beeindruckt. Auch die persönliche Unterstützung für ihn und die "Uruguayo"-Rufe im Stadion blieben in seiner Erinnerung. Er verabschiede sich als Fan des Vereins. Der Vereinspräsident Atléticos Enrique Cerezo bezeichnete den Uruguayer anlässlich der Verabschiedung zu seinem neuen Arbeitgeber Inter Mailand als einen Spieler mit den Attributen „superlativo“ und „fantástico“. Insgesamt werden für Forlán 96 Pflichtspiel-Treffer in der nationalen Liga, in den europäischen Pokalwettbewerben einschließlich des Intertoto-Cups und der Copa del Rey geführt. Die Einsatzstatistik Forláns bei den spanischen Hauptstädtern weist insgesamt 134 Erstligaspiele mit 74 Treffern, sowie 46 absolvierte Partien der europäischen Vereinswettbewerbe (Champions-League inkl. Qualifikation, UEFA-Cup inkl. Qualifikation, Europa-League inkl. Qualifikation, Intertoto-Cup und Finale um den Super-Cup) aus, in denen er 16 Tore schoss. In seiner Zeit in Madrid klassierte Forlán als Fünfter bei der Wahl zum FIFA Ballon d’Or 2010. Inter Mailand Am 31. August 2011 gab Inter Mailand die Verpflichtung von Forlán auch offiziell bekannt. Forlán unterschrieb einen Zweijahresvertrag bis zum 30. Juni 2013. Auf Grund von Verletzungen kam er in der Saison 2011/12 jedoch nur unregelmäßig zum Einsatz. Während er in der Serie A immerhin 18-mal eingesetzt wurde und dabei zwei Tore erzielte, lief er in der Champions League nur in zwei Begegnungen auf (kein Tor). In seine Zeit bei Inter fiel der siebte Platz Forláns bei der Wahl zum FIFA Ballon d’Or 2011, die Lionel Messi gewann. SC Internacional Im Juli 2012 wechselte Forlán zum brasilianischen Erstligisten SC Internacional, bei dem er einen Dreijahresvertrag bis zum 30. Juni 2015 unterschrieb. Dort lief er in 47 Liga-Partien (13 im Campeonato Gaúcho, 34 in der Série A) auf und erzielte 19 Treffer (neun: Gaúcho/zehn: Série A). Auch steuerte er drei Tore bei acht Einsätzen in der Copa do Brasil bei. Der Verein selbst berichtet am Tag seines vorzeitigen Vertragsendes, dass er in 52 Partien für den Klub aufgelaufen sei und dabei 22 Tore erzielt habe. Eine Wettbewerbszuordnung der Spiele wurde dabei nicht vorgenommen. 2013 gewann er mit den Brasilianern die Staatsmeisterschaft von Rio Grande do Sul, das Campeonato Gaúcho. Cerezo Osaka Am 22. Januar 2014 löste Forlán seinen Vertrag mit dem SC Internacional auf und wechselte in die japanische J. League Division 1 zu Cerezo Osaka, wo er einen Vertrag bis zum 30. Dezember 2014 unterschrieb. Zudem existierte die Möglichkeit einer anschließenden halbjährigen Verlängerung. Im Mai 2014 erklärte Forlán in Bezug auf seine sportliche Zukunft, sich in Japan wohl zu fühlen, dass er sich aber auch noch eine Station in den Vereinigten Staaten vorstellen könnte. Gerüchte über ein zukünftiges Engagement bei Peñarol entkräftete er jedoch. Für die Japaner absolvierte er 26 Erstligaspiele und traf siebenmal ins gegnerische Tor. Überdies erzielte er zwei Treffer bei sechs Einsätzen in der AFC Champions League und lief je einmal im Kaiserpokal und dem J. League Cup auf, ohne dort einen persönlichen Torerfolg vorweisen zu können. Nach dem Abstieg mit dem Team in die zweite Liga Japans vermeldete der Klub am 2. Februar 2015, dass das Vertragsverhältnis mit Forlán bis zum 31. Juli 2015 fortgesetzt werde. In der J2 League wurde er in 16 Zweitligaspielen eingesetzt und schoss zehn Tore. Am 8. Juni 2015 erklärte er, dass er seinen auslaufenden Vertrag beim japanischen Verein nicht verlängern und sein dortiges Engagement somit nicht fortsetzen werde. Daraufhin wurde er am 21. Juni 2015 nach dem Spiel gegen Tokushima Vortis offiziell verabschiedet. Club Atlético Peñarol Nachdem über Wochen in der Presse über die bevorstehende Verpflichtung durch den Club Atlético Peñarol berichtet wurde, stellte der Verein ihn schließlich am 10. Juli 2015 offiziell als neuen Spieler vor. Er unterschrieb einen Vertrag bis 31. Dezember 2016. Am 16. August 2015 feierte er am 1. Spieltag der Spielzeit 2015/16 beim 3:0-Auswärtssieg über den Club Atlético Cerro sein Debüt bei den Aurinegros. Dieses stellte auch gleichzeitig sein Erstligadebüt in der uruguayischen Primera División dar. In der Saison 2015/16 gewann er mit dem Team die Apertura 2015 sowie den Meistertitel und absolvierte 31 Partien (acht Tore) in der höchsten uruguayischen Spielklasse sowie drei Begegnungen (kein Tor) in der Copa Libertadores 2016. Anschließend kündigte er seinen Abschied zum Saisonende an. Am 13. August 2016 gab Forlán bekannt, dass er von September bis Dezember 2016 für die von Alexandre Guimarães trainierte Mannschaft des indischen Klubs Mumbai City FC spielen werde. Nationalmannschaft Forlán nahm mit der uruguayischen U-20-Nationalmannschaft an der U-20-Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft 1999 in Nigeria teil, bei der man den vierten Platz belegte. Zu seinen Mitspielern zählten unter anderem Ernesto Chevantón und Diego Pérez. Auch gehörte er dem von Víctor Púa trainierten Kader bei der U-20-Südamerikameisterschaft desselben Jahres in Mar del Plata an. 2002 debütierte Forlán in der uruguayische A-Nationalmannschaft beim bisher einzigen Spiel gegen Saudi-Arabien und erzielte dabei sofort sein erstes Länderspieltor (Endstand 2:3). Sein erstes großes Turnier war die Weltmeisterschaft 2002 in Japan und Südkorea, bei dem Uruguay bereits in der Vorrunde ausschied und Forlán nur beim 3:3 gegen den Senegal eingesetzt wurde. 2004 nahm er an der Copa América in Peru teil, bei der Uruguay im Halbfinale im Elfmeterschießen gegen Brasilien verlor. Im gewonnenen Spiel um den dritten Platz kam er nicht zum Einsatz. In der Qualifikation zur WM 2006 trat Forlán kurzzeitig aus der seinerzeit von Jorge Fossati betreuten Nationalmannschaft zurück. Für die WM 2006 qualifizierte sich Uruguay nicht, da man in den interkontinentalen Playoff-Spielen gegen Australien im Elfmeterschießen verlor, nachdem beide Mannschaften jeweils mit 1:0 gewonnen hatten. 2007 nahm er an der Copa América in Venezuela teil, bei der er im Spiel um den dritten Platz mit 1:3 gegen Mexiko verlor. In der Qualifikation für die WM in Südafrika erzielte er sieben Tore und hatte damit Anteil an der erfolgreichen Qualifikation. Als stellvertretender Kapitän der uruguayischen Nationalmannschaft spielte Forlán auch bei der Weltmeisterschaft 2010 in Südafrika. Mit seinem Team erreichte er den vierten Platz und erzielte im Turnierverlauf fünf Treffer. Er wurde vor dem Niederländer Wesley Sneijder und Spaniens David Villa zum besten Spieler der WM gewählt und mit dem Goldenen Ball ausgezeichnet. Am 9. Juli 2011 bestritt er im Spiel gegen Chile bei der Copa América 2011 sein 78. Länderspiel und stellte den Rekord von Rodolfo Rodríguez ein. Am 13. Juli 2011 überbot er den Rekord im letzten Gruppenspiel gegen Mexiko und ist seitdem alleiniger Rekordhalter Uruguays. Am 24. Juli 2011 gewann er erstmals die Copa América, die bereits 1967 sein Großvater als Trainer und sein Vater als Spieler gewonnen hatten. Im Finale gegen Paraguay erzielte er zwei Tore, womit er insgesamt 31 Länderspieltore erzielt und damit den 81 Jahre alten Rekord von Héctor Scarone eingestellt hatte. Am 11. Oktober 2011 traf er im WM-Qualifikationsspiel in Paraguay zum 32. mal im Nationalmannschaftstrikot, womit er zu diesem Zeitpunkt alleiniger Rekordhalter war. Im Confed-Cupspiel gegen Nigeria bestritt er sein hundertstes Länderspiel. Dabei erzielte er in der 51. Minute den Treffer zum 2:1 und wurde dadurch mit 34 Länderspieltreffern – und damit einem Tor Vorsprung auf seinen Mannschaftskameraden Luis Suárez, der zwischenzeitlich die Rekordmarke Forláns egalisiert hatte – wieder alleiniger Rekordtorschütze Uruguays. Im folgenden Spiel gegen Tahiti, in dem Tabárez die Stammspieler für das Halbfinale schonte, wurde Forlán nicht eingesetzt. Suárez wurde in der 69. Minute eingewechselt und erzielte zwei weitere Tore, womit Suárez nun alleiniger Rekordtorschütze ist. Im Halbfinale gegen Brasilien hatte er die Chance durch einen Strafstoß mit Suárez wieder gleichzuziehen, sein ehemaliger Mitspieler bei Inter Mailand Júlio César konnte den Strafstoß aber abwehren. Auch im Elfmeterschießen, das das Spiel um Platz 3 gegen Italien entscheiden musste, konnte er seinen Elfmeter nicht verwandeln. Da der italienische Torhüter Gianluigi Buffon zudem zwei weitere Elfmeter halten konnte, während der uruguayische Torhüter nur einen halten konnte, musste sich Uruguay wie 1997 mit Platz 4 begnügen. Am 14. August 2013 erzielte er beim 4:2-Sieg gegen Japan in der 26. und 28. Minute die ersten beiden Tore und wurde damit wieder alleiniger Rekordtorschütze. In der 52. Minute erzielte Luis Suárez ebenfalls ein Tor und zog mit Forlán wieder gleich. Seit der Partie vom 6. September 2013 gegen Peru hat Suárez jedoch durch zwei erzielte Tore die Führung in der Rekordtorschützenliste übernommen. Bei der Weltmeisterschaft 2014 in Brasilien gehörte Forlán erneut dem Aufgebot Uruguays an. Er absolvierte 112 Länderspiele und erzielte 36 Länderspieltore. Sein letzter Nationalmannschaftseinsatz datiert vom 28. Juni 2014. Am 12. März 2015 erklärte er seinen Rücktritt aus der Nationalmannschaft. |
G;|Bernd Rabehl (* 30. Juli 1938 in Rathenow) ist ein deutscher Autor und war eines der bekanntesten Mitglieder des Sozialistischen Deutschen Studentenbunds (SDS). Spätestens seit 1998 vertritt Rabehl nationalistische und seit einiger Zeit später rechtsextreme Positionen.  Über Kindheit und Jugend Bernd Rabehls im Nationalsozialismus und in der beginnenden DDR sind bislang kaum Quellen verfügbar. In dem selbstverfassten Biogramm zu seiner Dissertation Marx und Lenin (1973) schrieb er, die „antifaschistische Grundschule, die Mitgliedschaft in der FDJ, die Oberschule“ und die erzwungene „Tätigkeit als Hilfsarbeiter“ hätten nachhaltigen Einfluss auf seine Erziehung gehabt. Die Journalistin und Fotografin Bärbel C. Richter, Redakteurin und Gestalterin von Rabehls Blog, zeichnet folgendes Bild Rabehls: In einem Interview für secret TV mit dem häufig wegen geschichtsrevisionistischer Film-Produktionen kritisierten Michael Vogt erinnerte sich Rabehl 2007 an frühe Prägungen zur „nationalen Frage“. Er zitiert in dem Interview ein Lied von Bertolt Brecht, das zu seiner FDJ-Zeit gesungen wurde: „Adenauer, Adenauer zeig Deine Hand, für 30 Silberlinge verkaufst Du unser Land.“ 1960 nahm er für zwei Semester ein Studium der Agronomie an der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin auf, ging jedoch noch vor dem Mauerbau nach West-Berlin und begann an der Freien Universität Berlin Soziologie und Philosophie zu studieren. Als Fluchthelfer schleuste er – so sagen es später von ihm selbst verfasste Lebensläufe – nach dem Mauerbau Freunde und Bekannte aus der DDR. Damit, wie auch mit seinen politischen Schriften, handelte er sich ein langjähriges Einreiseverbot in den Ostblock ein. Der Mauerbau 1961 war ein entscheidendes Ereignis nicht nur für Rabehls Haltung zum Osten, sondern auch für seine Haltung zum Westen. In einem 1968 publizierten Aufsatz schrieb er, dass „die gutgläubigen Studenten und die Arbeiterjugend“ – darunter Rudi Dutschke und er selbst – versucht hätten, die Mauer zu stürmen. „Sie fälschten Pässe, gruben Tunnel, zerschnitten Zäune oder malten ihre Parolen von der Freiheit an den Zement … Die Ernüchterung folgte schnell und zog die Erkenntnis nach sich, dass der Mauerbau mit Zustimmung der USA stattgefunden hatte.“ Die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika hätten sich mit dieser Bestätigung der Verabredungen von Teheran, Jalta und Potsdam gleichzeitig darauf festgelegt, „ungestört die Befreiungsbewegungen in der Dritten Welt zu zerschlagen“. Auch die Haltung der bundesdeutschen Politiker zum Mauerbau habe erkennen lassen, „dass sie nicht zur ‚entscheidenden Tat‘ bereit waren“, das Mittel des Krieges sei ihnen „durch die innerkapitalistische Machtaufteilung nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg verwehrt“ gewesen. Rabehl war in den sechziger Jahren ein enger Freund und Wegbegleiter Dutschkes. 1962 stießen sie gemeinsam zur Gruppe „Subversive Aktion“, die von Dieter Kunzelmann und anderen in München gegründet worden war. Die Gruppe hatte Außenstellen in Tübingen, Stuttgart, Frankfurt am Main und in West-Berlin. Sie machte mit künstlerisch-provokatorischen Aktionen auf sich aufmerksam. Im Rückblick (1988) schilderte Rabehl seine eigene Situation und die Dutschkes in dieser Gruppe so: Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund, Verhältnis zu Dutschke 1965 trat Rabehl zusammen mit Dutschke dem SDS bei. Wie Reinhard Strecker in einem Interview zeigte, führte der Einfluss von Dutschke, Rabehl und weiteren Personen im SDS dazu, dass dessen Initiativen, die NS-Vergangenheit der Bundesrepublik aufzuarbeiten, mehr oder minder aufgegeben wurden. 1967/68 war Rabehl im Bundesvorstand des SDS tätig. Intern ließ er bereits 1967 ein Papier zirkulieren, in dem er die Übertragung des so genannten „Befreiungsnationalismus“ Frantz Fanons auf die deutschen Verhältnisse vorschlug. In diesem Papier hieß es: 1969/70 war Rabehl einer der Initiatoren der sogenannten Ruhrkampagne. Dies war zunächst nur ein Lesezirkel, der das Ruhrgebiet für die revolutionären Studenten erobern wollte, allerdings wollte man erst ein Lenin- und Stalin-Lektüreprogramm absolvieren, vor Ort Erkundigungen einziehen und eine Orts- und Klassenanalyse anfertigen. In diesem Kontext entstand Rabehls Schrift über die DKP. Die Ruhrkampagne kam nie im Ruhrgebiet an. Ein Teil der Aktivisten gründeten später die KPD/ML; Rabehl gehörte nicht zu ihnen. 1973 schloss Rabehl seine Dissertation ab. Dutschkes Witwe Gretchen Dutschke-Klotz berichtet in der Biografie über ihren Mann, es sei über die Arbeit zu einem schweren Konflikt zwischen ihm und Rabehl gekommen. Dutschke habe darauf bestanden, Rabehl habe von ihm für seine Dissertation die Idee der Analyse der Sowjetunion als zeitgenössische „asiatische Produktionsweise“ mehr oder minder abgeschrieben. Rabehl bestreitet das. In den 1970er Jahren war Rabehl Mitglied der Redaktionskonferenz der Zeitschrift Probleme des Klassenkampfs und des Rotbuchkollektivs. Zwischen 1973 und 1984 arbeitete er zunächst als Mitarbeiter und Dozent am Soziologischen Institut der Freien Universität Berlin. Danach war er mehrere Jahre als Gastprofessor an der Bundesuniversität von Campina Grande (Brasilien) tätig. Neben zahlreichen Artikeln veröffentlichte er mehrere Monographien zu Marxismus und Arbeiterbewegung. Nach seiner Rückkehr lehrte er wieder am Soziologischen Institut und forschte zugleich am Zentralinstitut für sozialwissenschaftliche Forschung (ZI 6 bzw. ZISOWIFO), zuletzt am Otto-Suhr-Institut der Freien Universität Berlin. Zusammen mit Siegward Lönnendonker und Jochen Staadt veröffentlichte er in diesem Zusammenhang in dem von der VolkswagenStiftung geförderten „SDS-Projekt“ Beiträge zu einer Geschichte des SDS. Rabehl beschrieb in den Beiträgen zu diesem Projekt den SDS vor allem als „Provokationselite“. Er stellte auch die Verschiedenheit der Interessen von Flüchtlingen aus der DDR und „Westlern“ im SDS heraus. Rudi Dutschkes Hauptinteresse habe demnach nicht, wie bei den „Westlern“, dem „Internationalismus“, sondern der „Deutschen Frage“ gegolten. Deutschland sei für Dutschke und andere „DDR-Abhauer“ im SDS ein von den Besatzungsmächten in Unfreiheit gehaltenes Land gewesen. Nach dem Zusammenbruch der DDR arbeitete Rabehl im Forschungsverbund SED-Staat unter anderem zur Einflussnahme des MfS auf den SDS. Wendepunkt: „Danubia-Rede“ Ende 1998 hielt Bernd Rabehl in München eine Rede vor der Burschenschaft Danubia. Dort warnte er unter anderem vor einer kulturellen „Überfremdung“ Deutschlands, die bereits jetzt bürgerkriegsähnliche Zustände und den Terrorismus in Deutschland und Europa befördere. Darüber hinaus behauptete er in seinem Vortrag, dass die „Antifa-Linke“ und „bestimmte Medien im In- und Ausland“ dieses Thema tabuisierten: Über Horst Mahler gelangte die Rede an die Wochenzeitung Junge Freiheit und wurde dort mit etlichen inhaltlichen Änderungen veröffentlicht, ohne dass redaktionell auf diese Veränderungen hingewiesen worden wäre. Rabehl kritisierte in einem Brief an die Redaktion die unautorisierte Veröffentlichung. Die wesentlichen Inhalte des Redetextes selbst bestritt er nicht. In der Folge schrieb er weiterhin zu verschiedenen Themen in der Jungen Freiheit. Nach der Publikation der Rede wurden Rabehl völkischer Nationalismus und sekundärer Antisemitismus vorgeworfen. Er wies dies als Denunziation zurück. Die in der Rede enthaltene nationalrevolutionäre Deutung der Revolte von 1968 und insbesondere der Person Dutschkes wurde von Kollegen, Freunden und Linken als rechtsradikales „coming out“ von Rabehl interpretiert. Die Berliner Zeitung berichtete, Rabehl habe bei einer Diskussion mit SDS-Veteranen gesagt, er habe selbst festgestellt, dass der Text der Nazi-Sprache sehr nahe käme. Die Zeitung zitierte Rabehl mit den Worten: „Oh, das ist ja LTI-Sprache, die Sprache des Dritten Reichs.“ Er wolle jedoch, so die Berliner Zeitung, von diesem Text inhaltlich nichts zurücknehmen. Nach dem Vortrag vor der Burschenschaft Danubia radikalisierte Rabehl seine Anschauungen zusehends. Insbesondere rückte eine angebliche „Auschwitz-Keule“ immer mehr ins Zentrum seiner Überlegungen. In einem Interview mit der Jungen Freiheit bezeichnete Rabehl das „Antisemitismus-Tabu“ als das „Meistertabu“ der gegenwärtigen deutschen Gesellschaft, das insbesondere vom Staat Israel gegen Europa und Nordamerika eingesetzt würde, um Kritiker mundtot zu machen, aber auch von den Regierungen Nordamerikas und Europas verwendet würde, um Opponenten in den eigenen Ländern zum Schweigen zu bringen. Wörtlich sagte Rabehl: Rabehl sah und sieht sich absichtlich missverstanden. Man wolle ihn, so formulierte er es in mehreren Veröffentlichungen, zerstören. In einem Essay zu Rudi Dutschke deutete er die heftige Kritik, der er sich seit seinem Vortrag vor der Burschenschaft Danubia ausgesetzt sah, als üble Kampagne, an der sich „Spitzel und Zuträger von MfS und HVA“ sowie „Profiteure und Parasiten aus dem Kulturbetrieb“ beteiligten. „Die Regie“, so schreibt Rabehl, „verwies nicht auf Antifa-Sekten, sondern auf ausländische Geheimdienste.“ Im Januar 2000 erschienen offene Briefe des Politologen Andrei S. Markovits in der gewerkschaftsnahen Zeitschrift Express und im Tagesspiegel. Am 10. Februar entband die gewerkschaftsnahe Hans-Böckler-Stiftung Rabehl von seiner Funktion als Vertrauensdozent. Rabehl trat 2000 aus dem DGB aus und schloss sich später dem Deutschen Handels- und Industrieangestellten-Verband (DHV) im CGB an. Aus diesem wurde er 2005 ausgeschlossen. Hofgeismarer Kreis 1992 trafen sich ein paar Dutzend junge Sozialdemokraten auf dem geschichtsträchtigen Schloss Windischleuba in Thüringen, um an die Tradition des Hofgeismarer Kreises anzuknüpfen. Führend waren dabei der damalige Leipziger Jusovorsitzende und Junge-Freiheit-Autor Sascha Jung, Bernd Rabehl und Tilman Fichter. NPD, DVU und Querfront In einem Interview mit der NPD-Zeitung Deutsche Stimme vom März 2005 sagte Bernd Rabehl zu der Kritik, dass er sich, ähnlich wie Horst Mahler, von einem linksradikalen Kritiker der Bundesrepublik zu einem rechtsradikalen Opponenten entwickelt habe: „In letzter Konsequenz bin ich meinem Denken von damals treu geblieben, nur dass sich inzwischen die politischen Positionen verschoben haben. Was früher als ‚links‘ angesehen wurde, gilt heute als ‚rechts‘.“ Rabehl wiederholte in dem Interview außerdem viele seiner Thesen aus der Danubia-Rede. Das Otto-Suhr-Institut der Freien Universität Berlin versuchte ihm als Reaktion auf dieses Interview die Lehrbefugnis zu entziehen. Die NPD kritisierte diesen Versuch sofort. In einer Presseerklärung der Partei vom 18. Mai 2005 hieß es, man sähe nach „den Kampagnen gegen den Bundestagsabgeordneten Martin Hohmann, den Brigadegeneral Reinhard Günzel und den ehemaligen stellvertretenden Bundeskanzler Jürgen Möllemann“ in den „Drohungen“ gegen Bernd Rabehl „ein weiteres besorgniserregendes Zeichen für die dramatische Krise der Meinungs- und Gewissensfreiheit in Deutschland.“ Der Geschäftsführer des Otto-Suhr-Instituts, Bodo Zeuner, begründete dagegen diesen Versuch in einem von der Berliner Tageszeitung Der Tagesspiegel teilweise wiedergegebenen Brief vom 20. Mai 2005 an Rabehl. Darin schrieb er, dass Rabehl „rechtsextreme und völkisch-nationalistische Thesen zur angeblichen Überfremdung, zu angeblichen Verschwörungen internationaler Geheimdienste und Geheimgesellschaften, zur angeblich planmäßigen Zerstörung einer deutschen nationalen Identität und Kultur“ übernehme. Wer wie Rabehl über völkisch-nationalistische Konzeptionen nachdenke und die wissenschaftlichen Kenntnisse über den Zusammenhang dieses Denkens mit der mörderischen NS-Herrschaft nicht reflektiere, betreibe „keine Politikwissenschaft auf dem ethischen und kognitiven Standard, den der FB Politik- und Sozialwissenschaften von seinen Dozenten verlangen muss und zu Recht verlangt.“ Am 8. Juni 2005 verteidigte Rabehl seine politischen Positionen während eines Vortrages vor der Fraktion der NPD im Sächsischen Landtag und am 9. Juni 2005 auf einer Pressekonferenz mit der NPD-Landtagsfraktion. Als sich der Entzug der Lehrbefugnis als juristisch unmöglich herausstellte, beschloss das Otto-Suhr-Institut der Freien Universität Berlin, Rabehl keine Lehraufträge mehr zu erteilen und ihn nicht mehr an Prüfungen teilnehmen zu lassen. Die Rechtsabteilung der Universität erwirkte jedoch, Lehrveranstaltungen Rabehls wieder zuzulassen. Sie fanden dann allerdings außerhalb des prüfungsrelevanten Kanons statt. 2006 war Rabehl bei der DVU-Fraktion im Landtag Brandenburg zu Gast und trat auf einer Fraktionssitzung auf. Sein Thema waren Theorie und Praxis der 68er. Bei der Wahl zur Bremischen Bürgerschaft 2007 kandidierte Rabehl auf dem 6. Listenplatz der rechtskonservativen Liste Bremen muß leben von Joachim Siegerist erfolglos für die Bremische Bürgerschaft. 2005/06 wirkte Rabehl auch als Interviewpartner an einem Film anlässlich des 60. Jahrestages der Nürnberger Prozesse mit. Der Film wurde von Michael Vogt produziert. In einem Interview, das der DVD als Bonusmaterial beigegeben ist, äußert sich Rabehl zu den Nürnberger Prozessen. Hier hätten „Killer über Killer zu Gericht“ gesessen. Der Prozess sei lediglich eine „Farce“ gewesen. In den anderen Interviews zu diesem Film kommen mit Alfred de Zayas, Franz W. Seidler und Alexander von Stahl durchweg Publizisten zu Wort, die für ihre geschichtsrevisionistischen Thesen bezüglich Deutschland bekannt sind. Rabehl trat seit 2005 bei verschiedenen Veranstaltungen der NPD auf. In Sachsen und Mecklenburg-Vorpommern wurde er von den jeweiligen Landtagsfraktionen der Partei auch als Sachverständiger für Fragen der Landesverfassung benannt. Befragt, was diese Auftritte bei der NPD zu bedeuten hätten, sagte er gegenüber Spiegel Online, er plane eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit über die NPD und wolle sich auf diese Weise seinem Forschungsobjekt nähern. Den Titel dieser Arbeit gab Rabehl mit Die Faschismusjäger, der „europäische Faschismus“ und die NPD an. Einen Aufsatz Rabehls mit diesem Titel publizierte die NPD-Landtagsfraktion Sachsen 2005. Wie weit Rabehl sich inzwischen mit der NPD identifiziert, wurde am 10. Januar 2009 deutlich. Rabehl hielt beim Neujahrsempfang der NPD-Landtagsfraktion in Sachsen eine der Festreden. Er kritisierte dort das internationale Finanzsystem und konstatierte den Untergang der deutschen Sprache und Kultur, des Bildungssystems und der deutschen Stadt. Rabehl tritt jedoch auch bei rechtslastigen Organisationen in anderen europäischen Ländern auf. Am 8. Februar 2009 referierte er zum Beispiel vor der Ortsgruppe Langenthal der Partei National Orientierter Schweizer (PNOS), die 2001 vom Schweizer Bundesamt der Polizei als rechtsextreme Organisation eingestuft wurde, mittlerweile jedoch als Gruppierung der Neuen Rechten gilt. Rabehl führte in seinem Vortrag aus, so referiert es die Website der Organisation, dass es „natürlich ein erklärtes Ziel der Herrscher“ sei, „jene Kräfte gegeneinander aufzuhetzen, die sich gegen die US-amerikanische Hegemonie zur Wehr setzten. Eine Querfront, so Rabehl, wäre einzig und allein in der Lage, überhaupt etwas zu bewegen.“ Kandidatur zum Bundespräsidentenamt NPD und DVU hatten ursprünglich die Zusage von Rabehl, dass er bereit wäre, als ihr gemeinsamer Kandidat für das Bundespräsidentenamt zu kandidieren. Rabehl zog seine Zusage jedoch kurz vor der am 8. März 2009 geplanten Nominierung zurück. Holger Apfel, damals stellvertretender Bundesvorsitzender der NPD, erläuterte in einem Internetforum, Rabehl habe seine ursprüngliche Zusage zur Kandidatur aus gesundheitlichen Gründen zurückgezogen. Die in verschiedenen Medien veröffentlichten politischen Begründungen Rabehls, in denen er grundlegende Differenzen zu NPD und DVU hervorhob und erklärte, er wolle nicht in einer „Marionettenrolle“ auftreten, seien nachgeschoben, Rabehl habe offenbar der Mut verlassen. Noch am 6. März habe Rabehl der NPD einen Beitrag zugesandt, der auf einer für seine Kandidatur vorbereiteten Internetseite veröffentlicht werden sollte. In dem Beitrag für die geplante Internetseite, den Holger Apfel zugänglich machte, schrieb Rabehl: Trotz seines Rückzuges von der Kandidatur zum Bundespräsidentenamt hat Rabehl sich offenbar mit NPD und DVU nicht überworfen. Die DVU veröffentlicht in ihrer National-Zeitung mehrere Aufsätze von ihm. Die NPD äußerte Verständnis für seinen Rückzug. Rabehl, der bislang auf die Frage nach den Gründen seiner Auftritte bei DVU und NPD immer geantwortet hatte, er wolle schließlich genau kennen, was er erforsche, bezeichnet in seinem Beitrag für die National-Zeitung vom 17. April 2009 die Zusammenarbeit mit NPD und DVU und die dann letztlich doch zurückgezogene Kandidatur für das Bundespräsidentenamt nun ausdrücklich als „Experiment“. Bernd Rabehl ist pensioniert und lebt als freier Autor in Berlin. Er unterhält ein eigenes Blog. Rabehl macht aus seiner politischen Orientierung keinen Hehl. Einem Reporter der Zeit erklärte er 2011: „Ich bin rechts, weil es keine Linke mehr gibt.“ |
G;|James Oliver Eastland (* 28. November 1904 in Doddsville, Sunflower County, Mississippi; † 19. Februar 1986 ebenda) war ein US-amerikanischer Politiker der Demokratischen Partei. Vom 30. Juni 1941 bis zum 28. September 1941 sowie vom 3. Januar 1943 bis zu seinem Ausscheiden aus der Politik am 27. Dezember 1978 war er einer der beiden US-Senatoren des Bundesstaates Mississippi.   Abgeordneter im Repräsentantenhaus des Bundesstaates Mississippi 1928, gerade 24 Jahre alt, wurde Eastland als Kandidat der Demokratischen Partei ins Repräsentantenhaus von Mississippi (State House of Representatives) gewählt. Zusammen mit Courtney C. Pace und Kelly J. Hammond gehörte Eastland zu den maßgeblichen Unterstützern des damaligen Gouverneurs von Mississippi, Theodore G. Bilbo. Bilbo, überzeugter Verfechter der White Supremacy („Überlegenheit der weißen Rasse“) und für seine rassistische Rhetorik berüchtigt, verfocht in späteren Jahren, nachdem er zum US-Senator gewählt worden war, beständig die Idee, die gesamte schwarze Bevölkerung der USA zurück nach Afrika (Liberia) zu deportieren: „It is essential to the perpetuation of our Anglo-Saxon civilization that white supremacy be maintained, and to maintain our civilization there is only one solution, and that is either by segregation within the United States, or by deportation of the entire Negro race to its native heath, Africa.“ („Es ist für das Fortbestehen unserer angelsächsischen Zivilisation ausschlaggebend die Überlegenheit der weißen Rasse aufrecht zu halten, und um unsere Zivilisation aufrecht zu halten, gibt es nur eine Lösung, und das ist entweder die Rassentrennung innerhalb der Vereinigten Staaten, oder die Deportation der gesamten schwarzen Rasse in ihr ursprüngliches Herkunftsgebiet, nach Afrika.“) (Cong. Rec., 75. Cong., 3. Sess., 881) Als 1932 Bilbos Gouverneurs-Amtszeit auslief, zog sich auch Eastland zunächst aus der Politik zurück und trat nicht für eine Wiederwahl zum Staatsparlament an. Er heiratete 1932 die Arzttochter Elizabeth Coleman (s.u. „Privates“), eröffnete eine Anwaltskanzlei in Ruleville, wenige Kilometer von seinem Geburtsort Doddsville entfernt. Zugleich begann er (auf Wunsch seines Vaters) die elterliche Baumwoll-Plantage zu bewirtschaften. In den folgenden Jahren modernisierte er den landwirtschaftlichen Betrieb und vergrößerte ihn von ursprünglich 2300 acres auf rund 6000 acres (rund 24 km²). Auch nachdem er später erneut in die Politik zurückkehrte, betrachtete er sich selbst doch immer zuallererst als Plantagenbesitzer, was sich auch in seinen politischen Ansichten niederschlug. Senator Als Pat Harrison, einer der beiden Senatoren Mississippis, am 22. Juni 1941, noch vor dem Ende seiner Amtszeit verstarb, beauftragte der Gouverneur von Mississippi, Paul B. Johnson, den jungen James Eastland, den vakanten Posten bis zu (vorgezogenen) Neuwahlen wahrzunehmen. (Johnson hatte zunächst James Eastlands Vater gebeten, die Vakanz auszufüllen, doch der hatte abgelehnt.) So wurde Eastland vom 30. Juni bis zum 28. September 1941 - für ganze 88 Tage - Senator von Mississippi. Eastland nutzte die wenigen Wochen allerdings dazu, eine von der US-Regierung geplante Preisobergrenze für Baumwollsamenöl zu verhindern, was ihm große Sympathien bei den Baumwollproduzenten der Südstaaten einbrachte. Eastland selbst rühmte sich, durch die Verhinderung der Preisbeschränkungen 50 Millionen Dollar in die Taschen der Baumwollproduzenten geschwemmt zu haben. Bei der vorgezogenen Senatoren-Wahl trat Eastman nicht an – dies nicht zu tun, hatte er bei der Übernahme des Senatssitzes versprechen müssen – und so wurde bis zu den regulären Wahlen im Jahre 1942 zunächst Wall Doxey zum Senator gewählt. Eastland gewann jedoch die folgende reguläre Wahl im Jahre 1942 gegen den nunmehrigen Amtsinhaber Doxey, obwohl dieser von Präsident Franklin D. Roosevelt sowie Theodore G. Bilbo massiv unterstützt wurde. Bei den nächsten Senats-Wahlen im Jahre 1948 wurde Eastland ohne Gegenkandidat erneut bestätigt. 1954, 1960, 1966 und 1972 wurde er immer wieder gewählt und war so einer der beiden Senatoren des Bundesstaates Mississippi über den Gesamtzeitraum vom 3. Januar 1943 bis zu seinem Ausscheiden aus der Politik am 27. Dezember 1978. Eastland und die Aufhebung der Rassentrennung Im Jahre 1954 standen die nächsten Senats-Wahlen an, doch Eastland beabsichtigte zunächst nicht noch einmal anzutreten. Er stellte schon öffentlich Überlegungen an, sich ganz aus der Politik zurückzuziehen, entschied sich aber letztlich anders und musste den Wahlkampf gegen Vizegouverneur Carroll Gartin bestreiten. Kurz bevor Eastland mit der Kampagne für seine Wiederwahl begann, fällte der Oberste Gerichtshof eine Grundsatzentscheidung hinsichtlich der Rassentrennung an den öffentlichen Schulen der USA. Mit dem Urteil in dem Rechtsstreit Brown vs. Board of Education, von Topeka, Kansas, vom 17. Mai 1954 wurde die bis dahin herrschende Rassentrennung an öffentlichen Schulen aufgehoben. Nach einer Sammelklage betroffener Eltern im Bundesstaat Kansas gegen die damals noch vorgeschriebene Rassentrennung an staatlichen (öffentlichen) Grundschulen, hob der Supreme Court mit seinem Urteil diese Rassentrennung in den gesamten Vereinigten Staaten auf, da sie eine Verletzung des Gleichheitsgrundsatzes, wie sie im 14. Verfassungszusatz vorgegeben war, darstelle. Diese wegweisende Grundsatzentscheidung markierte das Ende der rechtlich sanktionierten Rassentrennung an staatlichen Schulen in den Vereinigten Staaten. Ein Jahr später, am 31. Mai 1955, wurde überdies vom Obersten Gerichtshof beschlossen, dass die Aufhebung der Rassentrennung an öffentlichen Schulen „with all deliberate speed“ („in angemessener Eile“) durchgeführt werden müsse. Ein weiteres Jahr später, am 5. Mai 1956, dehnte der Oberste Gerichtshof das Verbot der Rassentrennung auch auf solche Schulen und Universitäten aus, die mit öffentlichen Mitteln subventioniert wurden. Eastland nutzte diese Entscheidung für den Stimmenfang. Indem er das Urteil wieder und wieder scharf angriff und seine Annullierung forderte, konnte er sich der Stimmen der weißen Wähler Mississippis sicher sein, seinen Namen als Verteidiger der Rassentrennung und der „white supremacy“ festigen. Er diffamierte die Gerichtsentscheidungen als illegal, sah in ihr Tyrannei und betrachtete es als eine Christenpflicht gegen dieses Urteil Widerstand zu leisten: „Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God“ („Widerstand gegen eine Tyrannei ist der Auftrag Gottes“). Eastland war Mitglied der Methodisten. In einer Rede, die er kurze Zeit nach der Gerichtsentscheidung Brown vs. Board of Education vor dem Senat hielt, machte er seine Ansichten zur Rassentrennung klar: “The Southern institution of racial segregation or racial separation was the correct, self-evident truth which arose from the chaos and confusion of the Reconstruction period. Separation promotes racial harmony. It permits each race to follow its own pursuits, and its own civilization. Segregation is not discrimination… Mr. President, it is the law of nature, it is the law of God, that every race has both the right and the duty to perpetuate itself. All free men have the right to associate exclusively with members of their own race, free from governmental interference, if they so desire.” („Die überkommene Einrichtung der Südstaaten hinsichtlich der Rassentrennung war die völlig richtige, selbstverständliche Wahrheit, die sich aus dem Chaos und den Wirrnissen der Zeit der Reconstruction ergab. Rassentrennung ist die Grundlage von Harmonie zwischen den Rassen. Die Trennung erlaubt es jeder [einzelnen] Rasse ihre [eigenen] Interessen zu verfolgen, ihre eigene Kultur zu entwickeln. Rassentrennung ist keinesfalls Diskriminierung... Herr Präsident, es ist ein Naturgesetz, es ist von Gott gegeben, dass jede Rasse das Recht und auch die Pflicht hat, sich weiter fortzupflanzen. Alle freien Menschen können für sich das Recht in Anspruch nehmen sich ausschließlich mit Angehörigen ihrer eigenen Rasse zu versammeln, wenn sie dies so wünschen – und zwar unbehelligt von Maßnahmen der Regierung....“) In einer Rede, am 12. August 1955 in Senatobia, Mississippi gehalten, äußerte er sich folgendermaßen: “On May 17, 1954, the Constitution of the United States was destroyed because of the Supreme Court's decision. You are not obliged to obey the decisions of any court which are plainly fraudulent [based on] sociological considerations.” („Am 17. Mai 1954 ist die Verfassung der Vereinigten Staaten durch die Entscheidung des Obersten Gerichtshofs zerstört worden. Kein Mensch ist [jedoch] verpflichtet Entscheidungen irgendeines Gerichtes zu akzeptieren, die sich hinterhältig einzig und allein auf soziologische Betrachtungen stützt.“) In dieser Zeit wurde er einer der populärsten Redner auf den Versammlungen der White Citizens’ Councils (WCC). Am 11. Juli 1954 – knapp einen Monat nach der og. Grundsatzentscheidung des Supreme Court – hatte sich die erste Gruppe von weißen Amerikanern unter der Führung von Robert Patterson in Indianola, Sunflower County – nur wenige Kilometer südlich von Eastlands Heimatort Doddsville gelegen - zusammengefunden. In anderen Gemeinden Mississippis folgten schnell weitere Council-Gründungen und innerhalb weniger Monate breitete sich diese Bewegung in sämtlichen südlichen Bundesstaaten – dem so genannten Deep South – aus. Man formierte sich zu einem übergreifenden Zusammenschluss: dem Citizens’ Council of America (CCA). Die Mitglieder dieser Councils waren zumeist angesehene, vor allem einflussreiche, weiße Bürger der jeweiligen Gemeinden – Plantagenbesitzer, Banker, Kaufleute, Ärzte, Rechtsanwälte, Beamte, Angehörige der Kirchen und Lehrer – die sich zum Ziel gesetzt hatten, die Durchsetzung der Entscheidung des Supreme Court mit allen Mitteln zu verhindern. Anders als die Angehörigen des Ku-Klux-Klan, die durchweg gewaltsam vorgingen, lehnten die WCC-Mitglieder – zumindest in ihren offiziellen Verlautbarungen – die Anwendung roher Gewalt ab. Die Ideologie und strategischen Ziele der WCC waren jedoch weitgehend identisch mit denen des Klan. Der Unterschied lag „lediglich“ in der taktischen Vorgehensweise: Man ergriff „subtilere“ Maßnahmen gegen den vermeintlichen Gegner: Schwarze, Bürgerrechtler und andere Befürworter der Rassengleichstellung wurden mit „ökonomischen Maßnahmen“ stranguliert: Man drängte sie aus ihren Berufen, oder verhinderte, dass sie Arbeit aufnehmen konnten usw. Aufgrund der Mitgliederstruktur und der „feineren“ Vorgehensweise wurden daher die WCC auch als „the uptown Ku Klux Klan“ („Ku-Klux-Klan der Oberstadt“, oder etwas freier übersetzt: „ein Ku-Klux-Klan für die besseren Kreise“) bezeichnet. Eastland bestritt zeitlebens, jemals Mitglied des White Citizens’ Council gewesen zu sein. Doch durch seine zahlreichen Auftritte und Reden in den Versammlungen war gerade er es, der dem WCC eine Stimme gab und seinen Zuhörern immer wieder einhämmerte: “There is nothing in the U.S. Constitution or the amendments there too, that gives to Congress, the President or the Supreme Court the right or power to declare that white and colored children must attend the same schools.” („In der Verfassung der Vereinigten Staaten und ihren Zusätzen steht nichts geschrieben, was dem Kongress, dem Präsidenten oder dem Obersten Gerichtshof das Recht oder die Macht gibt zu erklären, dass weiße und farbige Kinder in dieselbe Schule gehen sollen.“) Unterzeichner des „Southern Manifesto“ 1956 war Eastland einer der 96 Unterzeichner des so genannten „Southern Manifesto“ („Manifest der Südstaaten“ vom 12. März 1956). Mit diesem „Manifest“ versuchten insgesamt 96 Politiker (19 Senatoren und 77 Mitglieder des Repräsentantenhauses) aus Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas und Virginia die oben genannten Entscheidungen des US-Supreme Courts wieder auszuhebeln. Eastland und die anderen Unterzeichner des „Southern Manifesto“ vermochten diese Entwicklung nicht zu akzeptieren. Anhänger McCarthys 1953 wurde Eastland zum Vorsitzenden des Judiciary Committee’s Internal Security Subcommittee (Unter-Ausschuss für Innere Sicherheit des Justizausschusses des Senats) (SISS) ernannt. Eastlands Vorgänger in diesem Amt war Senator Pat McCarran gewesen. McCarran war einer der Hauptinitiatoren des Internal Security Act (Gesetz zur Inneren Sicherheit) (auch als McCarran Act bezeichnet) aus dem Jahre 1950 und des Immigration and Nationality Act von 1952 (auch als McCarran-Walter-Gesetz bezeichnet). Infolge dieser Gesetze begannen mehrere Unter-Ausschüsse des Kongresses Vergangenheit und Privatleben von Regierungsbeamten und Personen anderer Lebensbereiche auf ihre Loyalität bzw. vermutete/unterstellte Spionagetätigkeit hin zu überprüfen. Das gleich im Jahre 1950 gebildete Internal Security Subcommitte war eines davon. McCarran war dessen allerersten Vorsitzender (und so wurde dieser Unter-Ausschuss auch als McCarran-Ausschuss bezeichnet). Durch die Wandlungen der außenpolitischen Landschaft in der Frühphase des so genannten Kalten Krieges und den damit analog einhergehenden innenpolitischen Veränderungen in den USA, vor allem durch den zunehmenden Einfluss Joseph McCarthys, erfuhr dieser Unter-Ausschuss des Senats eine kontinuierliche Ausweitung seines Tätigkeitsbereichs. McCarthy hatte als Vorsitzender des Senate Committee on Government Operations (GOC) bereits das Senates Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (Ständiger Unter-Ausschuss des Senats für Untersuchungen) für seine Kommunistenhatz instrumentalisiert. In der Folge machte er – unisono mit Eastland - seinen Einfluss auch auf den Unter-Ausschuss des Justizausschusses des Senats geltend, und so entwickelte sich auch dieser entwickelte sich zu einer Art Senats-Version des Komitee für unamerikanische Umtriebe (House Committee on Un-American Activities) des Repräsentantenhauses. In der Folge wurden u.a. die Finanzen des Außen- und Verteidigungsministeriums, angeblich kommunistisch eingefärbte Entscheidungen des Supreme Court, die US-Außenpolitik in Asien, Radio-, Fernsehsender, weite Teile der Unterhaltungsindustrie, Zeitungen (wie die New York Times), Jugendgruppen, Gewerkschaften, Bildungsorganisationen, die Rüstungsindustrie, Bürgerrechtsgruppen, Studentenorganisationen - letztlich sämtliche irgendwo vermuteten sowjetischen Aktionen innerhalb der Vereinigten Staaten – untersucht. In fast allen Fällen handelte es sich um an den Haaren herbeigezogene, haltlose Unterstellungen. Kaum ein überzeugter Kommunist wurde entdeckt, aber zahlreiche Untersuchte verloren Arbeitsplatz und Einkommen. Denn auch ein völlig Unschuldiger wurde durch die entehrenden Umstände der Untersuchungen stigmatisiert. Im Jahre 1956 konnte Eastland seinen Einfluss nochmals entscheidend vergrößern, als er Vorsitzender des Justizausschusses des Senats wurde. Dieser Ausschuss kontrollierte rund 60 Prozent aller vom Senat verabschiedeten Gesetze; vor allem war es ihm so möglich – als „ex officio member“ – sämtliche Unterausschüsse zu beeinflussen. In seiner Eigenschaft als Vorsitzender des SISS ließ Eastland u.a. einige Journalisten der New York Times vor seinen Ausschuss vorladen. Die NYT hatte in zahlreichen Titel-Storys gefordert, dass (auch) Mississippi die Entscheidung des Obersten Gerichtshofs in der Sache Brown vs. Board of Education zu akzeptieren habe und Maßnahmen zur Gleichstellung der Rassen treffen müsse. In einem am 5. Januar 1956 erschienenen Artikel schrieb die NYT: “Our faith is strong that long after Senator Eastland and his present subcommittee are gone, long after segregation has lost its final battle in the South, long after all that was known as McCarthyism is a dim, unwelcome memory, long after the last Congressional committee has learned that it cannot tamper successfully with a free press, The New York Times will be speaking for (those) who make it, and only for (those) who make it, and speaking, without fear or favor, the truth as it sees it.” „Wir sind der festen Überzeugung, dass noch lange Zeit nachdem Senator Eastland und sein gegenwärtiger Unter-Ausschuss schon der Vergangenheit angehören, lange Zeit nachdem die Rassentrennung in den Südstaaten ihre letzte Schlacht verloren hat, lange Zeit nachdem all das, was unter der Bezeichnung McCarthy-Ära bekannt ist, nur mehr eine schwache, unerwünschte Erinnerung ist, lange Zeit nachdem auch noch der letzte Kongress-Ausschuss begriffen hat, dass es vollkommen aussichtslos ist, an der freien Presse herumzufrisieren, die NYT (immer noch) für diejenigen sprechen wird, die diese Zeitung ausmachen und zwar ausschließlich für diejenigen, die diese Zeitung ausmachen. Und sie wird - furchtlos und objektiv – (weiterhin) die Wahrheit aussprechen.“ |
G;|Horst Wagner (* 17. Mai 1906 in Posen; † 13. März 1977 in Hamburg) war ein deutscher Diplomat im Dritten Reich. Er wurde vor allem bekannt als Leiter der für „Judenangelegenheiten“ zuständigen Referatsgruppe „Inland II“ im Auswärtigen Amt sowie als Verbindungsmann zwischen dem nationalsozialistischen Reichsaußenminister Joachim von Ribbentrop und dem Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler. In diesen Funktionen war Wagner für Judendeportationen und Kriegsverbrechen mitverantwortlich. Er war Mitorganisator der propagandistischen Zurückweisung einer als Feldscher-Aktion bezeichneten Initiative vom Mai 1943 zur Rettung Tausender jüdischer Kinder und gilt als Initiator der Tagung der Judenreferenten in Krummhübel im April 1944. Der strafrechtlichen Verfolgung entzog er sich zunächst durch Flucht nach Südamerika und später durch systematische Verschleppung der gegen ihn anhängigen Strafverfahren.  Jugend, Ausbildung und frühe Jahre Wagners Vater Johannes stammte aus einer Offiziersfamilie und war zum Zeitpunkt der Geburt seines Sohnes Horst Militärbeamter in Posen. Nach dem Besuch eines Realgymnasiums in Berlin-Steglitz, das er 1923 ohne Abitur verließ, begann er ein Volontariat bei einer Berliner Exportfirma, das er bereits nach sechs Monaten beendete. Nachdem ihm von einer Prüfungskommission des Reichserziehungsministeriums nachträglich die Hochschulreife zuerkannt worden war, studierte Wagner Geschichte und Völkerrecht an der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin. Außerdem belegte er einige Kurse an der Deutschen Hochschule für Politik. Eigenen Angaben zufolge studierte Wagner seit 1925 mit Unterbrechungen an der Deutschen Hochschule für Leibesübungen und erwarb dort 1929 ein Diplom, was sein Biograf Sebastian Weitkamp als Fälschung entlarvte. In den Jahren 1930 bis 1936 zeichnete Wagner mit dem Namen Horst M. Wagner als Sportjournalist und freier Mitarbeiter für verschiedene Verlage und Zeitungen, unter anderem für Ullstein, das Berliner Tageblatt und Wolffs Telegraphenbüro. In dieser Funktion unternahm er zahlreiche Auslandsreisen, um von sportlichen Wettkämpfen und über die internationalen Sportbeziehungen zu berichten. In einer Vernehmung von 1947 gab er an, damals „wohl mit einer der bekanntesten Namen der Sportpresse“ gewesen zu sein, was von anderen Journalisten in Abrede gestellt wurde. Zudem stellte sich Wagner, obwohl er nur ein drittklassiger Tennisspieler war, „gegen Entgelt als Tennispartner zur Verfügung“. Er lernte beim Tennisclub Rot-Weiß Berlin seine spätere Frau Irmgard kennen; sie heirateten 1935 in Cottbus. 1931 war Wagner zusätzlich für ein Dreivierteljahr beim Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen angestellt, wo er mit der Bearbeitung von Jahrbüchern und Sportabzeichen befasst war. Um 1935 war Wagner – der Französisch, Englisch und zumindest in Grundzügen Spanisch beherrschte – außerdem für einige Monate in der Abteilung „Ziviler Luftschutz“ des Reichsluftfahrtministeriums als Lektor und Dolmetscher für ausländische Zeitungen tätig. Laufbahn im Diplomatischen Dienst des NS-Staates Seit Anfang 1936 bemühte sich Wagner um eine Anstellung im Auswärtigen Amt, wo er auf die Anwärterliste gesetzt wurde. Ersatzweise bewarb er sich bei der Dienststelle Ribbentrop, dem Auswärtigen Büro der NSDAP, wo er zunächst abgelehnt worden sein will – angeblich weil er weder der Partei noch einer Parteiorganisation angehörte und weil sein Vater Vorstand einer Berliner Freimaurerloge gewesen war. Im Vorfeld der Olympischen Spiele von 1936 wurde Wagner dann vom Leiter des England-Referats in der Dienststelle Ribbentrop, Karlfried Graf Dürckheim, angeboten, während der Spiele die Betreuung prominenter englischer Gäste zu übernehmen. Nachdem er dieses Angebot angenommen hatte, trat er zum 1. Mai 1936 als Internationaler Sportattaché in das Ribbentrop-Büro ein. Da er während der Olympischen Spiele erfolgreich bekannte englische Persönlichkeiten wie Lord Beaverbrook betreut hatte, blieb Wagner auch anschließend als Begleiter für englische Gäste im Büro tätig. Später wurde er im Referat England und im für Presse- und Archivarbeiten zuständigen Hauptreferat VI beschäftigt. In seiner Nürnberger Vernehmung vom 19. Juni 1947 gab Wagner hierzu an, er sei 1937 beauftragt worden, „die deutsch-englischen Hefte zu gründen und als Hauptschriftleiter zu leiten“, eine zweisprachige Zeitschrift der Dienststelle Ribbentrop in Zusammenarbeit mit der Britischen Botschaft in Berlin, die, so Wagner, „von mir herausgegeben im deutschen Verlag für Deutschland bestimmt“ gewesen sei. Sechs Ausgaben dieser Zeitschrift seien erschienen. Sein Biograph Sebastian Weitkamp erwähnt in diesem Zusammenhang nur, Wagner habe Mitte 1937 versucht, die Leitung der Deutsch-Englischen Gesellschaft zu übernehmen. Dieser Versuch sei aber gescheitert. Nach der Ernennung Ribbentrops zum Reichsaußenminister am 4. Februar 1938 folgte Wagner diesem im Februar 1938 ins Auswärtige Amt, wo er zunächst als Wissenschaftlicher Hilfsarbeiter in der Protokollabteilung unter Alexander von Dörnberg tätig war. Seine Aufgaben dort umfassten unter anderem die Vorbereitung von Staatsempfängen, Danksagungen, Einladungen, Geschenk-Angelegenheiten, Glückwunschtelegramme. 1939 wurde Wagner dem Persönlichen Stab des Reichsaußenministers zugeteilt. In dieser Position wurde er 1940 zum Legationsrat, 1943 zum Vortragenden Legationsrat ernannt. Von 1940 bis 1945 war Wagner zudem mit der Leitung des zum Auswärtigen Amt gehörenden Gestüts Wiesenhof beauftragt. „Verbindungsführer“ zwischen Ribbentrop und Himmler Wagner trat 1937 in die NSDAP (Mitgliedsnr. 5.387.042) ein, nachdem er im Jahr zuvor in die SS aufgenommen worden war, wo er am 1. Januar 1944 bis zum SS-Standartenführer aufstieg. Während Wagner gegenüber seinem Trauzeugen und seiner Frau als Motivation für seinen Dienst im Auswärtigen Amt angab, es sei schon immer sein Ideal gewesen, Diplomat zu werden, sieht sein Biograph Weitkamp ihn eher als Opportunisten, der mit seinem Anschluss an Ribbentrop unter allen Umständen und mit größtem Anpassungsverhalten seine letzte berufliche Chance ergreifen wollte. Seine mangelnden beruflichen Qualifikationen habe er durch zuverlässige Gefolgschaft zur NS-Ideologie auszugleichen versucht und sich durch seine „Zugehörigkeit zu einer NS-Organisation, insbesondere zur aufstrebenden SS, einen bedeutsamen Karriereschub“ versprochen. Wagner fungierte bis Kriegsende als Leiter der Gruppe „Inland II“ des Auswärtigen Amtes, in der vier, ab Spätsommer 1944 fünf Referate zusammengefasst wurden. Die Aufgaben dieser Referate reichten von der Rekrutierung volksdeutscher „Freiwilliger“ für die Waffen-SS in Südosteuropa über den Einbau ausgewählter SD-Agenten und Judenreferenten in diplomatische Missionen bis zur diplomatischen Absicherung der Vorbereitung und Durchführung antijüdischer Maßnahmen in Südosteuropa, ab 1944 vor allem in Ungarn. Zudem wurde er im April/Mai 1943 zunächst von Ribbentrop zum Verbindungsführer des Auswärtigen Amtes zur SS berufen und dann im Gegenzug von Himmler zu seinem alleinigen Verbindungsführer zum Auswärtigen Amt bestimmt. Wagners auf dieser doppelten Beauftragung basierende Verbindungstätigkeit bestand vor allem in der wechselseitigen Übermittlung und Koordination der Wünsche und Anregungen Himmlers bzw. Ribbentrops sowie in der Durchsetzung der zwischen beiden Ressortchefs abgestimmten außenpolitischen und judenfeindlichen Maßnahmen. „Feldscher-Aktion“ 1943 und Tagung der „Judenreferenten“ in Krummhübel 1944 Als der Schweizer Gesandte Peter Anton Feldscher am 12. Mai 1943 im Auftrag der britischen Regierung beim Auswärtigen Amt anfragte, ob Bereitschaft bestünde, 5000 jüdische Kinder aus dem deutschen Herrschaftsbereich nach Palästina ausreisen zu lassen, ließ Wagner von dem ihm unterstellten Judenreferenten des Auswärtigen Amtes Eberhard von Thadden für die Gruppe Inland II eine von ihm selbst unterstützte und von verschiedenen Abteilungsleitern des Auswärtigen Amtes gebilligte propagandistische Zurückweisung dieses Rettungsversuches ausarbeiten, der im Amtsjargon als Feldscher-Aktion bezeichnet wurde. Laut Urteilstext des Wilhelmstraßen-Prozesses vom 11. April 1949 unterschrieb Wagner eine auf den 25. Juni 1943 datierte und von Thadden verfasste Denkschrift, die als Grundlage für die spätere propagandistische Zurückweisung diente. Danach sollte sich: Ende 1943 beauftragte Ribbentrop Wagner mit dem Aufbau einer zentralen antijüdischen Propagandastelle im Auswärtigen Amt, die zunächst als „Informationsstelle X“ gegründet, schließlich als „Informationsstelle XIV (Antijüdische Auslandsaktion)“ fungierte. In ihr arbeiteten als Vertreter des Reichssicherheitshauptamtes SS-Hauptsturmführer Heinz Ballensiefen und SS-Untersturmführer Georg Heuchert mit. Wagner bestimmte Rudolf Schleier, der vorher an der deutschen Botschaft Paris tätig gewesen war, zu seinem Vertreter für die Leitung dieser „Informationsstelle“, welche die „antijüdische Propaganda im Ausland zentral leiten“ sollte, unter anderem mittels zentraler Sammlung und Verteilung antijüdischer Texte, dem Aufbau eines „Jüdischen und Antijüdischen Archivs des Auswärtigen Amtes“ sowie der Planung entsprechender Tagungen. Im Januar 1944 schlug Wagner vor, eine Arbeitstagung einzuberufen, an der die Judenreferenten der Auslandsmissionen des Auswärtigen Amtes und die „Arisierungsberater“ der SS teilnehmen sollten, um ihre Kooperation zu verbessern, denn es stelle sich, so Wagner, die Er erbat die Zustimmung Ribbentrops zu seinem Vorschlag, die dieser erteilte, so dass Die Tagung fand am 3. und 4. April in dem niederschlesischen Ort Krummhübel als Auftakt für eine „Antijüdische Aktionsstelle“ oder „Antijüdische Auslandsaktion“ statt. Franz Alfred Six forderte hier die „physische Beseitigung der Ostjuden“, wie Thadden protokollierte. Weitere bekannte Teilnehmer der Aktion waren Harald Leithe-Jasper, Adolf Mahr, Gustav Richter, Heinz Ballensiefen, Hans-Otto Meissner als Konsul in Italien, Peter Klassen, Paris und Hans Hagemeyer. Verbrechen gegen amerikanische Kriegsgefangene und den französischen General Mesny Nach einem Bericht der Berliner Zeitung wurden im Jahr 2010 Stasi-Unterlagen aus den 1970er Jahren gefunden, die Wagner erheblich belasten: Demnach hatte er an Kriegsverbrechen gegen amerikanische Kriegsgefangene mitgewirkt, indem er auf Wunsch Ribbentrops deren völkerrechtswidrige Verurteilung zum Tode in die Wege leitete. Wagner vermerkte für Ribbentrop am 31. Dezember 1944: Wagners Bericht zufolge seien vom 28. bis zum 30. Dezember 1944 bereits zehn US-Soldaten zum Tode verurteilt worden, ein weiteres Todesurteil liege vor. Drei Tage später war Ribbentrops Wunsch vollständig erfüllt, dank des Einsatzes der verantwortlichen Beamten, die für das Kriegsverbrechen sogar ihren Weihnachtsurlaub unterbrochen hatten. Wagner bat Ribbentrop am 3. Januar 1945 zufrieden um eine Belobigung: Ribbentrop schlug vor, den Verantwortlichen sollten „gelegentlich […] einige anerkennende Worte […] im Namen des Herrn RAM mündlich in geeignet erscheinender Weise“ ausgesprochen werden. Als persönlicher Verbindungsmann Himmlers und Ribbentrops war Wagner an den Planungen zur Ermordung des französischen Generals Gustave Mesny beteiligt, der sich in deutscher Kriegsgefangenschaft befand. Die Ermordung eines französischen Generals wurde von Adolf Hitler gefordert, nachdem im Oktober 1944 der deutsche General Fritz von Brodowski, einer der Verantwortlichen für das Massaker von Oradour, unter ungeklärten Umständen in französischer Kriegsgefangenschaft von der FFI bei einem Fluchtversuch erschossen worden war. In Kooperation zwischen Reichssicherheitshauptamt, dem Chef des Kriegsgefangenenwesens und dem Auswärtigen Amt wurde Mesny als Opfer ausgewählt und während eines Transports bei einer fingierten Autopanne von SS-Leuten erschossen. Wagner sorgte im Auftrag Ribbentrops zusammen mit der Rechtsabteilung des Auswärtigen Amtes dafür, dass das Verbrechen so geplant wurde, dass es notfalls völkerrechtlich kaschiert werden konnte. Nachkriegszeit Zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs wurde Wagner zusammen mit einigen anderen Diplomaten im österreichischen Bad Gastein von amerikanischen Truppen festgesetzt und mittels Sammeltransport in ein Gefängnis nach Salzburg gebracht. Aufgrund des Systems des Automatischen Arrests für Funktionsträger aus Partei und Staat wurde er „in die amerikanische Besatzungszone verlegt“ und schließlich „nach einer Odyssee durch alliierte Lager am 28. August 1946 nach Nürnberg gebracht“. In der Nürnberger Haft lernte Wagner 1947, so der Historiker Ernst Piper, die als „wichtige Zeugin im Prozess gegen das SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt“ festgehaltene Emilie Edelmann kennen, mit der er bis 1954 eine Liebesbeziehung pflegte. Deren Tochter, die Schriftstellerin Gisela Heidenreich, hat in einer Mischung von realer Spurensuche und literarischer Darstellung die Geschichte Wagners als NS-Täter und Geliebter ihrer Mutter dargestellt. Da Aktenfunde nach dem Krieg den Anteil der leitenden Beamten des Auswärtigen Amtes und insbesondere von Wagners Referatsgruppe „Inland II“ an den Verfolgungsmaßnahmen gegen die europäischen Juden offenbarten, sollte gegen ihn im Wilhelmstraßen-Prozess Anklage erhoben werden. Als die Liste der Angeklagten um Mitglieder anderer Dienststellen mit Sitz in der Wilhelmstraße erweitert wurde, strich man Wagners Namen. Stattdessen wurde er nun als Zeuge geführt und von Robert Kempner vernommen. In erster Linie wurde er zur Ermordung General Mesnys befragt und gab Himmler, Hitler und Ribbentrop die Schuld. Zu seiner Rolle als Leiter der Gruppe Inland II bei den Judenverfolgungen verhört, „charakterisierte er sich selbst als Postboten, der nur Mitteilungen überbracht habe“. In den Zeugenstand des Wilhelmstraßen-Prozesses trat Wagner am 3. März 1948. Kempner erhoffte sich aufgrund dessen genauer Kenntnisse des Vorgangs eine belastbare Aussage Wagners gegen den Angeklagten Karl Ritter, Botschafter zur besonderen Verwendung beim Auswärtigen Amt. Ritter wurde im Unterschied zu Wagner wegen seiner Beteiligung an den Planungen zur Ermordung Mesnys angeklagt, da er für „die Überwachung der Ausführung des Mordauftrages“ verantwortlich war. Doch Wagner erwies sich als Zeuge der Anklage wertlos. Hingegen gelang es Ritters Verteidiger Erich Schmidt-Leichner in dieser Sache, „Wagner als den eigentlich Verantwortlichen darzustellen“. Um Weihnachten 1947 wurde Wagner in das Internierungslager Nürnberg-Langwasser verlegt, in dem auch Personen festgehalten wurden, die später der deutschen Justiz überstellt werden sollten. Für solche Fälle von zu erwartenden Prozessen, welche die Amerikaner nicht mehr unter eigener Regie durchführen wollten, gründeten sie im Rahmen ihrer Ermittlungsbehörde Office of Chief of Counsel For War Crimes (OCCWC) eine Überleitungsabteilung mit der Bezeichnung Special Projects Division, mit der sie noch ausstehende Verfahren in deutsche Zuständigkeiten überführen wollten. Dabei wurde Wagner unter den voraussichtlich künftig Anzuklagenden in der „höchsten Gruppe A“ geführt. Im Juli 1948 stellte ein Bericht der „Special Projects Division“ fest, dass sich Wagner und Thadden bei den Judendeportationen aus der Slowakei, Kroatien, Bulgarien, Ungarn, Rumänien und den Niederlanden strafbar gemacht hatten, weil sie „die SS-Maßnahmen vollauf gebilligt“ hätten. Am 11. August 1948 ermächtigte das OMGUS die deutschen Gerichte, in der Strafsache gegen Franz Rademacher, Wagner, von Thadden und Karl Klingenfuß die Gerichtsbarkeit auszuüben. Wagner floh am 25. August 1948 „aus dem schwach bewachten Lager“, gelangte über eine der Rattenlinien nach Italien und schließlich nach Südamerika. 1952 kehrte Wagner unter falschem Namen als Korrespondent argentinischer Zeitungen nach Italien zurück. Nach seiner Enttarnung wurde ihm dort der Prozess gemacht; ein italienischer Appellationsgerichtshof entschied 1958, ihn nicht an Deutschland auszuliefern. Ende 1958 kam er freiwillig in die Bundesrepublik. Eine gerichtliche Voruntersuchung in Essen begann. Wagner saß rund 15 Monate in Haft, bis im März 1960 das Oberlandesgericht Hamm ihn gegen Kaution entließ. Die Anklageschrift der Staatsanwaltschaft Essen (AZ 29 Ks 4/67) datiert 22. Februar 1967. Der erste Tag der Hauptverhandlung war für den 20. Mai 1968 beim Landgericht Essen terminiert; es wurde Anklage gegen ihn wegen Beihilfe zum Mord an 356.624 Juden erhoben. Ein Prozess gegen den anfänglich von Ernst Achenbach verteidigten Wagner kam nicht zustande: Achenbach legte, nachdem eine Verschiebung des Verfahrens nicht gelang, als „einkalkulierte Notbremse“ am 8. Mai 1968 das Mandat nieder und Wagners neue Rechtsvertreter Hans Laternser und Fritz Steinacker mussten sich in die Akten einarbeiten. Nach Laternsers plötzlichem Tod übernahm Fritz Steinacker, der noch in einem anderen NS-Verfahren beschäftigt war, alleine die 20 Bände Akten und 20.000 Dokumente. Immer neue Krankmeldungen – bestätigt unter anderem durch Gutachten des Hamburger Psychiaters Hans Bürger-Prinz – verschleppten das Verfahren, bis es 1974 wegen Verhandlungsunfähigkeit des Angeklagten vorläufig eingestellt wurde. Ein Ende fand es mit Wagners Tod am 13. März 1977. Der Nürnberger Ankläger Robert Kempner, der an diesem Verfahren gegen Wagner als Nebenkläger beteiligt war, schrieb im Rückblick 1978 an den damaligen Bundesjustizminister Hans-Jochen Vogel: |
G;|Hugh Caswell Tremenheere Dowding, 1. Baron Dowding (* 24. April 1882 in Moffat, Schottland; † 15. Februar 1970 in Tunbridge Wells, Grafschaft Kent) war Offizier in der Royal Air Force (RAF) und während der Luftschlacht um England Kommandant des RAF Fighter Command (Jagdwaffe). Er war Träger des Order of the Bath, Royal Victorian Order und Order of St. Michael and St. George. Mit dem so genannten „Dowding-System“, einem Luftverteidigungskonzept basierend auf Radar, zentraler Informationsverarbeitung und mittels Sprechfunk geführter Abfangjäger, schuf Dowding die Voraussetzungen für die Verteidigung Englands im Zweiten Weltkrieg.  Schule und Erster Weltkrieg In seiner Heimatstadt Moffat besuchte Hugh Dowding die St. Ninian's Preparatory School, die von seinem Vater Arthur Dowding und dessen Studienkollegen, Reverend Churchill 1879 gegründet worden war. In seinem 15. Lebensjahr wurde er auf Empfehlung seines Vaters in das renommierte südenglische Winchester College aufgenommen. Da sein Desinteresse an Griechisch und Latein seinen schulischen Erfolg dort verhinderte, verließ er das Institut schon zwei Jahre später wieder. Er bewarb sich mit Erfolg an der Royal Military Academy in Woolwich. Aufgrund seiner Abneigung gegenüber Mathematik wurde er jedoch nicht zum Ingenieursstudium zugelassen. Dem Rat seiner Familie folgend, ging er zunächst zur Royal Garrison Artillery. Als Artillerist erwartete Dowding, nach Südafrika entsandt zu werden, da England sich seit 1899 im Krieg mit den Buren befand. Er wurde jedoch nicht dort, sondern nacheinander in Ceylon, Gibraltar, Hongkong und Indien stationiert, wo er bei der Gebirgsartillerie diente. 1912 kehrte er nach England zurück und besuchte das Staff College der British Army in Camberley. Während seiner Zeit dort erwarb er privat die Fluglizenz (Royal Aero Club pilot's certificate No. 711), die er am 20. Dezember 1913 erhielt, seinem letzten Tag am Staff College. Daraufhin trat er gegen den Willen seines Vaters als Reserveoffizier in das neu gegründete Royal Flying Corps ein. Im Ersten Weltkrieg kämpfte Dowding zunächst bei der 6. und der 9. Squadron. Sein frühes Interesse für die drahtlose Telegraphie ließ ihn vorübergehend nach England zurückkehren und das Wireless Experimental Establishment in Brookland gründen. Wieder an der Front in Frankreich, wurde er zum Kommandeur der 16. Squadron ernannt. Auf einen Vorfall während dieser Zeit soll sein späterer Spitzname Stuffy zurückgehen. Angeblich beschwerte sich Dowding bei einem Vorgesetzten darüber, dass junge, unzureichend ausgebildete Piloten seiner Staffel gegen die erfahrenen Deutschen eingesetzt wurden und dabei oft den Tod fanden. Die legendäre Antwort war: „Don’t be stuffy, Dowding!“ (deutsch: „Sei nicht umständlich, Dowding!“) Während der Schlacht an der Somme im Jahr 1916 führte er mehrere Squadrons als einen großen Verband (headquarter wing) an. Meinungsverschiedenheiten mit Autoritäten wie Oberbefehlshaber Hugh Trenchard führten jedoch zu seiner Abberufung von der Front bis zum Kriegsende. Dowding beendete den Ersten Weltkrieg im Rang eines Brigadier-Generals. Zwischenkriegszeit Im Februar 1918 heiratete Dowding Clarice Maude Vancourt. Sie war die Cousine eines Staffelkameraden der 6. Squadron, der sie einander bekannt gemacht hatte. Clarice Maude brachte ihre Tochter Marjorie Brenda aus erster Ehe mit in die Familie und Dowding nahm sie als Stieftochter an. Am 9. Januar 1919 kam ihr gemeinsamer Sohn Derek Dowding zur Welt. Als Clarice Maud Dowding 1920 nach nur zwei Jahren Ehe unerwartet starb, übersiedelte Hugh ins Haus seines Vaters nach Wimbledon. Seine Schwester Hilda übernahm für Dowding vermutlich die Sorge um seinen Sohn und repräsentative Pflichten, als seine Karriere bei der RAF fortschritt. Derek besuchte das Winchester College und später das RAF Elite-College in Cranwell, wo auch der populäre Jagdflieger Douglas Bader ausgebildet wurde. Dowding war ein ausgezeichneter Skiläufer, Slalomchampion und Präsident des englischen Skiklubs von 1924 bis 1925. Dowding trat in die neue Royal Air Force (RAF) ein, in der er ab 1929 den Rang eines Air Vice-Marshal bekleidete (Rangordnung siehe: Luftmarschall). Darauf folgte 1933 die Beförderung zum Air Marshal und 1934 die Erhebung in den Ritterstand. In den 1930er Jahren war er Mitglied der Abteilung für Forschung und Entwicklung innerhalb der RAF und setzte sich für die Umstellung von Doppeldeckern auf Eindecker in Ganzmetallbauweise ein. Damit forcierte er eine Modernisierung des Flugzeugbestandes auf die Modelle Hawker Hurricane und Supermarine Spitfire. Dowding war in dieser Funktion auch Zeuge eines Versuches zur Ortung von Flugzeugen, durchgeführt von dem schottischen Techniker Robert Watson-Watt, am 26. Februar 1935. Das Ergebnis dieser Tests überzeugte Stuffy Dowding, der auch für seine Steifheit und Humorlosigkeit bekannt war, derart, dass er Steuergelder für die Weiterentwicklung dieser Technik bereitstellen ließ. Er förderte damit die Entwicklung der Funkortung, die später ein wesentlicher Bestandteil des Dowding-Systems war. Anders als er erwartet hatte, wurde 1936 nicht er, sondern Cyril Newall in den Stab der Royal Air Force berufen. Stattdessen wurde er nur zum Oberkommandeur der neu aufgestellten Jägerverbände, des Fighter Command, ernannt. Auch sein Sohn Derek wurde Kampfpilot und diente während der Luftschlacht um England bei der 74. Squadron. Das väterliche Verhältnis zu seinen fighter boys, wie er die Piloten gelegentlich nannte, hatte also auch einen familiären Hintergrund. Zweiter Weltkrieg Politik Dowdings Aufmerksamkeit galt angesichts der unübersehbaren deutschen Rüstungsanstrengungen und der militärischen Erfolge der Wehrmacht dem raschen Aufbau einer starken Jagdwaffe. Um dafür Zeit zu gewinnen, bestärkte er den britischen Premierminister Arthur Neville Chamberlain in seiner Appeasement-Politik. Dowding war bereits 1939 für die altersbedingte Pensionierung vorgesehen. Der als Nachfolger bestellte Christopher Courtney verunglückte jedoch bei einem Flugunfall zusammen mit anderen hohen Offizieren der RAF und verletzte sich schwer. Dowding stimmte einer Verlängerung seiner Dienstzeit bis März 1940, und dann weiter bis Oktober 1940 zu. Während der Schlacht um Frankreich wurden immer mehr Squadrons auf das Festland überstellt und in den Kämpfen gegen eine schnell vorrückende deutsche Wehrmacht aufgerieben. Der energische Winston Churchill, der nach dem Rücktritt Chamberlains Premierminister war, wollte den Forderungen der Franzosen nach weiteren Jagdstaffeln der RAF nachgeben, damit die Franzosen den Krieg gegen Deutschland fortführten. Dowdings Ansinnen war es jedoch, die Reserven der RAF zu schonen und für die Heimatverteidigung vorzubereiten. Da erhielt Dowding die Gelegenheit, bei einer Besprechung am 15. Mai 1940 dem Kriegskabinett und Winston Churchill seine Sicht zu erläutern. Er beschrieb anschaulich, dass bei konstanter Verlustrate in Kürze keine einzige Hurricane mehr zur Verteidigung vorhanden sein würde. Churchill betonte, dass er persönlich der französischen Regierung Unterstützung versprochen habe, und dass sie dringend nach Jägerstaffeln verlange. Dowding gab sich demonstrativ unbeteiligt und verwies darauf, dass seine Aufgabe die Vorbereitung des Fighter Command auf die Verteidigung Englands sei. Am nächsten Tag schrieb Dowding an Churchill, dass er unverzüglich eine Stellungnahme des Luftfahrtministeriums fordere, die zuvor die Mindeststärke des Fighter Command zur Landesverteidigung auf 52 Squadrons festgelegt habe. Eine voll ausgerüstete Squadron des Fighter Command verfügte über durchschnittlich je 20 Flugzeuge mit Mannschaft und Wartung, was in etwa einer Staffel der deutschen Luftwaffe entsprach. Gegenwärtig wären noch 36 Squadrons einsatzbereit, erläuterte Dowding. Man solle ihm von Seiten der Politik eine Mindeststärke nennen, die in keinem Fall unterschritten werden würde. Er vermied sorgfältig, die genannten 52 Squadrons als seine persönliche Mindestforderung zu nennen und spielte geschickt den Ball der Politik zu. Danach genehmigte das Kriegskabinett unter dem Druck der schwer in Bedrängnis geratenen französischen Führung noch ein letztes Mal vier (statt der geforderten zehn) Squadrons für das britische Expeditionskorps in Frankreich. In Folge wollte niemand mehr die Verantwortung für eine Schwächung der Heimatverteidigung übernehmen. Alle weiteren verzweifelten Gesuche der Franzosen wurden abgewiesen. Winston Churchill erklärte später, Dowding hätte ihm gegenüber im Vertrauen zugesichert, er benötige lediglich 25 Squadrons zur Heimatverteidigung, was Dowding stets bestritt und als Beweis dafür seinen Brief vom 16. Mai vorlegte. Als Dowding von der Unterzeichnung des Waffenstillstands zwischen Frankreich und Deutschland erfuhr, bemerkte er lapidar: „Finally alone“ (deutsch: „Schließlich [sind wir] alleine“). Im Mai war das Fighter Command auf 32 Squadrons reduziert. Unmittelbar nach dem Ende der Kämpfe in Frankreich begann zunächst über dem Ärmelkanal, dann zunehmend über der Insel die Luftschlacht um England. Am Vorabend des 18. August, an jenem Tag, da beide Seiten die schwersten Verluste hinnehmen mussten, standen bereits 62 Squadrons des Fighter Command zur Verteidigung bereit. Davon waren 53 mit Hurricanes und Spitfires ausgerüstet, alle einsatzbereiten Maschinen zusammengenommen 1065 Stück. Zusätzlich verfügte die RAF über 373 moderne und technisch einsatzbereite Maschinen in Wartungsbetrieben und Ausbildungseinheiten, die mit kurzer Vorwarnzeit zu den Staffeln gebracht werden konnten. Bis zum 31. Oktober nahmen 58 Squadrons des Fighter Command aktiv an der Luftschlacht teil. Ein wesentlicher Aspekt von Dowdings Strategie war der wirtschaftliche Umgang mit den zur Verfügung stehenden Reserven. Dies wurde zusätzlich von abgefangenen deutschen Funksprüchen unterstützt, aus denen hervorging, dass die Luftwaffenführung die RAF in einer großen Luftschlacht dezimieren wolle. Dowding ließ seinen Gruppenkommandeuren bei der Erfüllung ihrer Aufgaben weitgehend freie Hand. Es wurde aber auch kritisiert, dass er einer Rivalität zweier Gruppenkommandeure, nämlich Park und Leigh-Mallory, dadurch Raum für einen Disput über den Einsatz großer Verbände bot. Diese so genannte Big-Wing-Kontroverse wurde noch lange nach dem Krieg diskutiert. Aus heutiger Sicht wird das Vorgehen von Park, auf das Formieren großer und dadurch schwerfälliger Verbände in der kritischen Phase zu verzichten, als das richtige angesehen. Dünkirchen Als sich die British Expeditionary Force (britisches Expeditionskorps) Ende Mai und Anfang Juni 1940 vom Strand von Dünkirchen über den Ärmelkanal zurückzog und dabei heftig von der Luftwaffe attackiert wurde, kritisierte man in Soldatenkreisen das vermeintliche Fehlen der RAF. Man vermutete, dass Dowding die Jäger nicht opfern wollte, um den Rückzug der Truppen zu decken. Diese Einschätzung war falsch. So fanden heftige Luftkämpfe im Bereich von Dünkirchen statt, aber meist außerhalb der Sichtweite der bedrängten englischen und französischen Truppen. Die RAF beklagte den Verlust von mindestens 90 Piloten, es wurden mehr als 170 Jagdflugzeuge des Fighter Command abgeschossen oder irreparabel beschädigt. Aus Propagandagründen wurden diese hohen Verlustzahlen nicht veröffentlicht. Das erste Mal im Zweiten Weltkrieg erreichte die RAF, zeitlich und räumlich begrenzt, Luftüberlegenheit über die Luftwaffe. 134 deutsche Flugzeuge konnten in der bis dahin größten Luftschlacht abgeschossen werden. Obwohl die Ausgangslage für die Evakuierung ungünstig war, konnten 338.226 alliierte Soldaten nach England gebracht werden. Luftschlacht um England Die Luftschlacht um England wird von der Battle of Britain Historical Society (Gesellschaft für die Geschichte der Luftschlacht um England) in Übereinkunft mit der RAF zeitlich zwischen dem 10. Juli 1940 und dem 31. Oktober 1940 eingegrenzt. Es blieb wenig Zeit, die Verluste aus der Schlacht um Frankreich und Dünkirchen zu ersetzen. Um dem dringenden Personalbedarf zu begegnen, ließ Dowding ausländische Verbände mit mäßigen Englischkenntnissen von der RAF in den Kampf führen. Der Erfolg war durchschlagend, so waren beispielsweise die Abschussquoten der polnischen Piloten überdurchschnittlich hoch, wenn auch über mangelnde Funkdisziplin geklagt wurde. In der Hitze des Gefechtes kommunizierten die polnischen Piloten nämlich in ihrer Muttersprache und nicht in Englisch über die Bordfunkgeräte. Die heftigsten Kämpfe ereigneten sich zwischen dem Adlertag am 13. August und dem 17. September, als Hitler die „Operation Seelöwe“ bis auf unbestimmte Zeit aussetzte. Seelöwe war die Bezeichnung der geplanten Invasion Englands, deren Voraussetzung die Niederlage der RAF gewesen wäre. In dieser Phase der Luftschlacht musste die 11. Gruppe unter Führung von Keith Park die Hauptlast der Kämpfe tragen. Park war zuvor als Adjutant im Stab des Fighter Command direkter Untergebener Dowdings gewesen. Park genoss das absolute Vertrauen Dowdings und wurde sogar in die Ultra intercepts (abgefangene und entschlüsselte deutsche Funksprüche, deren Existenz strengster Geheimhaltung unterlag) eingeweiht. Dowding selbst wurde erst am 16. Oktober 1940 vom Geheimdienst auf die Liste der zu informierenden Personen gesetzt und erfuhr an diesem Tag offiziell von der Existenz des Ultra Projektes. Der Verlauf der Schlacht lässt darauf schließen, dass der Geheimdienst vereinzelt Informationen an Dowding weitergab, ohne die Quellen dafür zu nennen. Durch eine gesteigerte Flugzeugproduktionsrate, die von Dowding entscheidend mit entwickelte Luftverteidigung und dem tapferen Einsatz der Piloten und ihrer Kommandeure galt ab 31. Oktober 1940 die unmittelbare Bedrohung als abgewendet. Der Triumph Dowdings wurde von persönlichen Kontroversen zwischen Dowding, seinem Nachfolger William Sholto Douglas und zwei seiner rivalisierenden Kommandeure überschattet. Er wurde als Oberbefehlshaber des Fighter Command abberufen. Weiterer Einsatz Kaum war die unmittelbare Gefahr einer Niederlage gebannt, trat Dowding im November 1940 und auf Wunsch Churchills eine diplomatische Mission in die USA an, bei der er Präsident Franklin D. Roosevelt von der Bedeutung einer modernen Jagdwaffe überzeugen und beim Aufbau einer solchen Unterstützung leisten sollte. Anschließend wirkte er innerhalb der Royal Air Force an Verwaltungsaufgaben wie der Erhebung erforderlicher Mannstärken mit, bevor er im Juni 1942 als Air Chief Marshal (Generaloberst) den Ruhestand antrat. Als Kommandeure des Fighter Command folgten ihm William Sholto Douglas und später Trafford Leigh-Mallory nach. Am 5. Juli 1943 wurde er von König George VI. zum Baron Dowding of Bentley Priory in der Grafschaft Middlesex ernannt. Der Titel gehörte zur Peerage of the United Kingdom. Nachkriegszeit Am 25. September 1951 heiratete Dowding die Witwe Muriel Whiting in Caxton Hall Westminster. Sie lebten zusammen im selben Haus in Wimbledon, das Dowding schon vor dem Krieg bewohnt hatte. Lady Muriel Dowding gründete 1959 die Tierschutzorganisation Beauty Without Cruelty (BWC). Beide waren Vegetarier und Anti-Vivisektionalisten und widmeten sich unter anderem dem Spiritualismus und dem Tierschutz. Dowding war aufgrund seiner Popularität und seines hohen Adelsstandes ein häufig zitierter Redner in der parapsychologischen Szene Englands. In einem mehrfach publizierten Interview bestätigte er die Plausibilität der Existenz von UFOs außerirdischer Herkunft. Dowding vertrat die Ansicht, dass der Sieg der Alliierten gegen Hitler durch direktes göttliches Eingreifen ermöglicht wurde. In verschiedenen Publikationen ging Dowding auf die These der Reinkarnation ein. In diesem Zusammenhang berichtete er davon, dass ihm während der Luftschlacht von England gefallene Piloten erschienen seien und er sich mit ihnen unterhalten habe. Er schrieb neben Beiträgen für Journale auch Bücher, und zwar: Many Mansions. Rider & Co, London 1943 Lychgate. Rider & Co, London 1945 Twelve legions of angels: essays on war affected by air power and on the prevention of war. Jarrolds, London 1946 God's magic: an aspect of spiritualism. Museum Press, London 1946 The Dark Star. Museum Press, London 1951 Zurzeit wird keiner dieser Titel mehr verlegt. Dowding starb am 15. Februar 1970 in seinem Haus in Tunbridge Wells in der Grafschaft Kent. Seine Asche wurde vor dem Battle of Britain Memorial-Fenster der Westminster Abbey beigesetzt. Sein Sohn und einziges Kind Derek Hugh Tremenheere Dowding folgte ihm als 2. Baron Dowding. |
G;|Roland T. Rowland (geboren als Roland Walter Fuhrhop, bekannt geworden als Tiny Rowland; * 27. November 1917 in Belgaum, Indien; † 25. Juli 1998 in London, Großbritannien) war ein britischer Geschäftsmann und Tycoon deutscher Herkunft. Er machte sein Vermögen in den Minen Afrikas und baute das Konglomerat Lonrho auf, das nicht nur zahlreiche afrikanische Unternehmen, sondern unter anderem die britische Zeitung The Observer aufkaufte und sich unter seiner Leitung zu einer der größten und mächtigsten britischen Gesellschaften entwickelte. Zu einem internationalen Skandal und jahrelangen Konflikt kam es, als sich Tiny Rowland 1985 bei dem zum Verkauf stehenden renommierten Londoner Kaufhaus Harrods nicht gegen seinen früheren Freund und Geschäftspartner Mohamed Al-Fayed durchsetzen konnte und fortan mit aller Härte und Verbissenheit um die Rechtmäßigkeit dieses Geschäfts stritt. Die Fehde beherrschte den Rest seines Lebens und verschlang Unsummen an Geld; beendet wurde der Konflikt erst nach Rowlands Tod durch Al-Fayeds Zahlung einer hohen Geldsumme an Rowlands Witwe.   In den Nachkriegsjahren arbeitete Rowland zunächst für eine private Autovermietung, die von seinem schottischen Freund Eric Richard Smith in London betrieben wurde. Er war es, der Rowland veranlasste, 1948 nach Rhodesien, dem heutigen Simbabwe, zu gehen, um dort auf seiner Ranch, Luton Farm, in der Nähe von Gwelo (heute Gweru) zu arbeiten. Rowland erkannte die wirtschaftlichen Möglichkeiten, die Rhodesien damals zu bieten hatte, und begann umgehend, Bekanntschaften aufzubauen und Kontakte zu knüpfen. Die Freundschaft und die Zusammenarbeit mit Smith zerbrachen, als die Affäre zwischen Rowland und der Ehefrau seines Freundes, Irene Smith, bekannt wurde. Rowland erwarb eine Goldmine in der Nähe von Kanyemba, die er in eine Aktiengesellschaft einbrachte und ausbeutete. Nach vier Jahren musste sie stillgelegt werden, und Rowland wandte sich, zusammen mit einem neuen ungarischen Geschäftspartner, dem Import europäischer Kraftfahrzeuge, insbesondere Mercedes, zu. Gleichzeitig entwickelte er die Idee des Baus einer Öl-Pipeline nach Beira, Mozambiques Hafen, um Rhodesiens Abhängigkeit von Südafrika zu mildern – eine Idee, die er vielen Politikern, Investoren und Geschäftsleuten vortragen durfte, letztlich aber in den 1960er Jahren selbst verwirklichte. Ende der 1950er Jahre verfügte Rowland bereits über eine große Anzahl erstklassiger Kontakte in Afrika und dem Vereinigten Königreich, hatte ein kleines Vermögen angesammelt und sich eine repräsentative Farm in Gatooma zugelegt. Er wurde schnell zur lokalen Legende, als in seinem dortigen feudalen Haus die Frau des ehemaligen Freundes als Hausherrin für ihn „rauschende Feste“ ausrichtete. Bei seinen Geschäften hatte er auch Angus Ogilvy kennengelernt, der 1963 durch seine Heirat mit Prinzessin Alexandra von Kent, einer Cousine Königin Elisabeth II., zu einem Mitglied des britischen Königshauses wurde. Weiterhin war er in Kontakt mit der Rio Tinto Group gekommen, die gerade im Begriff war, die 1909 gegründete, durchaus respektable, aber mittlerweile heruntergewirtschaftete London and Rhodesian Mining and Land Company (Lonrho) zu kaufen, wo ihm eine Position angeboten wurde. So fand sich Rowland trotz seines „unkonventionellen Hintergrundes und seiner Schwierigkeiten mit dem britischen Establishment“ alsbald in der Position, als Managing Direktor (geschäftsführendes Vorstandsmitglied) eines britisch kontrollierten Unternehmens in höchsten Gesellschaftskreisen zu verkehren. London and Rhodesian Mining and Land Company Ogilvy war es gewesen, der Rowland 1961 für die London and Rhodesian Mining and Land Company (Lonrho, heute Lonmin) rekrutierte. Er war überzeugt, dass der 44-Jährige in der Lage sein würde, die Gesellschaft zu sanieren, und Rowland seinerseits war bereit für die große Herausforderung. Er machte so viel Geld wie möglich frei und beteiligte sich mit 48 Prozent an Lonrho, einer damals mittelgroßen unrentablen Viehfarm und Bergwerksgesellschaft, die er innerhalb weniger Jahre in ein millionenschweres internationales Konglomerat verwandelte. Das Unternehmen expandierte unter seiner Leitung sprunghaft und kaufte reihenweise angeschlagene Unternehmen aller möglichen Branchen, wie Gold- und Platinminen, Betriebe der Textil-, Agrar- und Lebensmittelindustrie und andere Geschäftszweige in mehr als 20 afrikanischen Ländern, aber auch Zeitungen, Hotels und Immobilieneigentum in Europa und den Vereinigten Staaten. Auf dem Gipfel des Erfolges betrieb Rowlands Konglomerat 800 Unternehmen in nahezu allen Branchen und machte in den 1980er Jahren Gewinne von jährlich 270 Millionen Pfund Sterling. Dabei kam ihm seine Fähigkeit, auf Menschen zuzugehen und schnell persönliche Kontakte zu schließen, zugute, wobei er insbesondere auf dem afrikanischen Kontinent rasch die Personen zu seinen Freunden zählte, die später politische oder unternehmerische Führungspositionen übernahmen. Er war dabei mit rechtsstehenden Autoritäten genauso befreundet wie mit sozialistischen Revolutionären; er war ein Vertrauter von Malawis Hastings Banda, Sambias Kenneth Kaunda, Kenias Daniel arap Moi und Zaïres Mobutu Sese Seko. Diese einflussträchtigen Allianzen, die er für seine Geschäftspläne nutzte, versetzten Rowland in die Lage, schnell ein Gewirr von in die Hunderten gehenden, einzeln operierenden Gesellschaften unter dem Dach der Lonrho zu etablieren. Allerdings genoss die Lonrho PLC unter den Unternehmen des Vereinigten Königreichs auch den zweifelhaften Ruf eines skrupellosen Unternehmens, wenn es um die Durchsetzung von Wirtschaftsinteressen ging. Diese Unternehmenspolitik wurde maßgeblich Tiny Rowland zugeschrieben. „Wie kein Zweiter beherrschte Rowland die Kunst der Täuschung und der Intrige. Er verstand es, aus dem kleinen ‚Kolonialgemischtwarenhandel‘ Lonrho eines der schlagkräftigsten Bergbau- und Handelsunternehmen des Britischen Empires zu machen. Er war ohne Frage in der Lage, einem afrikanischen Stammeshäuptling wertvolle Bergbaurechte für ein paar Glasperlen abzuschwatzen und ihn dabei im Glauben zu lassen, ein gutes Geschäft gemacht zu haben. Ich distanziere mich allerdings davon, Rowland als Gauner zu bezeichnen, da ich eine gewisse Sympathie und ein Maß an Respekt für die Leistung dieses Mannes nicht verhehlen kann (der Begriff Schlitzohr wäre angebrachter).“ Dieser schlechte Ruf verwehrte ihm auch die Anerkennung des britischen Establishments, die er stets angestrebt hatte. Ihm wurde stets mehr oder minder deutlich gemacht, dass er „keiner von ihnen“, sondern „nur“ ein Außenseiter war. Als eine seiner ersten Handlungen in seiner neuen Position als Geschäftsführer der Lonrho hatte Rowland die Rechte für eine Öl-Pipeline nach Beira in der damaligen portugiesischen Kolonie Mozambique gekauft. Die Kontrolle dieser Pipeline galt für Rhodesien, das über keinen eigenen Zugang zum Meer verfügte, als von unschätzbarem Wert; als Ian Smith 1965 aber die Unabhängigkeit Rhodesiens erklärte, zwangen Britische Wirtschaftssanktionen Rowland, die Pipeline zu schließen – was dieser auch augenscheinlich tat. Als Anfang der 1970er Jahre eine Gruppe von Lonrho-Direktoren (unter ihnen sein bisheriger Freund Sir Angus Ogilvy) Rowland zu verdrängen suchten, wurde von dieser Fraktion unter anderem die Frage aufgeworfen, ob Rowland sich seinerzeit wirklich an die britischen Vorgaben und Sanktionen gehalten habe. Dies löste in Großbritannien eine Untersuchung von hohem öffentlichen Interesse aus, die Rowland seinerseits mit dem Klageweg beantwortete. 1973 legte die britische Regierung einen 600-seitigen Untersuchungsbericht vor, der die Gesellschaft und Rowland hinsichtlich der geforderten Sanktionsmaßnahmen grundsätzlich freisprach, den seinerzeitigen britischen Premierminister Edward Heath aber zu der an die Adresse der Gesellschaft gerichteten legendären Bemerkung veranlasste, sie sei “the unacceptable face of capitalism” („das inakzeptable Gesicht des Kapitalismus“), eine Beschreibung, mit der in der Folge stets Rowland selbst etikettiert wurde, was dieser auch annahm, beantwortete er den Vorwurf doch damit, ein akzeptables Gesicht des Kapitalismus wolle er erst recht nicht sein. 1976 konnte Rowland auch kontern, dass Großbritannien selbst durch sein Miteigentum an BP die Sanktionen gegenüber Rhodesien verletzt hatte. Dies führte zu weiteren gegenseitigen Anschuldigungen, Rowland jedoch saß auf seinem Posten bei Lonrho nun fester als zuvor. The Observer 1983 kaufte Rowland im Namen der Lonrho eine der größten Sonntagszeitungen Großbritanniens, den Observer, den er sofort als Sprachrohr für sich und seine Aktivitäten bei Lonrho benutzte. Er war immer davon überzeugt gewesen, dass Zeitungen von enormer Wichtigkeit seien – sei es auch nur, um Politikern damit zu imponieren. Er besaß bereits selbst eine Reihe südafrikanischer Zeitungen. 1981 wurde er auf den Observer aufmerksam, der sechs Jahre zuvor von David Astor an die Atlantic Richfield Company des amerikanischen Öl-Tycoons Robert Anderson verkauft worden war. Der Kauf des Observer wurde durch 23 Provinzzeitungen des Vereinigten Königreiches ergänzt, die die Macht und den Einfluss der Lonrho weiter erhöhten. Rowland war trotz seiner Bemühungen ein Außenseiter im britischen Establishment geblieben, obwohl er stets deren Respekt erringen wollte. Durch den Kauf der verbreiteten Zeitung war es ihm möglich, Einfluss auf die Gesellschaft auszuüben. Bald galt in der Tat der Observer als Rowlands direktes Sprachrohr, mit dem er seine eigenen Interessen und die von Lonrho nach Belieben vertreten und vertreiben konnte. Insbesondere in der Affäre um den Kauf des Kaufhauses Harrods wurde dem Blatt tendenziöse Berichterstattung vorgeworfen. Harrods Ähnlich unbeirrt wie den Kauf einflussreicher Zeitungen betrieb Rowland in Großbritannien den Kauf von House of Fraser PLC, einer Unternehmensgruppe, die rund 60 Einzelhandelsgeschäfte auf der Insel betreibt und deren damaliges Flaggschiff das legendäre Kaufhaus Harrods in Knightsbridge, London – seinerzeit noch offizieller Hoflieferant der britischen Königsfamilie – darstellte. Seine Kaufversuche waren in der Vergangenheit von der britischen Regierung mehrfach unter der Vorgabe technischer Gründe abgewehrt worden. Mitte der 1980er Jahre, als er 29,9 Prozent der Anteile des Unternehmens hielt, wollte er einen neuen Versuch unternehmen. Da er zu Recht befürchten musste, dass eine erneute Konfrontation mit der britischen Regierung den Wert seines Aktienpaketes reduzieren würde, verkaufte er es an einen ägyptischen Geschäftsmann namens Mohamed Al-Fayed, von dem er überzeugt war, dass ihm nicht nur das Interesse, sondern auch die finanziellen Möglichkeiten fehlten, selbst den Kauf des Unternehmens ins Auge zu fassen und, selbst wenn, er sicherlich noch mehr Schwierigkeiten als er mit einer Genehmigung des Geschäftes durch die britische Regierung haben würde. Rowland täuschte sich in diesen Annahmen. Im März 1985 genehmigte die britische Regierung in einer ungewöhnlich schnellen Entscheidung die Übernahme von House of Fraser durch Al-Fayed, der seinerseits ebenso schnell die erforderlichen 900 Millionen US-Dollar von Hassan al-Bolkiah, dem Sultan von Brunei, erhielt. Eigenen Verschwörungen und Intrigen nie abgeneigt, war Rowland tief getroffen, nun selbst einer solchen zum Opfer gefallen zu sein und dabei sogar noch tatkräftig mitgeholfen zu haben, indem er Al-Fayed sein eigenes Aktienpaket überlassen hatte. Rowland versuchte mit allen Mitteln, den Deal zu sabotieren, und begann eine Fehde mit Al-Fayed, die bis an sein Lebensende dauern und ihn geschätzte 20 Millionen britische Pfund kosten sollte. Fehde mit Al-Fayed Rowland setzte in diesem Streit all seine Kraft und Beziehungen ein. Er benutzte Kontakte zu führenden politischen Kreisen, um das Wirtschaftsministerium zu einer Untersuchung der Einzelheiten von Al-Fayeds Übernahme zu zwingen. Obwohl der entsprechende Bericht niemals veröffentlicht wurde, gelang es Rowland, in den Besitz einer Kopie zu gelangen. Er brachte an einem Donnerstag eine Sonderausgabe der Sonntagszeitung The Observer mit den Einzelheiten heraus: Die Untersuchungskommission war 1990 zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass die Fayed-Brüder hinsichtlich ihrer Herkunft und ihrer Vermögensverhältnisse gelogen und ihre Vermögensverhältnisse verschleiert hätten. An den Besitzverhältnissen änderte sich gleichwohl nichts. Rowland erhob weitere schwere Vorwürfe. Nun warf er Al-Fayed beziehungsweise seinen Angestellten vor, ein Depotfach bei Harrods aufgebrochen und Juwelen daraus gestohlen zu haben. Al-Fayed wurde am 2. März 1998 verhaftet, zu den Anschuldigungen verhört und danach unter Auflagen wieder auf freien Fuß gesetzt. 1993 schien eine öffentliche Begegnung zwischen den Rivalen das Ende der Auseinandersetzung anzukündigen; kurz darauf brachen jedoch neue Konflikte auf. Wirklich beendet wurde der Streit erst nach Rowlands Tod. Mit der Begründung, der Diebstahl sei in seiner Zeit als Harrods-Vorsitzender passiert, zahlte Al-Fayed der Witwe 1,4 Millionen englische Pfund – ohne Schuldeingeständnis. Der Zwist zwischen Rowland und Al-Fayed berührte auch die Lonrho, mittlerweile auf ein sechs-Milliarden-Unternehmen mit mehr als 125.000 Mitarbeitern rund um den Globus angewachsen. Die Stellung des Unternehmens als weltgrößter PKW-Vertriebshändler für Rolls-Royce, VW, Audi, Mercedes und französische, japanische und amerikanische Wagen in Großbritannien, Europa und Afrika, drittgrößter Platin-Produzent, wichtiger Goldproduzent, Afrikas führender Lebensmittelproduzent und Eigentümer von 1,5 Millionen Quadratkilometer Land und 125.000 Rindern war in direkter Gefahr. Gleichzeitig erlebte das Konglomerat – in seiner Funktion als Minengesellschaft – einen massiven Preisverfall von Edelmetallen. Innerhalb eines einzigen Jahres – 1990/91 – fiel der Preis für Rhodium um die Hälfte, von 4.200 US-Dollar auf 2.100 US-Dollar pro Unze. Da die Gewinne des Konglomerats trotz der Vielzahl seiner anderen Betriebe zu immerhin 36 Prozent aus dem Minengeschäft stammten, erlebte sie hierdurch hohe Verluste – verbunden mit einem zunehmend mangelnden Vertrauen der Anleger aufgrund der endlosen Fehde der beiden Widersacher. So fielen die Einnahmen der Gesellschaft von 1990 auf 1992 von 273 Millionen Englischen Pfund auf nur 79 Millionen Englische Pfund und die Verbindlichkeiten näherten sich schnell der Milliardengrenze. Weiterhin sorgte im Dezember 1991 ein Gerücht, Tiny Rowland sei bei einem Flugzeugunfall tödlich verunglückt, für einen Kursverfall der Lonrho-Aktien von 2,20 auf 1,60 britische Pfund innerhalb von drei Tagen, wovon sich das Unternehmen nicht mehr erholen konnte. Zunächst versuchte sich Rowland in einer Allianz mit dem australischen Unternehmer Alan Bond. Als Bond es aber wagte, eine Übernahme auch nur anzudeuten, wendete Rowland sich gegen ihn. Bond verlor 60 Millionen und musste Konkurs anmelden. Sodann ging Rowland eine überaus umstrittene und letztlich wenig erfolgreiche Allianz mit Muammar al-Gaddafi, dem Staatschef Libyens, ein, dem er Hotelanteile verkaufte. Dieter Bock An diesem Punkt kam Dieter Bock ins Spiel, gelernter Jurist und Steuerberater, der sich auf Immobiliengeschäfte aller Art verlegt hatte, bis dato aber nur mäßig bekannt und ohne internationale Erfahrung war und der, wie er später sagte, Lonrho „ganz zufällig“ entdeckte, während er unter führenden Unternehmen der 1980er Jahre recherchierte. Ende 1992 wurde überraschend verkündet, dass Bock ab Januar 1993 Lonrhos größtes Aktienpaket halten und sich den Vorstandsvorsitz mit Rowland teilen würde. Während sich Rowland weiter unbeirrt seinem Feldzug gegen Al-Fayed widmete, wurde Bock schnell aktiv. Er bezeichnete diese Fehde Rowlands als einen überaus schädlichen Angriff auf die Finanzen des Unternehmens und forderte gleichzeitig eine Verjüngung des Vorstands, in dem mehrere Mitglieder deutlich jenseits des Pensionsalters waren und neben ihren beachtlichen Gehältern ähnlich beachtliche Pensionen bezogen. Bock scheute sich auch nicht, Rowlands Bezüge und seine Geschäftsausgaben zu kritisieren. Auch thematisierte er offen, Rowland möge seine Vorstandstätigkeit aufgeben, was er schließlich im November 1994 erreichte. Sodann verkaufte er 1997 nach Art einer frühen Heuschrecke seinen Firmenanteil mit einem riesigen Gewinn nach Südafrika und verließ Lonrho noch zu Rowlands Lebzeiten. „Ich werde ihn verfolgen bis ans Ende seiner Tage“, soll Rowland sich geschworen haben. Den von der FAZ (8. Januar 1999) als „bescheiden gekleideter, überaus unauffälliger, zurückhaltender Mann“ beschriebenen Dieter Bock taxierte das manager magazin 1997 in der Liste der reichsten Deutschen auf 650 Millionen Euro. Er starb am Himmelfahrtstag 2010 an einem falsch geschluckten Essensbissen im Hotel Atlantic in Hamburg. |
G;|Rasmus Schüller (* 18. Juni 1991 in Espoo, Finnland) ist ein finnischer Fußballspieler auf der Position eines Mittelfeldspielers. Seit 2016 steht er im Aufgebot des schwedischen Erstligisten BK Häcken.  Karrierebeginn und erste Schritte beim FC Honka Im Jahre 1991 wurde Schüller in Finnlands zweitgrößter Stadt Espoo geboren, wo er auch aufwuchs und seine Karriere als Fußballspieler beim unterklassigen FC Kasiysi begann. Von dort wechselte er noch im Nachwuchsalter zu HooGee, von wo aus er zu seiner nächsten Station, dem FC Honka, wechselte. Beim höchstklassig spielenden Fußballverein Espoos spielte er bis 2008 im vereinseigenen Nachwuchs und kam im Spieljahr 2008 zum ersten Mal in der Profimannschaft mit Spielbetrieb in der Veikkausliiga zum Einsatz. Dabei wurde Schüller, der zuvor bereits in einigen Partien seiner Mannschaft ohne Einsatz auf der Ersatzbank saß, schließlich in drei Ligapartien im August 2008 eingesetzt. Sein Debüt gab er dabei am 10. August 2008 beim 2:0-Auswärtssieg über RoPS, als er für Jussi Vasara, den Torschützen zum 2:0, in der 82. Minute aufs Spielfeld kam. Des Weiteren wurde der Mittelfeldakteur Ende Oktober 2008 im Viertel- und im Halbfinale des finnischen Fußballpokals 2008 eingesetzt. Nachdem die Mannschaft erst in der sechsten Rundes des Cups dazugestoßen war, schaffte es die Mannschaft bis ins Finale, wo man dem HJK Helsinki allerdings knapp mit 1:2 nach der Verlängerung unterlegen war. Im Finalspiel wurde Rasmus Schüller allerdings nicht von Mika Lehkosuo eingesetzt. In der Meisterschaft belegte er mit der Mannschaft am Jahresende den zweiten Platz hinter Inter Turku und nahm mit der Mannschaft an der 2. Qualifikationsrunde zur Europa League 2009/10 teil. Im Vorjahr hatte Schüller bereits einen Auftritt in der Qualifikation zum UEFA-Pokal 2008/09, in dem der FC Honka in der 1. Runde gegen Racing Santander ausschied. Des Weiteren wurde er 2008 in einer unbekannten Anzahl an Ligaspielen der B-Mannschaft eingesetzt, wobei er zwei Tore erzielte. In diesem Jahr fuhr die Mannschaft mit einem 7:0-Kantersieg über Haka Valkeakoski auch das höchste Ergebnis dieses Spieljahres in der Veikkausliiga ein. Das Spieljahr 2009 verbrachte er zum Großteil bereits als Stammspieler des FC Honka, wobei er über die gesamte Spielzeit in 19 Partien eingesetzt wurde, in denen er zwei Tore erzielte und weitere drei für seine Mannschaftskameraden vorbereitete. Sein erster Pflichtspieltreffer als Profi gelang ihm dabei am 24. Juni 2009 beim 4:1-Heimerfolg über den Kuopion PS, als er nach Vorarbeit von Hermanni Vuorinen in der 42. Minute zur 2:0-Führung seines Teams traf. Mit der Mannschaft trat er auch an der besagten 2. Qualifikationsrunde zur Europa League an und erzielte dabei gleich 2:0 im Hinspiel gegen Bangor City sein erstes Tor für den FC Honka auf internationaler Ebene. In der 3. Qualirunde schied die Mannschaft schließlich gegen den aserbaidschanischen Verein FK Qarabağ Ağdam mit einem Gesamtscore von 1:3 vom laufenden Wettbewerb aus. Im finnischen Pokal des Jahres 2009 schied Schüller mit der Mannschaft nach dem Elfmeterschießen im Halbfinale gegen Tampere United aus; im finnischen Ligapokal 2009 folgte das vorläufige Ausscheiden, ebenfalls nach einem Elfmeterschießen, bereits im Viertelfinale gegen TPS. Zu weiteren Einsätzen kam Rasmus Schüller in diesem Jahr in zwei Ligapartien für den neugegründeten Klub Pallohonka, der neuen B-Mannschaft des FC Honka, in der drittklassigen Kakkonen. Die Mannschaft erreichte im Endklassement einen Platz im Tabellenmittelfeld. Bis zum Saisonende rangierte das Profiteam mit drei Punkten Rückstand auf HJK Helsinki auf dem zweiten Tabellenplatz und qualifizierte sich somit erneut für die Teilnahme an der 2. Qualifikationsrunde an der nächstjährigen EL-Austragung. Des Weiteren ging die Mannschaft im Februar 2009 im spanischen La Manga als Sieger des dort alljährlich ausgespielten La Manga Cups vom Platz. Mit einem 9:0-Kantersieg über RoPS konnte die Mannschaft auch den höchsten Sieg dieses Spieljahres in der Veikkausliiga einfahren. In der Saison 2010 kam Schüller erneut in 19 Ligaspielen zum Einsatz, wobei er drei Mal zum Torerfolg kam, sowie vier Vorlage beisteuerte. Bei der 2. Qualifikationsrunde zur Europa League 2009/10 traf Schüller mit seiner Mannschaft abermals auf Bangor City, wobei er sich mit der Mannschaft allerdings in Hin- und Rückspiel nicht gegen die Waliser durchsetzen konnte und mit einem Gesamtergebnis von 2:3 aus dem laufenden Turnier ausschied. Während die Gelb-Schwarzen aus Espoo bereits in der sechsten Runde des finnischen Pokals 2010 mit 0:3 gegen HJK Helsinki ausgeschieden war, schaffte die Mannschaft im Ligapokal 2010 den Einzug ins Finale. Nachdem die Mannschaft bereits im Viertelfinale fast am AC Oulu gescheitert war und nur knapp mit 8:7 im Elfmeterschießen weiterkam, konnte sich das Team nach einem 2:0-Semifinalsieg über Inter Turku ebenfalls im Elfmeterschießen im anschließenden Final mit 4:3 gegen den JJK Jyväskylä durchsetzen. Wie bereits im Jahr zuvor wurde Schüller auch in diesem Jahr in zwei Ligapartien von Pallohonka eingesetzt und kam dabei sogar in einer Begegnung zum Torerfolg. Die Mannschaft erreichte im Endklassement den fünften Platz in der Gruppe B der drittklassigen Kakkonen. In der Endtabelle reichte es in diesem Jahr für die Profimannschaft lediglich für einen vierten Rang; der Sieg im Ligapokal reichte allerdings noch für die Teilnahme an der 1. Qualifikationsrunde zur Europa League 2011/12. Am Spieljahr 2011 war Schüller erneut an einem Großteil der ausgetragenen Partien im Einsatz. Bis zum Saisonende, als die Mannschaft das Spieljahr auf dem vierten Platz beendete, konnte es der finnische Mittelfeldakteur auf insgesamt 22 Ligaeinsätze bringen, in denen er selbst zwar torlos blieb, allerdings drei Torvorlagen beisteuerte. Anfangs sollte das Spieljahr mit 14 Mannschaften ausgetragen werden, wurde aber nach der Lizenzverweigerung an Tampere United und den AC Oulu mit nur 12 Vereinen in 33 Spielen ausgetragen. Schüller stand dabei ab der 25. Runde nicht mehr im Aufgebot der Profimannschaft. Des Weiteren hatte der FC Honka mit 14 Ligaspielen in Folge auch die längste Serie ohne Niederlage in dieser Saison. Während der FC Honka im finnischen Pokalbewerb 2011 in Runde 7 abermals ein jähes Ende fand und dabei mit 0:1 gegen den IFK Mariehamn ausschied, erreichte die Mannschaft, wie bereits im Vorjahr, das Finale des finnischen Ligapokals 2011. Das Finale am 23. April 2011 konnte nach Toren von Nicholas Otaru und Demba Savage klar mit 3:0 gegen Tampere United gewonnen werden. In der 1. Qualirunde zur EL 2011/12 konnte die Mannschaft beim Hinspiel in Espoo nur ein mageres 0:0-Remis verzeichnen, setzte sich aber im anschließenden Rückspiel gegen den estnischen Klub Nõmme Kalju mit 2:0 durch und traf in der 2. Qualifikationsrunde auf einen schwedischen Vertreter, den BK Häcken. Dieses Aufeinandertreffen konnte beide Male der BK Häcken mit einem späteren Gesamtscore von 0:3 für sich entscheiden, der allerdings selbst bereits in der nächsten Runde ausschied. Wechsel zum finnischen Rekordmeister Anfang Februar 2012 wechselte Schüller für eine kolportierte Ablösesumme von etwa 200.000 Euro zum finnischen Rekordmeister HJK Helsinki, wo er unter Antti Muurinen sein Mannschaftsdebüt gab. Dabei spielte er nur zehn Tage nach seinem offiziellen Wechsel ausgerechnet im Ligapokal des Jahres 2012 gegen seinen Ex-Klub aus Espoo, wobei er bei der klaren 0:4-Niederlage über die volle Spieldauer im Einsatz war. Beim HJK Helsinki wurde Schüller beinahe über das gesamte Spieljahr als Stammkraft im Mittelfeld eingesetzt und konnte vor allem ab der 26. Runde seine Offensivstärke unter Beweis stellen, wobei er hierbei zwei Tore erzielte und weitere vier für seine Mannschaftskameraden vorbereitete. Davor war ihm in den anderen Runden nur eine Torvorlage gelungen; insgesamt absolvierte er 2012 25 Meisterschaftsspiele für den Hauptstadtverein. Das die Mannschaft als Meister des Vorjahres ab der 2. Qualifikationsrunde zur Champions League 2012/13 teilnahm, wurde auch Schüller in ebendieser eingesetzt. Dabei erzielte er beim 7:0-Kantersieg im Hinspiel gegen KR Reykjavík auch einen Treffer und wurde auch beim späteren 2:1-Sieg im Rückspiel eingesetzt. In der 3. Qualifikationsrunde schied die Mannschaft, die sich hierfür über den Champions-Weg qualifizierte, gegen Celtic Glasgow mit einem Gesamtergebnis von 1:4 vom laufenden Turnier aus und stieg daraufhin in der Play-off-Phase der Europa League 2012/13 wieder ein. Bei der 1:2-Auswärtsniederlage in Glasgow erzielte Schüller per Abstauber das einzige Tor seiner Mannschaft. Auch hierbei konnte sich die Mannschaft nicht lange im Turnier halten und schied noch am Ende der Play-offs mit einem Gesamtscore von 3:9 gegen Athletic Bilbao aus. Beim Auswärtsspiel in Spanien noch mit einer 0:6-Niederlage konfrontiert, gelang beim Rückspiel in der Heimat zwar ein 3:3-Remis, bei dem Rasmus Schüller neben einem Treffer auch eine Torvorlage beisteuerte, das allerdings nicht für ein Weiterkommen reichte. Während der amtierende Meister im finnischen Pokal 2012 bereits im Semifinale ausgerechnet gegen Schüllers ehemaligen Klub mit einem Ergebnis von 4:5 nach dem Elfmeterschießen ausschied, schaffte es die Mannschaft mit Schüllers Beteiligung bis ins Finale des finnischen Ligapokals 2012. Dort unterlag die Mannschaft, ebenfalls im Elferschießen, dem Turku PS vor etwas mehr als 2.000 Zuschauern im Sonera Stadium. In der Liga lief es für die Spieler von Antti Muurinen besser, wobei mit sechs Punkten Vorsprung auf den nächsten Verfolger Inter Turku der erste Platz erreicht werden konnte. Damit qualifizierte sich der Club automatisch für die 2. Qualirunde zur CL 2013/14, wo die Mannschaft allerdings mit einem Gesamtergebnis von 1:2 gegen Nõmme Kalju bereits vorzeitig ausschied. Im Spieljahr 2013 wurde Rasmus Schüller unter dem neuen Trainer Sixten Boström erneut in einem Großteil der insgesamt 33 ausgetragenen Ligaspiele eingesetzt, wobei er es auf insgesamt 23 Ligaauftritte brachte, jedoch wesentlich offensiver agierte als noch in den Jahren zuvor. So gelangen ihm insgesamt sieben Tore, wobei er hinter Mikael Forssell (14 Tore), Demba Savage und Erfan Zeneli (je 11 Tore) nur viertbester Torschütze des HJK Helsinki war, sowie vier Torvorlagen. Aufgrund seiner Leistungen wurde er in diesem Jahr auch zum ersten Mal in die Nationalmannschaft seines Heimatlandes einberufen und auch erstmals in dieser eingesetzt. Im finnischen Fußballpokal 2013 folgte für Schüller, der bei zwei Pokaleinsätzen auf einen Treffer kam, und seine Mannschaft ein jähes Aus nach einer 0:1-Niederlage gegen RoPS in der sechsten Runde. Auch im finnischen Ligapokal 2013 schied die Mannschaft bereits im Viertelfinale nach einer Niederlage im Elferschießen gegen JJK Jyväskylä vorzeitig vom laufenden Turnier aus; Schüller war dabei in sechs Partien im Einsatz, in denen er torlos blieb. Im Ligageschehen lief es erneut besser für den vielseitig einsetzbaren Mittelfeldakteur und seine Mannschaft; so rangierte HJK Helsinki in der Endtabelle mit 73 Punkten und zwölf Zählern Vorsprung auf den Zweitplatzierten FC Honka Espoo und sicherte sich somit zum fünften Mal in Folge den finnischen Meistertitel. In diesem Spieljahr konnte der Hauptstadtklub mit einem 6:0-Erfolg über Inter Turku am 13. Juni nicht nur den höchsten Heimsieg der Saison einfahren, sondern erzielte mit einem 5:0-Sieg über den IFK Mariehamn am 27. Juni auch den höchsten Auswärtssieg des Jahres. Durch den Meistertitel 2013 nahm der Klub erneut an der 2. Qualifikationsrunde zur Champions League 2014/15 teil, wo die Mannschaft auf Rabotnički Skopje traf und sich gegen die Mazedonier mit einem Gesamtergebnis von 2:1 knapp durchsetzten konnte. In der 3. Qualifikationsrunde scheiterte das Team um Rasmus Schüller, der im Turnier abwechselnd als rechter und zentraler Mittelfeldspieler eingesetzt wurde, mit einem Gesamtscore von 2:4 an APOEL Nikosia. Aufgrund des Ausscheidens in der 3. Qualifikationsrunde zur Champions League stieg HJK in die Play-off-Phase der Europa League 2014/15 ein, wo sich die Mannschaft knapp mit einem Gesamtergebnis von 5:4 gegen den SK Rapid Wien durchsetzte und sich somit für die anschließende Gruppenphase qualifizierte. Dort traf der finnische Klub zwischen September und Dezember 2014 auf den FC Kopenhagen, den FC Brügge, sowie den FC Turin, wobei die Mannschaft als Dritter der Gruppe B vom laufenden Turnier ausschied. Dabei kam Schüller, unter anderem verletzungsbedingt, kaum zum Einsatz und kam erst in den letzten beiden Partien zum Zug. In der Spieljahr 2014 kam Schüller, zum Teil ebenfalls wegen seiner mehrmonatigen Verletzungspause, in lediglich elf Ligapartien zum Einsatz, wobei er auf eine Bilanz von einem Treffer und drei Assists kam. Kurz nach dem Meisterschaftsstart kam es beim Hauptstadtklub bereits zu einem Trainerwechsel, wobei der bisherige Trainer Sixten Boström durch Schüllers langjährigem Trainer Mika Lehkosuo ersetzt wurde und dieser neben Schüller auf zahlreiche seiner ehemaligen und bereits zu HJK abgewanderten Schützlinge stieß. Die Meisterschaft beendete das Team rund um Mittelfeldakteur Schüller miz zehn Punkten Vorsprung auf den Neuaufsteiger Seinäjoen JK auf dem ersten Tabellenplatz. Doch der 2014 oftmals im defensiven Mittelfeld eingesetzte Spieler kam auch zu Einsätzen im Ligapokal 2014, wo der Hauptstadtverein erst im Semifinale mit 0:1 gegen den späteren Ligapokalsieger Seinäjoen JK ausschied. Des Weiteren wurde er im finnischen Pokal 2014 eingesetzt, in dem die Mannschaft nach einem Halbfinalsieg über IFK Mariehamn bereits als Gegner des anderen Semifinalsiegers, Inter Turku, für das anfangs für den 27. September 2014 gesetzte Finalspiel feststand. Das Pokalfinale wurde schließlich am 1. November 2014 ausgetragen, wobei der Hauptstadtklub erst nach absolvierten Elfmeterschießen als finnischer Pokalsieger hervorging. Im Spieljahr 2015 fand Rasmus Schüller wieder zu alter Stärke zurück, wurde in 30 von 33 möglich gewesenen Ligapartien eingesetzt, in denen er zwar keinen Treffer, jedoch drei Torvorlagen für seine Mannschaftskollegen beisteuerte. In einem knappen Saisonende rangierte der HJK Helsinki mit 58 Punkten und damit einem Punkt Rückstand auf RoPS und zwei Zählern Rückstand auf den Vorjahresvizemeister Seinäjoen JK auf dem dritten Tabellenplatz im Endklassement. Im finnischen Pokal 2015 schied die Mannschaft erst im Halbfinale mit 1:5 gegen den späteren Pokalsieger IFK Mariehamn aus, konnte sich jedoch im finnischen Ligapokal 2015 im Finale mit 2:0 gegen RoPS durchsetzen. Im internationalen Vereinsfußball trat er in diesem Jahr in der Qualifikationsphase zur UEFA Champions League 2015/16 in Erscheinung, wobei er alle vier Spiele der zweiten und dritten Qualirunde absolvierte, ehe er mit seiner Mannschaft ausschied. Weiters kam er in beiden Parien der nachfolgenden Play-offs der Qualifikation zur UEFA Europa League 2015/16 zum Einsatz, schied dort allerdings mit einem Gesamtscore von 1:5 gegen den russischen Klub FK Krasnodar aus. Bereits am 7. Oktober 2015 wurde bekannt, dass der mehrfache finnische Internationale zum Spieljahr 2016 in die Fotbollsallsvenskan zum dort aktiven BK Häcken wechselt. Als mehrfacher Nationalspieler nach Schweden Nachdem er offiziell Anfang des Jahres 2016 zusammen mit seinem Teamkollegen Demba Savage nach Schweden gewechselt war, gab er dort am 26. Februar 2016 im schwedischen Pokal 2015/16 sein Pflichtspieldebüt, als er von Peter Gerhardsson als Kapitän über die vollen 90 Minuten beim 0:0-Remis gegen den IF Brommapojkarna eingesetzt wurde. Mit der Mannschaft startet er Anfang April 2016 in das Spieljahr 2016. |
G;|Franz Peter Schubert (* 31. Jänner 1797 in der Gemeinde Himmelpfortgrund, heute ein Stadtteil von Wien im Bezirk Alsergrund; † 19. November 1828 in Wieden, heute ein Stadtteil von Wien) war ein österreichischer Komponist. Obwohl er schon im Alter von 31 Jahren starb, hinterließ er ein reiches und vielfältiges Werk. Er komponierte rund 600 Lieder, weltliche und geistliche Chormusik, sieben vollständige und fünf unvollendete Sinfonien, Ouvertüren, Bühnenwerke, Klaviermusik und Kammermusik. Zu seinen Lebzeiten war die Zahl seiner Bewunderer noch begrenzt. Mendelssohn, Schumann, Liszt, Brahms und andere Komponisten der Romantik entdeckten und rühmten das Werk ihres Vorgängers. Heute ist Schuberts Rang als herausragender Vertreter der frühen Romantik unbestritten.    Kindheit Franz Peter Schubert wurde als dreizehntes von sechzehn Kindern geboren. Von diesen sechzehn Kindern wurden nur fünf älter als ein Jahr und vier erreichten das Erwachsenenalter. Schuberts Vater Franz Theodor (* 1763 in Neudorf in Nordmähren, heute Vysoká) war Lehrer und Schulleiter. Seine Mutter Elisabeth Vietz (* 1756 in Zuckmantel, Österreichisch Schlesien, heute Zlaté Hory; † 28. Mai 1812) war vor der Hochzeit Köchin in einer Wiener Familie. Im Alter von fünf Jahren erhielt Schubert den ersten regelmäßigen musikalischen Unterricht: Sein Vater lehrte ihn, Violine zu spielen. Mit sechs Jahren ging er in der Wiener Vorstadt Lichtental in die Schule. Mit sieben Jahren bekam er von Michael Holzer, dem Kapellmeister der Lichtentaler Pfarrkirche, bereits Orgelunterricht. Wegen seiner schönen Stimme wurde er im Oktober 1808 als Sängerknabe in die Wiener Hofmusikkapelle und in das kaiserliche Konvikt aufgenommen. Schubert lernte dort viele seiner späteren langjährigen Freunde kennen – wie Joseph von Spaun, Albert Stadler und Anton Holzapfel. Er genoss im Konvikt neben dem Kompositionsunterricht von Wenzel Ruzicka und später Antonio Salieri vielfältige musikalische Anregung. Er wirkte nicht bloß als Solist im Gesang, sondern lernte auch die Instrumentalwerke Joseph Haydns und Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts kennen, da er zweiter Violinist im Konviktorchester war. Bald zeigte sich seine Begabung in der Komposition. Eine Klavierfantasie G-Dur zu vier Händen ist datiert 8. April – 1. Mai 1810. Im nächsten Jahr folgten ein Streichquartett, eine weitere Fantasie in g-Moll, Lieder und andere Stücke. An Sonn- und Feiertagen wurden in der Familie regelmäßig Streichquartettabende veranstaltet, bei denen sein Vater Violoncello, er selbst Viola und seine Brüder Violine spielten. Jugend Waren seine schulischen Leistungen anfangs noch gut, so verschlechterte er sich im Laufe der Zeit besonders in Mathematik und Latein. Er schlug die Möglichkeit aus, seinen Stiftungsplatz zu verlängern, und kehrte im Oktober 1813 in das elterliche Haus zurück. Zu dieser Zeit komponierte er seine Sinfonie Nr. 1 D-Dur. Nachdem er eine Lehrerbildungsanstalt besucht hatte, wurde er Ende 1814 Schulgehilfe seines Vaters, ein Amt, das er zwei Jahre hindurch und Ende 1817 / Anfang 1818 noch einmal für kurze Zeit versah. Daneben erhielt er noch bis 1816 Unterricht bei Antonio Salieri und komponierte produktiv: Seine erste Oper Des Teufels Lustschloß und seine Messe Nr. 1 F-Dur (die Uraufführung am 25. September 1814 in der Lichtentaler Pfarrkirche war die erste öffentliche Aufführung eines seiner Werke) stammen beide aus dem Jahr 1814, ebenso mehrere Streichquartette, kürzere Instrumentalwerke, der erste Satz seiner Sinfonie Nr. 2 B-Dur und mehr als zwanzig Lieder, darunter Meisterwerke wie Gretchen am Spinnrade (aus Goethes Faust) und interessante Experimente wie die Ballade Der Taucher (nach Schiller). Eine noch größere Zahl an Werken komponierte er 1815. Trotz seiner Arbeit als Lehrer beendete er zwei Sinfonien (Nr. 2 B-Dur, Nr. 3 D-Dur), zwei Messen (Nr. 2 G-Dur, Nr. 3 B-Dur), die Opern Der vierjährige Posten, Fernando und Claudine von Villa Bella sowie zwei weitere unvollendete. Dazu kamen das Streichquartett g-Moll, vier Sonaten und einige weitere Kompositionen für Klavier sowie fast 150 Lieder von teilweise beträchtlicher Länge, von denen er manchmal mehrere pro Tag schrieb. Angesichts der zunehmenden Unvereinbarkeit seiner Lehrerstelle mit dem Komponieren unternahm Schubert zahlreiche Versuche, sich als Komponist zu etablieren. Aber die Verlage lehnten die Publikation seiner Werke ab. Im Frühjahr 1816 bewarb er sich erfolglos um den Posten eines Kapellmeisters in Laibach / Ljubljana. Über seinen Freund Joseph von Spaun kam er in Wien in Kontakt mit Franz von Schober. Auf dessen Vorschlag verließ Schubert seine Lehrerstelle und zog für acht Monate in Schobers Wohnung, um mehr Zeit mit der Komposition zu verbringen. Von den Kompositionen aus diesem Jahr seien nur die Goethe-Ballade Erlkönig, die Prometheus-Kantate, die beiden Sinfonien Nr. 4 c-Moll (die „Tragische“) und Nr. 5 B-Dur sowie die Messe Nr. 4 C-Dur erwähnt. Während dieser ganzen Zeit weitete sich sein Freundeskreis ständig aus. Der Dichter Johann Mayrhofer, den er im Dezember 1814 kennengelernt hatte, schrieb ihm zwei Libretti. Schober machte ihn mit dem Bariton Johann Michael Vogl bekannt, einem der wichtigsten Sänger an der Wiener Hofoper, der seine Lieder bald in den literarischen Salons sang und ihn damit der Öffentlichkeit vorstellte. Der Pianist Josef von Gahy spielte seine Sonaten und Fantasien. Die musikalische Bürgerfamilie Sonnleithner, insbesondere deren ältester Sohn, Leopold von Sonnleithner, organisierten zu seinen Ehren musikalische Zusammenkünfte, die ab 1821 als Schubertiaden bezeichnet wurden (und in ähnlicher, aber auch völlig anders organisierter Form noch immer stattfinden). Schubert hatte kein eigentliches Einkommen, denn seine Lehrerstelle hatte er aufgegeben, öffentliche Auftritte brachten nichts ein, die Verleger interessierten sich noch nicht für seine Musik. Für sein Auskommen mussten teils seine Freunde sorgen. In einer sogenannten Unsinnsgesellschaft junger Künstler pflegte er enge Kontakte zu den Brüdern Kupelwieser, seinem späteren Librettisten Joseph Kupelwieser und dem Maler Leopold Kupelwieser, der als einer von wenigen authentische zeitgenössische Porträts von Schubert gemalt hat – neben Wilhelm August Rieder (Aquarell 1825) und Anton Depauly (dessen Porträt von 1828 ursprünglich und irrtümlich Joseph Willibrord Mähler oder Franz Eybl zugeschrieben wurde). Als Schubert 1817 zum ersten Mal vom Lehrerdienst befreit war, widmete er sich insbesondere der Klaviersonate (a-Moll D 537, As-Dur D 557, e-Moll D 566, Des-Dur D 567, fis-Moll D 570, H-Dur D 575). Auch die Entstehung einiger seiner bekanntesten Lieder fiel in diese Zeit (etwa Ganymed, Der Tod und das Mädchen und Die Forelle). Im Jänner 1818 erschien mit dem Lied Erlafsee (D 586) Schuberts erste Komposition im Druck (als Beilage zur von Franz Sartori herausgegebenen Anthologie „Mahlerisches Taschenbuch für Freunde interessanter Gegenden. Natur- und Kunst-Merkwürdigkeiten der Österreichischen Monarchie“). Von Anfang Juli bis Mitte November 1818 (und auch im Sommer 1824) war er von der Familie des Grafen Johann Carl Esterházy, die er schon in dessen Stadtpalais in Wien musikalisch betreut hatte, als Sing- und Klaviermeister auf deren Gut in Zselíz / Zelis in Ungarn (heute Slowakei) engagiert. Für die Komtessen Marie und Caroline, die Töchter des Grafen, schrieb er vierhändige Stücke und Lieder. Im selben Jahr schuf er seine Sinfonie Nr. 6 in C-Dur. Bei seiner Rückkehr nach Wien im Spätherbst 1818 kam Schubert nicht mehr bei Schober unter und wohnte nun zwei Jahre mit Johann Mayrhofer. Sein Leben ging nun wieder den alten Gang: Jeden Morgen begann er nach dem Aufstehen mit dem Komponieren, aß um zwei Uhr, ging spazieren und wandte sich dann erneut der Komposition zu oder besuchte Freunde. Seine Entscheidung gegen den Lehrerberuf war nun endgültig. Seinen ersten Auftritt als Liedkomponist hatte er am 28. Februar 1819 im Saal des Hotels „Zum römischen Kaiser“ (Freyung Nr. 145, heute Renngasse 1) mit Schäfers Klagelied. Im Sommer des gleichen Jahres ging er mit Vogl auf Urlaub in Oberösterreich. Im Herbst schickte er drei seiner Lieder an Goethe, aber – soweit bekannt – ohne Erfolg. Reifejahre In den folgenden Jahren ging Schuberts Schaffen quantitativ zurück, dafür zeigen die Kompositionen des Jahres 1820 eine Weiterentwicklung seines Stils. Im Februar begann er mit dem unvollendet gebliebenen Oratorium Lazarus, später schrieb er neben kleineren Stücken eine Vertonung des 23. Psalms für Chor mit Klavierbegleitung, den Gesang der Geister und den Quartettsatz in c-Moll. Erstmals wurden in diesem Jahr zwei von Schuberts Opern aufgeführt: das einaktige Singspiel Die Zwillingsbrüder am 14. Juni am Theater am Kärntnertor und Die Zauberharfe am 19. August im Theater an der Wien. Bis dahin waren seine größeren Kompositionen – mit Ausnahme der Messen – nicht über das Amateurorchester im Gundelhof hinausgekommen, das aus den heimischen Quartettveranstaltungen hervorgegangen war. Da beide Stücke passable Erfolge waren, konnte er sich nun an eine breitere Öffentlichkeit wenden. Aber erst als Vogl den Erlkönig in einem öffentlichen Konzert gesungen hatte, konnte der Verleger Anton Diabelli überzeugt werden, einige Werke Schuberts auf Kommission zu veröffentlichen. 1821 begann die Freundschaft mit Moritz von Schwind. Schubert wohnte zeitweise wieder bei seinem Freund Franz von Schober, etwa 1822 im Göttweiger Hof, wo unter anderem die Unvollendete und die Wanderer-Fantasie entstanden. Es fanden Schubertiaden im Freundeskreis statt, unter anderem im niederösterreichischen Schloss Atzenbrugg, wo Schobers Onkel Gutsverwalter war. Etliche Gedichtvertonungen, so Jägers Liebeslied, beziehen sich auf die Freundschaft mit Schober. Ähnlich wie bei Schuberts Beziehung zu Mayrhofer wurde daher später Homosexualität Schuberts konstatiert. Thomas Phleps wehrte sich dagegen, weil eine solche Kategorisierung der Freundschaftsbeziehungen, ähnlich wie die Einordnung Schuberts in ein „weinselig-weibernärrisches Schwammerlklischee“, als unnatürliche, nachträgliche Konstruktion wirke. 1821/22 verdiente Schubert an der Veröffentlichung von Opus 1–7 und 10–12 etwa 800 fl. Konventionsmünze. Als Schulgehilfe hatte er von seinem Vater neben Kost und Logis jährlich lediglich 80 fl. bekommen. Otto Erich Deutsch schätzte Schuberts weiteres Einkommen aus Veröffentlichungen, Honoraren und Geschenken zwischen 1822 und 1828 auf etwa 7000 fl. Konventionsmünze. Ermutigt von den Erfolgen versuchte Schubert nun, sich als Bühnenkomponist zu etablieren, wurde aber in seinen Hoffnungen enttäuscht. Sowohl Alfonso und Estrella – komponiert zwischen September 1821 und Februar 1822 – als auch Die Verschworenen nach Ignaz Franz Castelli (April 1823) wurden vom Theater abgelehnt, Fierrabras (Herbst 1823) nach ersten Proben abgesetzt. Die Schauspielmusik zu Helmina von Chézys Rosamunde wurde zwar gut angenommen, das Stück selbst aber nach zwei Abenden abgesetzt. Schuberts Gesundheitszustand gab Anlass zu Spekulationen. Mit zunehmendem Alter wurde er korpulenter und neigte zu alkoholischen Exzessen. Die erste authentisch überlieferte Krankheit befiel ihn im Dezember 1822. Ein Krankenhausaufenthalt im Herbst 1823 brachte zwar Besserung, aber schon im nächsten Frühjahr scheint die Krankheit den Komponisten psychisch besonders schwer belastet zu haben („ich fühle mich als den unglücklichsten, elendsten Menschen der Welt“ schrieb er an Leopold Kupelwieser). Nach gängiger Auffassung der Schubertforschung hatte sich Schubert damals eine venerische Erkrankung zugezogen, wohl Syphilis, denn er befand sich im Jänner 1823 zu stationärer Behandlung im Wiener Allgemeinen Krankenhaus wegen syphilitischer Geschwüre. Über Schuberts Lebensweise dieser Zeit kursieren verschiedene Legenden. So heißt es, dass Schubert das meiste für Schuldienst oder verkaufte Kompositionen eingenommene Geld für Abende im Freundeskreis in den Altwiener Gasthäusern ausgab, was seinem Ruf nicht gerade förderlich gewesen sei. Einer ungesicherten Anekdote zur Folge nahm der Wirt sogar hin und wieder ein Lied in Zahlung, das Schubert oft gleich am Wirtshaustisch komponierte, wenn er die Rechnung nicht bar bezahlen konnte. Weiter heißt es über Schuberts Arbeitseifer, dass er nachts stets seine gewohnten Augengläser aufbehielt, damit er am Morgen gleich ohne Zeitverlust zu komponieren beginnen konnte. Trotz seiner Beschäftigung mit der Bühne und später mit seinen offiziellen Pflichten fand er während dieser Jahre die Zeit für viele andere Kompositionen. 1822 wurde die Messe Nr. 5 As-Dur beendet und die Sinfonie in h-Moll begonnen. Sein erster berühmter Liederzyklus, Die schöne Müllerin, stammt aus dem Jahr 1823, die Variationen auf Trockne Blumen und zwei Streichquartette in a-Moll (Rosamunde) und d-Moll (Der Tod und das Mädchen) stammen aus dem Jahr 1824. Im Frühjahr 1824 schrieb er sein Oktett F-Dur. Von Ende Mai bis Mitte Oktober 1824 war er zum zweiten Mal in Zelis engagiert. Er widmete der 19-jährigen Komtesse Caroline Esterházy die drei Lieder „Ungeduld“, „Morgengruß“ und „Des Müllers Blumen“ aus der Schönen Müllerin. Dort notierte Schubert auch die zweihändige Mélodie hongroise D 817 und arbeitete sie im Finale des vierhändigen Divertissement à la Hongroise D 818 aus, das wohl nach der Rückkehr aus Zelis entstand. In Zelis entstand ferner die vierhändige Klaviersonate D 812, das Grand Duo. Auf Vorschlag von Gräfin Rosine Esterházy vertonte er das „Gebet“ von Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué als Vokalquartett. Im Jahr 1825 hatte Schubert noch einmal eine glücklichere Phase, in die eine Reise nach Oberösterreich fiel. Dort arbeitete er an der Großen Sinfonie C-Dur und schrieb seine Klaviersonate D-Dur (D 850); wohl bereits kurz zuvor war die Klaviersonate a-Moll (D 845) entstanden, die er zu einem recht hohen Preis veröffentlichen konnte. Er schloss Freundschaft mit Eduard von Bauernfeld. Weiterhin pflegte er seine Kontakte zu Anselm Hüttenbrenner und Johann Baptist Jenger, den Freunden in der Steiermark. Die letzten Jahre Von 1826 bis 1828 hielt sich Schubert – abgesehen von einem kurzen Aufenthalt in Graz – in Wien und seinen Vorstädten auf. Die Stelle des Vizekapellmeisters an der kaiserlichen Hofkapelle, um die er sich 1826 bewarb, wurde nicht an ihn, sondern an Joseph Weigl vergeben. Am 26. März 1828 gab er das einzige öffentliche Konzert seiner Karriere, das ihm 800 Gulden Wiener Währung (320 fl. Konventionsmünze) einbrachte. Zahlreiche Lieder und Klavierwerke waren inzwischen gedruckt worden. Die endgültige Fassung des Streichquartetts d-Moll mit den Variationen auf Der Tod und das Mädchen schrieb er während des Winters 1825/1826. 1826 folgten das Streichquartett G-Dur, das Rondeau brillant für Klavier und Violine, die Klaviersonate in G-Dur sowie Schuberts bekanntestes geistliches Werk, die Deutsche Messe. 1827 komponierte er den Liederzyklus Winterreise, die Impromptus, die Fantasie für Klavier und Violine und die beiden Klaviertrios in B-Dur und Es-Dur. 1828 schrieb er die Messe Nr. 6 Es-Dur, das Streichquintett C-Dur (D 956), die zusammengehörigen letzten drei Klaviersonaten (D 958–960) und eine Liedersammlung, die nach seinem Tod veröffentlicht und Schwanengesang genannt wurde. Ferner skizzierte er noch drei Sätze für eine Sinfonie in D-Dur. Tod Nach zwei Wochen kontinuierlichen Fiebers starb Franz Schubert am 19. November 1828 um 3 Uhr nachmittags in der Wohnung seines Bruders Ferdinand Schubert im Haus „Auf der neuen Wieden N° 694“ (heute Kettenbrückengasse 6 im Bezirk Wieden). Er litt noch unter der nicht geheilten Syphilis, doch dürfte die Todesursache eine akute Infektionskrankheit gewesen sein, wahrscheinlich Typhus. Diese Krankheit wurde damals „Nervenfieber“ genannt. Schubert wurde auf dem Währinger Friedhof in der Nähe von Ludwig van Beethovens Grab bestattet. 1888 wurden seine Gebeine in ein Ehrengrab auf dem Wiener Zentralfriedhof überführt (Gruppe 32 A, Nummer 28). |

Sowohl Alfonso und Estrella – komponiert zwischen September 1821 und Februar 1822 – als auch Die Verschworenen nach Ignaz Franz Castelli (April 1823) wurden vom Theater abgelehnt, Fierrabras (Herbst 1823) nach ersten Proben abgesetzt. Die Schauspielmusik zu Helmina von Chézys Rosamunde wurde zwar gut angenommen, das Stück selbst aber nach zwei Abenden abgesetzt. Schuberts Gesundheitszustand gab Anlass zu Spekulationen. Mit zunehmendem Alter wurde er korpulenter und neigte zu alkoholischen Exzessen. Die erste authentisch überlieferte Krankheit befiel ihn im Dezember 1822. Ein Krankenhausaufenthalt im Herbst 1823 brachte zwar Besserung, aber schon im nächsten Frühjahr scheint die Krankheit den Komponisten psychisch besonders schwer belastet zu haben („ich fühle mich als den unglücklichsten, elendsten Menschen der Welt“ schrieb er an Leopold Kupelwieser). Nach gängiger Auffassung der Schubertforschung hatte sich Schubert damals eine venerische Erkrankung zugezogen, wohl Syphilis, denn er befand sich im Jänner 1823 zu stationärer Behandlung im Wiener Allgemeinen Krankenhaus wegen syphilitischer Geschwüre. Über Schuberts Lebensweise dieser Zeit kursieren verschiedene Legenden. So heißt es, dass Schubert das meiste für Schuldienst oder verkaufte Kompositionen eingenommene Geld für Abende im Freundeskreis in den Altwiener Gasthäusern ausgab, was seinem Ruf nicht gerade förderlich gewesen sei. Einer ungesicherten Anekdote zur Folge nahm der Wirt sogar hin und wieder ein Lied in Zahlung, das Schubert oft gleich am Wirtshaustisch komponierte, wenn er die Rechnung nicht bar bezahlen konnte. Weiter heißt es über Schuberts Arbeitseifer, dass er nachts stets seine gewohnten Augengläser aufbehielt, damit er am Morgen gleich ohne Zeitverlust zu komponieren beginnen konnte. Trotz seiner Beschäftigung mit der Bühne und später mit seinen offiziellen Pflichten fand er während dieser Jahre die Zeit für viele andere Kompositionen. 1822 wurde die Messe Nr. 5 As-Dur beendet und die Sinfonie in h-Moll begonnen. Sein erster berühmter Liederzyklus, Die schöne Müllerin, stammt aus dem Jahr 1823, die Variationen auf Trockne Blumen und zwei Streichquartette in a-Moll (Rosamunde) und d-Moll (Der Tod und das Mädchen) stammen aus dem Jahr 1824. Im Frühjahr 1824 schrieb er sein Oktett F-Dur. Von Ende Mai bis Mitte Oktober 1824 war er zum zweiten Mal in Zelis engagiert. Er widmete der 19-jährigen Komtesse Caroline Esterházy die drei Lieder „Ungeduld“, „Morgengruß“ und „Des Müllers Blumen“ aus der Schönen Müllerin. Dort notierte Schubert auch die zweihändige Mélodie hongroise D 817 und arbeitete sie im Finale des vierhändigen Divertissement à la Hongroise D 818 aus, das wohl nach der Rückkehr aus Zelis entstand. In Zelis entstand ferner die vierhändige Klaviersonate D 812, das Grand Duo. Auf Vorschlag von Gräfin Rosine Esterházy vertonte er das „Gebet“ von Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué als Vokalquartett. Im Jahr 1825 hatte Schubert noch einmal eine glücklichere Phase, in die eine Reise nach Oberösterreich fiel. Dort arbeitete er an der Großen Sinfonie C-Dur und schrieb seine Klaviersonate D-Dur (D 850); wohl bereits kurz zuvor war die Klaviersonate a-Moll (D 845) entstanden, die er zu einem recht hohen Preis veröffentlichen konnte. Er schloss Freundschaft mit Eduard von Bauernfeld. Weiterhin pflegte er seine Kontakte zu Anselm Hüttenbrenner und Johann Baptist Jenger, den Freunden in der Steiermark. Die letzten Jahre Von 1826 bis 1828 hielt sich Schubert – abgesehen von einem kurzen Aufenthalt in Graz – in Wien und seinen Vorstädten auf. Die Stelle des Vizekapellmeisters an der kaiserlichen Hofkapelle, um die er sich 1826 bewarb, wurde nicht an ihn, sondern an Joseph Weigl vergeben. Am 26. März 1828 gab er das einzige öffentliche Konzert seiner Karriere, das ihm 800 Gulden Wiener Währung (320 fl. Konventionsmünze) einbrachte. Zahlreiche Lieder und Klavierwerke waren inzwischen gedruckt worden. Die endgültige Fassung des Streichquartetts d-Moll mit den Variationen auf Der Tod und das Mädchen schrieb er während des Winters 1825/1826. 1826 folgten das Streichquartett G-Dur, das Rondeau brillant für Klavier und Violine, die Klaviersonate in G-Dur sowie Schuberts bekanntestes geistliches Werk, die Deutsche Messe. 1827 komponierte er den Liederzyklus Winterreise, die Impromptus, die Fantasie für Klavier und Violine und die beiden Klaviertrios in B-Dur und Es-Dur. 1828 schrieb er die Messe Nr. 6 Es-Dur, das Streichquintett C-Dur (D 956), die zusammengehörigen letzten drei Klaviersonaten (D 958–960) und eine Liedersammlung, die nach seinem Tod veröffentlicht und Schwanengesang genannt wurde. Ferner skizzierte er noch drei Sätze für eine Sinfonie in D-Dur. Tod Nach zwei Wochen kontinuierlichen Fiebers starb Franz Schubert am 19. November 1828 um 3 Uhr nachmittags in der Wohnung seines Bruders Ferdinand Schubert im Haus „Auf der neuen Wieden N° 694“ (heute Kettenbrückengasse 6 im Bezirk Wieden). Er litt noch unter der nicht geheilten Syphilis, doch dürfte die Todesursache eine akute Infektionskrankheit gewesen sein, wahrscheinlich Typhus. Diese Krankheit wurde damals „Nervenfieber“ genannt. Schubert wurde auf dem Währinger Friedhof in der Nähe von Ludwig van Beethovens Grab bestattet. 1888 wurden seine Gebeine in ein Ehrengrab auf dem Wiener Zentralfriedhof überführt (Gruppe 32 A, Nummer 28). |
G;|Jane Seymour (* um 1509; † 24. Oktober 1537 im Hampton Court Palace, London) war die dritte der sechs Ehefrauen des englischen Königs Heinrich VIII. Da sie niemals offiziell gekrönt wurde, war sie für die siebzehn Monate ihrer Ehe offiziell lediglich Royal Consort von England und Irland. Obwohl sie nicht so viel Einfluss ausübte wie ihre Vorgängerinnen Katharina von Aragón und Anne Boleyn, war sie als gläubige Katholikin die große Hoffnung der konservativen Partei bei Hofe, die Reformation einzudämmen und Prinzessin Maria zu rehabilitieren, und versuchte, für die Rebellen der Pilgrimage of Grace einzutreten. Sie ist die Mutter des einzigen männlichen Thronfolgers Heinrichs VIII. und späteren Königs Eduard VI. und starb nach seiner Geburt am Kindbettfieber.  Einführung bei Hofe Jane Seymour war das fünfte von zehn Kindern und die älteste Tochter Sir John Seymours von Wiltshire († 1536) und Margaret Wentworths († 1550). Sie war die Schwester von Thomas Seymour und Edward Seymour. Aus ihrem frühen Leben ist nicht viel bekannt. Im Jahr 1529 oder 1530 wurde sie am englischen Hofe eingeführt. Zunächst war sie Hofdame von Katharina von Aragón und später von Anne Boleyn. Es ist unbekannt, ob sie im Zuge der Haushaltskürzungen für Katharina zunächst den Hof verlassen musste und später von Anne Boleyn neu angestellt wurde oder ob sie Anne von Anfang an diente. Bekannt ist lediglich, dass sie zu Neujahr 1534 bereits zu Annes Damen gehörte und von ihr ein Geschenk erhielt. Gerüchten zufolge hatte Jane Seymours Vetter zweiten Grades Francis Bryan Anne empfohlen, Jane von Katharina zu übernehmen. Jane Dormer, eine Hofdame der Königin Maria I. behauptete später, Jane Seymour wäre von Bryan an den Hof gebracht worden, nachdem Verhandlungen über eine Ehe zwischen ihr und William Dormer gescheitert waren. Allerdings gibt es keine historisch schlüssigen Beweise für Bryans Mitwirkung. Der spanische Botschafter Eustace Chapuys schrieb über sie und ihre Familie: „Sie ist die Schwester eines gewissen Edward Seymour, der seiner Majestät (Karl V.) gedient hat, während sie selbst zuvor im Dienst der guten Königin (Katharina von Aragón) stand.“ Im Jahr 1535 besuchte König Heinrich VIII. während seiner Sommerreise Wolf Hall, die Residenz der Seymours und blieb dort für fünf Tage. Entgegen einer verbreiteten Legende traf Heinrich hier allerdings nicht das erste Mal auf Jane. Es ist nicht einmal gewiss, ob Jane zu diesem Zeitpunkt überhaupt in Wolf Hall war. Beziehung zu Heinrich Einen ersten Hinweis auf Janes Verhältnis zu Heinrich gibt es ebenfalls von Chapuys. Nachdem Anne Boleyn im Januar 1536 eine weitere Fehlgeburt hatte, kam es zu einer heftigen Auseinandersetzung zwischen ihr und Heinrich, in deren Verlauf sie ihm vorwarf, dass ihre Fehlgeburt aufgrund ihrer großen Liebe zu ihm geschehen war. „Ihr Herz brach“, schrieb Chapuys, „als sie sah, dass er andere liebte.“ Der Botschafter berichtet zudem von „einer Dame bei Hofe namens Mistress Semel [Seymour], an die, wie viele sagen, in letzter Zeit viele Geschenke gingen.“ Allerdings dürfte es sich bei der Liebe des Königs zu ihr anfangs um nichts weiter als eine heftige Schwärmerei gehandelt haben. Heinrich und Anne Boleyn hatten bereits eine Tochter, die spätere Elisabeth I. Die beiden folgenden Geburten waren zwar männliche Kinder, die aber tot und zu früh zur Welt kamen. Heinrichs Druck auf Anne wurde somit immer größer, ihm endlich den ersehnten Thronfolger zu gebären. Da Anne durch den erhöhten Druck und die beiden Totgeburten immer mehr verzweifelte, war sie auch für Heinrich VIII. keine angenehme oder reizvolle Partnerin mehr. Hinzu kam, dass seine geschiedene erste Ehefrau, Katharina von Aragon, zu Beginn des Jahres 1536 gestorben war. Zu ihren Lebzeiten hatte Heinrich sich bereits rechtlich beraten lassen, ob er im Falle einer Scheidung von Anne zu Katharina zurückkehren müsste. Die Eheschließung mit Anne Boleyn hatte stattgefunden, bevor Thomas Cranmer, Erzbischof von Canterbury, die Ehe mit Katharina offiziell als ungültig erklärte, weshalb Heinrich streng genommen eine Zeitlang in Bigamie gelebt hatte. Katharinas Fürsprecher argumentierten, dass der König unter diesen Umständen keine rechtskräftige Ehe hatte eingehen können und nach wie vor mit Katharina verheiratet war. Ihr Tod hingegen gab ihm nun die Freiheit, nach Beendigung seiner Ehe zu Anne Boleyn eine neue Frau zu wählen. Zeitgenossen behaupteten, Anne Boleyn hätte Jane auf dem Schoß des Königs ertappt, was zu ihrer letzten Fehlgeburt geführt hätte. Da allerdings erst einen Monat später Heinrichs Interesse an Jane offensichtlich wurde - Chapuys nannte sie im Februar „die junge Dame, der der König dient“ - halten Historiker dieses Szenario für eine Legende. Anne Boleyns Feinde, insbesondere Sir Nicholas Carew, unterstützten Jane darin, Annes Platz einzunehmen. Sie ermutigten sie, sich dem König als Geliebte zu verweigern, wie Anne Boleyn es einst getan hatte. Es ist gut möglich, dass es der konservativen Fraktion hauptsächlich darum ging, Prinzessin Maria wieder in die Thronfolge einzugliedern, und dass für sie die Liebe des Königs zu Jane lediglich Mittel zum Zweck war. Chapuys zufolge wurde Jane regelmäßig von Nicholas Carew unterwiesen und er selbst unterstützte Jane mit Marias Zustimmung ebenfalls. Bereits vor ihrer Beziehung zu Heinrich hatte Jane Seymour Maria eine Nachricht zukommen lassen, die Prinzessin möge „guten Mutes sein und ihre Schwierigkeiten würden schneller vorbei sein als sie ahnte und sobald sich die Gelegenheit ergäbe, würde sie [Jane] sich als treue und hingebungsvolle Dienerin erweisen.“ Carew instruierte Jane, „den Wünschen des Königs auf keinen Fall nachzukommen, außer durch Heirat“. Als Heinrich Jane Seymour Mitte März ein Geldgeschenk und einen Brief sandte, handelte Jane genauso, wie es ihre Freunde gehofft hatten. Sie küsste den Brief und übergab ihn und die Geldbörse ungeöffnet zurück an den Boten. Die meisten Historiker halten ihr Verhalten für kalkulierte Schauspielerei.Heinrich jedoch war zutiefst beeindruckt von Janes Tugend und erklärte, er würde sie in Zukunft als Beweis für seine ehrenvollen Absichten lediglich in Anwesenheit ihrer Angehörigen sprechen. Der Minister Thomas Cromwell stellte Jane Seymour bei Hofe seine eigenen Gemächer zur Verfügung, die durch geheime Gänge mit denen des Königs verbunden waren. Janes Bruder Edward und seine Ehefrau fungierten als Aufsichtspersonen, wann immer der König Jane sehen wollte. Während die Untersuchungen gegen Anne Boleyn liefen, wurde Jane vorübergehend im Haus von Sir Nicholas Carew einquartiert und kurz vor der Gerichtsverhandlung bezog sie Chelsea, das ehemalige Haus von Sir Thomas More. Unmittelbar nach Anne Boleyns Hinrichtung machte der König Jane einen Heiratsantrag und sie nahm ihn an. Königsgemahlin Obwohl Anne Boleyn beim Volk recht unbeliebt gewesen war, wäre eine zu schnelle Wiederverheiratung des Königs als unpassend empfunden worden. Hinzu kam, dass Jane Seymour weitgehend unbekannt war und sich viele fragten, wie sie den König für sich eingenommen hatte. Chapuys schrieb am 18. Mai an den kaiserlichen Minister Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle und gab ihm darin einen kurzen, etwas zynischen Abriss von Jane Seymour: Am 30. Mai 1536 folgte die Vermählung in einem privaten Gemach der Königin im Palace of Whitehall und am 4. Juni 1536 wurde Jane zur englischen Königin ausgerufen. Doch wurde sie nie zur Königin gekrönt, möglicherweise, weil Heinrich zuerst die Geburt eines Sohnes abwarten wollte. Auf alle Fälle wurde die Krönung aus Kostengründen auf das letzte Quartal 1536 verschoben, dann wegen des Ausbruchs der Pest und aufgrund von Aufständen im Norden des Landes nicht durchgeführt. Die als passiv, freundlich und unterwürfig beschriebene Jane stellte einen großen Kontrast zu der energischen, widerspenstigen Anne Boleyn dar. Als Motto wählte sie „Zum Gehorchen und Dienen bestimmt“ (engl. „Bound to obey and serve“). Während ihr Vater einen Pfau als Wappentier führte, bevorzugte Jane den Phönix, nach damaliger Auffassung ein Symbol der Selbstaufopferung. Sir John Russell schrieb an seinen Freund Lord Lisle: „Ich versichere Euch, Mylord, sie ist die freundlichste Dame, die ich jemals kennenlernte und die redlichste Königin der Christenheit. Der König ist aus der Hölle in den Himmel gekommen, wegen der Güte in dieser und des Fluches und des Unglücks in der anderen.“ Dennoch sehen Historiker heutzutage ein differenzierteres Bild von Jane. Ihre nach außen hin sichtbare Sanftmut steht im Gegensatz zu ihrem Durchhaltevermögen und den starken Nerven, die sie als Anne Boleyns Rivalin bewies. Ein weiteres Mal stellte sie diese Charaktereigenschaften unter Beweis, als sie sich für die zum Bastard erklärte Prinzessin Maria einsetzte. Trotz seines abwertenden Briefes über Jane bemühte sich Chapuys um ein gutes Verhältnis zu der neuen Königin in der Hoffnung, dass sie Maria rehabilitieren würde. Doch als sie ihrem Ehemann gegenüber das Thema zur Sprache brachte, fuhr Heinrich sie ärgerlich an. Sie sei eine Närrin und solle sich lieber um den Aufstieg ihrer eigenen Kinder kümmern, nicht um den anderer. Jane entgegnete, dass sie lediglich den Frieden innerhalb der königlichen Familie und des Landes sichern wolle. Als Heinrich und Cromwell Maria unter Druck setzten, offiziell ihre eigene Illegitimität und die Ungültigkeit der Ehe ihrer Eltern anzuerkennen, bat Jane den König auf Knien, seiner Tochter zu vergeben. Heinrich jedoch wies sie scharf zurecht. Maria wurde erst gestattet an den Hof zurückzukehren, nachdem sie sich dem Willen ihres Vaters völlig unterworfen hatte. Bei ihrem ersten Treffen schenkte Jane der Prinzessin einen Diamanten. Dennoch konnte sie Heinrich nicht überzeugen, seine älteste Tochter wieder in die Thronfolge einzugliedern. Stattdessen erhielten per Parlamentsbeschluss Janes Nachkommen den ersten Anspruch auf den Thron. Als Königin wird Jane als streng, konservativ und förmlich beschrieben. Die junge Anne Basset, die aus Calais an den Hof gesandt wurde, musste auf Befehl der Königin die englische Giebelhaube tragen statt der von Anne Boleyn eingeführten französischen Haube und nach wenigen Wochen waren auch ihre französischen Kleider nicht mehr erlaubt. Als es im Norden zu Aufständen kam, rückte die königliche Familie enger zusammen. Sowohl Maria als auch ihre Halbschwester Elisabeth wurden an den Hof berufen und es entstand zum ersten Mal eine Art Familienleben. Mit ihrer Schwägerin Anne Stanhope und ihrer Schwester Elizabeth Seymour unterhielt Jane ebenfalls eine enge und herzliche Beziehung. Für gewöhnlich mischte Jane sich nicht in die Politik ihres Mannes ein. Die Ausnahmen waren Prinzessin Maria und die Pilgrimage of Grace. Während Cromwell und der König den Aufstand niederschlagen lassen wollten, flehte Jane ihren Mann auf Knien um Gnade für die Rebellen an. Dieser jedoch erinnerte sie an das Schicksal der letzten Königin, die sich in seine Politik einmischte. Geburt des Thronfolgers und Tod Im Jahr 1537 wurde Jane schwanger. Am 27. Mai wurde ihre Schwangerschaft öffentlich bekannt gemacht und in der St Paul’s Cathedral wurde ein Te Deum gesungen. Ihre Stieftochter Maria wurde an den Hof berufen, um Jane behilflich zu sein. Aufgrund ihrer Schwangerschaft sagte Heinrich seine geplante Reise in den Norden ab mit der Begründung, dass sie in ihrem Zustand zu ängstlich war, ihn gehen zu lassen. Möglicherweise war es lediglich ein Vorwand, da die Aufstände im Norden erst vor wenigen Wochen drakonisch niedergeschlagen worden waren. Während ihrer Schwangerschaft soll sie einen Heißhunger auf Wachteln entwickelt haben, die der König extra für sie aus Flandern bestellte. Maria, zu der Jane ein herzliches Verhältnis aufgebaut hatte, sandte der Königin selbst Wachteln und Gurken aus ihrem eigenen Garten. Im September begann Jane sich aufgrund ihrer fortgeschrittenen Schwangerschaft vom Hofleben zurückzuziehen. Nachmittags am 9. Oktober 1537 setzten die ersten Wehen ein und erst am 12. Oktober 1537 gebar Jane den Thronerben Eduard im Palast zu Hampton Court. Heinrich soll beim Anblick seines Sohnes angeblich vor Freude geweint haben. Jane war nach der Geburt wohlauf und konnte ihren Sohn nach seiner Taufe am 15. Oktober wieder in Empfang nehmen. Aufgrund der Reinheitsgebote war es ihr noch nicht gestattet, ein Gotteshaus zu betreten und somit fand die Taufe in ihrer Abwesenheit statt. Anlässlich der Geburt eines gesunden Sohnes wurde Janes Bruder Edward zum Earl of Hertford ernannt. Kurze Zeit später erkrankte Jane sehr schwer an Kindbettfieber und bekam starke Blutungen. Am Freitag, den 19. Oktober, wurde in St Paul's Cathedral ein weiterer Gottesdienst abgehalten, um für die Königin zu beten. Während des 23. Oktobers schien es ihr etwas besser zu gehen, doch in der Nacht wurde sie erneut von der Krankheit heimgesucht. Am 24. Oktober 1537 starb Jane Seymour, zwölf Tage nach der Geburt ihres Sohnes und weniger als 18 Monate nach der Proklamation zur englischen Königin. Es ist unbekannt, ob Heinrich an ihrem Sterbebett war, da er vorgehabt hatte, am 25. Oktober nach Esher zu reisen. Russell schreibt: Heinrich ordnete für den ganzen englischen Hof Staatstrauer bis zum 2. Januar 1538 an. Janes Leichnam wurde einbalsamiert und im Bleisarg in langer Prozession nach Schloss Windsor überführt, um dort die letzte Ruhestätte zu finden. Auf dem Sarg befand sich eine gekrönte Statue Jane Seymours in königlichen Gewändern und mit Zepter ausgestattet. Der Trauerzug wurde von Maria als Chief Mourner angeführt und auch Heinrichs Nichten Frances Brandon und Margaret Douglas erwiesen der Königin die letzte Ehre. In Janes Epitaph wurde Bezug auf ihr Wappentier, den Phönix, genommen: Phoenix Jana iacet, nato Phoenice ; dolendum, Secula Phoenices nulla tulisse duas. Die Übersetzung lautet sinngemäß: Here lies Jane, a Phoenix, by whose death Another Phoenix life gave breath: It is to be lamented much The world at once ne'er knew two such. Hier liegt Jane, ein Phönix, durch dessen Tod Ein anderer Phönix den Lebensatem erhielt: Es ist wahrlich zu beklagen, Dass die Welt niemals zwei dieser Art auf einmal erblickte. Heinrich VIII. trauerte sehr um Jane und fiel in eine tiefe Depression. Noch später erzählte er, dass er von seinen Frauen Jane am meisten geliebt habe. Historiker vermuten, dass diese Aussage vor allem darauf zurückgeht, dass Jane dem König den erwarteten Thronerben gebar. Erst 1540 heiratete er seine vierte Frau Anna von Kleve. Die Suche nach einer geeigneten neuen Gemahlin für Heinrich begann allerdings schon 1537/38. 1545, als Maria und Elisabeth offiziell wieder in die Thronfolge aufgenommen wurden, ließ Heinrich zur Erinnerung an dieses Ereignis ein Familienporträt anfertigen. In diesem Bild bestand der König darauf, anstelle seiner derzeitigen Ehefrau Catherine Parr Jane Seymour in das Porträt malen zu lassen. Als er 1547 starb, fand er in Windsor Castle an der Seite von Jane seine letzte Ruhestätte. Janes Familie stand auch nach ihrem Tod hoch in der Gunst des Königs und später seines Sohnes Eduard. Insbesondere ihre Brüder Edward und Thomas Seymour profitierten von ihrer Verwandtschaft zu dem jungen König. |
G;|Jeanbon (de) St. André (eigentlich André Jeanbon; * 25. Februar 1749 in Montauban; † 10. Dezember 1813 in Mainz), Baron de St. André seit 1809, war seit 1801 unter Napoleon Bonaparte Generalkommissar der vier im Jahr 1798 errichteten linksrheinischen Départements. Seit Februar 1802 war er französischer Präfekt des Département du Mont-Tonnerre (Donnersberg) mit Sitz in Mainz. Jeanbon St. André prägte nachhaltig Mainz und das ihm unterstellte Département in der Zeit der Zugehörigkeit zum Konsulat und zum Empire. Er erkrankte an Fleckfieber, einer epidemischen Krankheit, die das geschlagene französische Heer (ca. 50.000 Mann) nach der Völkerschlacht bei Leipzig bei ihrem Rheinübergang Anfang November 1813 auch nach Mainz einschleppte, wo die Seuche Tausende Soldaten und Zivilisten das Leben kostete. Dort starb André Jeanbon am 10. Dezember 1813 und wurde auf dem von ihm angelegten Hauptfriedhof begraben.  Vor der französischen Revolution André Jeanbon wurde am 25. Februar 1749 in Montauban, Quercy geboren. Er war der zweite Sohn des protestantischen Walkmüllers Antoine Jeanbon und seiner Frau Marie, geborene Molles. Sein Geburtshaus in der Grand Rue Villenouvelle Nummer 40 trägt eine Erinnerungstafel. Die französischen Protestanten konnten ihre Religion nach dem Edikt von Fontainebleau nur im Untergrund ausüben. So wurde auch André katholisch getauft. Nach seiner Erziehung in der örtlichen Jesuitenschule 1759 bis 1765 wollte er zunächst Advokat werden, eine Laufbahn, die ihm als Protestanten im katholisch-royalistischen Frankreich der Vorrevolutionszeit allerdings versperrt blieb. Nach einer Ausbildung zum Steuermann in Bordeaux von 1765 bis 1766 fuhr er bis 1771 zur See und brachte es bis zum Kapitän der Handelsmarine. Er überlebte insgesamt drei Schiffbrüche, verlor allerdings bei einem Schiffbruch in der Karibik 1771 (wahrscheinlich vor Hispaniola) seine gesamten Ersparnisse. Nach diesem Vorfall entschloss sich André Jeanbon zum Studium der reformierten Theologie. Dieses absolvierte er in der Hälfte der sonst üblichen Studienzeit von 1771 bis 1773 am Französischen [Theologischen] Seminar in Lausanne in der Schweiz (1729–1812). Dies ist nicht der Universität verbunden. In seinem Gebäude ist heute das kantonale Gymnasium. Mit 24 Jahren wurde er am 21. April 1773 in Lausanne zum Pfarrer ordiniert und änderte seinen Namen in Jeanbon de Saint-André. Da es an Pfarrern mangelte, bekam er noch Ende April seine erste Stelle als illegaler Pfarrer in Castres, heute Département Tarn von 1773 bis 1783 ohne Kirche oder Betsaal, die Gottesdienste fanden geheim im Freien statt. Hier heiratete er am 24. Juni 1778 die Demoiselle Marie de Suc aus Castres. Für die Zeit nach 1783 sind seine Aufenthaltsorte unbekannt. Er lebte wohl im Verborgenen schrieb aber in dieser Zeit seine Considérations sur l’organisation civile des Églises protestantes, die erst 1848 von dem Katholiken Auguste Nicolas veröffentlicht wurde. Nach dem Toleranz-Edikt von Versailles vom 29. November 1787 wurde er vom Konsistorium zum 1. Juli 1788 in seine Heimatstadt Montauban berufen. Dort wirkte er bis 1790 als Pfarrer und erlebte den Ausbruch der Französischen Revolution. Jeanbon St. André und die französische Revolution Mit dem Revolutionsjahr 1789 begann Jeanbon St. André, sich politisch zu betätigen. In seiner Heimatstadt wurde er zum Präsidenten des Jakobinerclubs gewählt. Am 6. September 1792 wurde er als Abgeordneter des Département Lot in die Nationalversammlung in Paris gewählt. Ihr gehörte er von 1792 bis 1795 an und war kurzzeitig, vom 11. bis 25. Juli 1793, ihr Präsident. Er galt als einer der hervorragendsten Redner der Nationalversammlung und als einer ihrer engagiertesten Arbeiter. Der französische Historiker Hippolyte Taine beschrieb St. Andrés Erscheinung in dieser Lebensphase wie folgt: „Er hat Holzschuhe und eine wollene Jakobinerjacke an, ißt ein Stück hausbackenen Brotes, trinkt ein Glas schlechten Bieres und schreibt und diktiert bis ihm die Kräfte versagen; dann wirft er sich um zu schlafen auf eine am Boden liegende Matratze.“ Politisch war St. André ein Parteigänger Robespierres. Er gehörte der Fraktion der Montagnards an und stimmte zusammen mit diesen für die Todesstrafe für Ludwig XVI.. 1793 bis 1794 war er außerdem gewähltes Mitglied des Wohlfahrtsausschusses (frz. Comité de salut public, „Ausschuss der öffentlichen Wohlfahrt und der allgemeinen Verteidigung“). In dieser Funktion war er der Volks-Repräsentant bei der Nordarmee. Nach den militärischen Misserfolgen der Revolutionsarmee im Juli 1793 bei Mainz betraute man ihn mit der Aufgabe, die Lage bei der Armee im Norden zu stabilisieren. Außerdem wurde er mit der Reorganisation der Militärhäfen in Brest und Cherbourg beauftragt. Als Marinekommissar des Wohlfahrtsausschusses nahm er Ende Mai/Anfang Juni 1794 an der Sicherung eines Lebensmittelkonvois teil, bei der es zur Seeschlacht am 13. Prairial zwischen französischen und britischen Schiffen kam, bei der er leicht verwundet wurde. Die französischen Schiffe sollten einem amerikanischen Konvoi unter Konteradmiral Pierre Jean Van Stabel sicheres Geleit geben. Weitere Aufgaben führten St. André nach Toulon und Marseille. Dem Umstand, dass er deshalb am 9. Thermidor nicht in Paris weilte, verdankte er als Parteigänger Robespierres wahrscheinlich sein Leben: Er entging so der Säuberungswelle zum Ende der Terrorherrschaft und musste nicht das Schicksal Robespierres und seiner Gefolgsleute teilen, die beinahe ausnahmslos unter der Guillotine endeten. Stattdessen wurde er am 28. Mai 1795 verhaftet. Während dieser Gefangenschaft entstand sein Porträt von der Hand des berühmten französischen Malers Jacques-Louis David. Jeanbon St. André kam bereits am 26. Oktober 1795 aufgrund einer Amnestie frei und wurde als Konsul nach Algier und Smyrna (1798) auf diplomatische Mission geschickt. In Smyrna wurde er allerdings von den Türken verhaftet und von 1798 bis 1801 gefangen gehalten. Nach seiner Rückkehr nach Paris 1801 bot ihm Napoleon Bonaparte, mittlerweile Erster Konsul der Republik, den Posten eines Generalkommissars der 1800 neu gegründeten vier linksrheinischen Départements (darunter das Département du Mont-Tonnerre) sowie die Präfektur mit Sitz im nunmehr französischen Mayence (Mainz) an. Napoleon Bonaparte, Mayence und das Département du Mont-Tonnerre In der Folge der französischen Revolution gelangten seit 1792/93 große linksrheinische Teile von Andernach bis Basel unter französische Kontrolle. Die französische Herrschaft etablierte sich endgültig 1797 mit dem Friedensvertrag von Campo Formio zwischen Frankreich und Österreich. Napoleon Bonaparte, seit 1799 Erster Konsul der Republik und ab 1804 Kaiser der Franzosen, integrierte diese gewonnenen Gebiete nach und nach in die politischen Verwaltungsstrukturen der Republik bzw. des folgenden Kaiserreiches. So ließ er 1800 unter anderem das Département du Mont-Tonnerre gründen. Mainz wurde am 23. September 1802 nach dem Friedensvertrag von Lunéville als nunmehr französisches Mayence Hauptstadt des Départements, das aus großen Teilen des späteren Rheinhessen und Teilen der Pfalz bestand. Unter-Präfekturen des Départements waren die Arrondissements Mainz, Kaiserslautern, Speyer und Zweibrücken. Jeanbon St. André wurde am 10. Dezember 1801 zum ersten Präfekten des Départements ernannt, das bereits am 3. August 1802 zusammen mit den anderen linksrheinischen Départements den innerfranzösischen Départements rechtlich gleichgestellt wurde. Er widmete sich dieser Aufgabe, wie aus zeitgenössischen Berichten zu entnehmen ist, mit großem Engagement. Auch Napoleon hatte große Pläne mit der Hauptstadt des Départements: die Stadt sollte wichtige militärische Funktionen übernehmen, später auch als Kaiserresidenz dienen und „Schaufenster des Empire“ werden. In einem Dekret vom 22. Juni wurde die Erhebung von Mayence zu einer der 36 bedeutendsten Städte Frankreichs (bonnes villes de l’Empire) bekannt gegeben. Große bauliche Veränderungen im Stadtbild, geplant, aber nur teilweise realisiert von dem Départmement-Baudirektor J. F. Eustache de St. Far, waren die Folge. Die heutige Ludwigsstraße, damals Grande Rue Napoleon, ist das heute noch sichtbare Beispiel dieser Planungs- und Bauperiode. In diese Zeit fällt auch der endgültige Abbruch der gotischen Martinsburg und die Nutzung des ehemals Kurfürstlichen Schlosses als Waren- und Lagerplatz. Der Abriss des seit den Revolutionskriegen von 1793 stark beschädigten Mainzer Doms und der ausgebrannten Liebfrauenkirche am Dom wurde ebenfalls von St. André als zuständigem Präfekten vorangetrieben. Der 1802 von Napoleon ernannte neue Bischof von Mainz, Joseph Ludwig Colmar, konnte dies nach heftigen Auseinandersetzungen mit dem protestantischen Präfekten und nach Lancierung einer entsprechenden Order aus Paris an St. André jedoch verhindern. Colmar verhinderte auch den Abriss des Speyerer Doms. Weitere Pläne, unter anderem für die umfangreiche Befestigung von Mainz und Kastel sowie den Umbau und die Erweiterung des Deutschhauses zum kaiserlichen Residenzschloss (Palais Imperial), wurden nie realisiert. Aber auch in den ländlichen Gebieten des Départements kam es zu Veränderungen, die von St. André aus Mainz initiiert wurden. So wurde z. B. der Anbau von Zuckerrüben in der Pfalz auf Verordnung (kaiserliches Dekret vom 25. März 1811) erfolgreich etabliert und zu einem bedeutenden Wirtschaftsfaktor ausgebaut. Handel und Produktion wurden nicht nur in Mainz sondern auch in ländlichen Gegenden gefördert um den Nachschub für die Armee zu sichern und die Auswirkungen der Kontinentalsperre abzumildern. Jeanbon St. André als Präfekt in Mainz Jeanbon St. André, der im Erthaler Hof residierte, war als Präfekt bei den Mainzern zuerst nicht sehr beliebt. Ein notorisches Misstrauen der Mainzer Bevölkerung gegenüber der Obrigkeit und St. Andrés eiserner Wille bei der Umsetzung neuer Projekte und politischer Vorgaben aus Paris sorgten dafür. Auch St. Andrés ernsthafte Erwägung, den nach preußischem Artilleriebeschuss 1793 stark beschädigten Mainzer Dom abbrechen zu lassen, sorgte für Empörung. Sein großes Engagement bei der Fürsorge für die Kranken und Armen, Anstrengungen im Schulwesen in Mainz und im restlichen Département sowie sein persönlich bescheidenes, aber in seiner Arbeit effizientes Auftreten brachten ihm aber nach einiger Zeit sowohl bei den Mainzern als auch bei seinen französischen Landsleuten hohes Ansehen ein. Napoleon, zu dem er ein gutes Verhältnis hatte, nannte ihn das „Musterbeispiel eines Präfekten“ und machte ihn 1809 zu einem Grand notable de l’Empire mit Barontitel. Zusammen mit dem Maire (Bürgermeister) von Mayence, Franz Konrad Macké, setzte sich St. André vor allem für die Wiederbelebung des nach dem Ende des Kurfürstentums fast zusammengebrochenen Handels ein. Dazu wurde eine Handelskammer eingerichtet, zusammen mit Köln die älteste in Deutschland. Mainz behielt durch ein Dekret Napoleons, ausgestellt bei dessen erstem Aufenthalt in Mainz am 1. Oktober 1804, das alte Stapelrecht, das nun als entrepôt réel bezeichnet wurde. Im Februar 1809 wurde ein Freihafen eröffnet, den die Mainzer im Wesentlichen dem nachhaltigen politischen Einsatz ihres Präfekten und ihres Maires zu verdanken hatten. Es entstanden zusätzlich eine Zuckerraffinerie und eine Farbenfabrik sowie eine Baumwollweberei. Der Mainzer Handel kam unter französischer Herrschaft zu einer kurzen Blüte. Sie war nur von kurzer Dauer, weil das französische Mayence in den Augen Napoleons und der französischen Politik in erster Linie die östlichste Festung des Empire am Rhein war und gleichzeitig eine Hauptfunktion als Truppenaufmarschplatz nach Deutschland (Boulevard de l’Empire) wahrzunehmen hatte. Dem waren die wirtschaftlichen Interessen der Stadt unterzuordnen. Andererseits wurde unter dem Präfekt St. André auch das kulturelle Leben gefördert. Die Überlassung von 36 Gemälden aufgrund einer direkten Anweisung Napoleons sollte die Département-Hauptstadt Mayence kulturell aufwerten und die Bürgerschaft positiv stimmen. Diese Gemäldesammlung wurde aufgrund des Chaptal-Erlasses zum Grundstock des heutigen Landesmuseums Mainz, das 1803 gegründet wurde. „La Bibliothèque de Mayence est mise à la disposition de la commune“ – „Die Bibliothek von Mainz wird der Gemeinde zur Verfügung gestellt“. Mit diesem Kernsatz aus dem Dekret des französischen Innenministers Jean-Baptiste Nompère de Champagny vom 20. August 1805 an den Präfekten des Département du Mont-Tonnerre wurde ein neues Zeitalter der Mainzer Bibliotheksgeschichte begonnen. Die gesamte äußerst umfangreiche Bibliothek der 1798 aufgehobenen Mainzer Universität wurde der Stadt Mainz und damit der Mainzer Bürgerschaft übergeben. Hierdurch wurde der Grundstock für die heutige Stadtbibliothek gelegt. Während der Amtszeit St. Andrés expandierte Mainz und vergrößerte sein Stadtgebiet. So erreichte der Präfekt die Ausdehnung der Stadtgrenze von Mainz bis nach Bretzenheim unter gleichzeitiger Eingemeindung des bis dahin halbwegs selbständigen Zahlbach. In der Mainzer Zeitung konnte man am 26. August (8. Fructidor) 1805 zu diesem Ereignis lesen: Verbunden war damit die Einrichtung des neuen Mainzer Hauptfriedhofes durch St. André zwei Jahre zuvor. Im Zuge der französischen Revolution und Napoleons Machtübernahme kam es zur Säkularisation von Klöstern und Kirchen. Die aus dem Mittelalter stammende Tradition, Tote bei den Kirchen und Klöstern zu bestatten, konnte in dieser Form nicht mehr aufrechterhalten werden, da sie zunehmend zu hygienischen Problemen führte. Unter französischer Herrschaft wurde diese Bestattungsform von Toten innerhalb der Stadt verboten, so geschehen in Mainz durch zwei Dekrete von Jeanbon St. André vom 19. und vom 30. März 1803. Auf Anweisung des Präfekten kaufte die Stadt Mainz Gelände des ehemaligen Dalheimer Klosters für die neue außerstädtische Friedhofsanlage auf. Am 30. Mai 1803 wurde der neue „Aureus-Friedhof“ eingeweiht, auf dem 1813 auch Jeanbon St. André seine letzte Ruhe fand. Unter der Präfektur von St. André wurden auf Basis der Organischen Artikel erstmals seit der schwedischen Besetzungszeit wieder protestantische Gottesdienste in eigens ihnen überlassen Kirchengebäuden erlaubt. So feierten die Mainzer Protestanten im März 1802 in der ihnen überlassenen Altmünsterkirche erstmals wieder öffentlich ihren Gottesdienst. Über Mainz hinaus können auch noch heute die Nachwirkungen von Jeanbon St. Andrés Wirken beobachtet werden. So verfügte er, unter anderem um der Warenverknappung durch die Kontinentalsperre gegen England (1806) entgegenzuwirken, den Zuckerrübenanbau in der Pfalz, der dort neben dem Weinbau zu einem der wichtigsten wirtschaftlichen Faktoren wurde. St. André setzte sich auch für die Verbesserung des Straßenwesens ein. So wurde beispielsweise die Route Charlemagne gebaut, eine Fernstraße über Ingelheim nach Koblenz. Auch die heute noch in der Mainzer Oberstadt erhaltene Straßenbezeichnung Pariser Tor weist auf die direkte Fernstraßenverbindung (Pariser- oder Kaiserstraße) von Mainz über die Pfalz und Saarbrücken nach Paris hin, die damals auf Initiative des Präfekten gebaut wurde. Nach den Niederlagen der Grande Armée bei Leipzig und Hanau 1813 flüchteten die überlebenden Soldaten in Panik zurück zum Rhein und über die Mainzer Rheinbrücke in die Stadt hinein. Sie brachten den so genannten Typhus de Mayence mit, dem schätzungsweise über 16.000 französische Soldaten und knapp 2.500 Mainzer (10 % der Bevölkerung!) erlagen. Unter den Opfern war auch der Präfekt Jeanbon St. André. Er starb am 10. Dezember 1813, nachdem er sich um die Organisation der Kranken- und Verwundetenpflege verdient gemacht und sich selbst dabei nicht geschont hatte. Seine letzte Ruhestätte fand er in einem Ehrengrab auf dem von ihm gegründeten Mainzer Hauptfriedhof, wo noch heute ein aufwändig gestaltetes Grabmal an ihn erinnert. Die französische Inschrift des Grabsteins, verfasst von dem Mainzer Schriftsteller Friedrich Lehne, lautet übersetzt: Unter diesem Denkmal, einfach wie er, inmitten derer, die er liebte in der letzten Ruhestätte, geheiligt durch seine Fürsorge und unter seiner Verwaltung ruht J. B. Baron de St. André, Präfekt des Departements Donnersberg Offizier der Ehrenlegion, Gestorben am 10. Dezember 1813. |
G;|Jelena Wjatscheslawowna Dementjewa (russisch Елена Вячеславовна Дементьева, wiss. Transliteration Elena Vjačeslavovna Dement'eva; * 15. Oktober 1981 in Moskau) ist eine ehemalige russische Tennisspielerin.   Dementjewa begann mit dem Tennissport, als sie sieben Jahre alt war. Sie spielte und trainierte mit ihrer Kollegin Anastassija Myskina teilweise sieben Stunden pro Tag. 1998 begann sie ihre Profikarriere, ein Jahr später erreichte sie bereits die Top 100. 2000 erreichte sie als erste russische Tennisspielerin das Halbfinale bei den US Open, das sie gegen Lindsay Davenport verlor. Im selben Jahr gewann sie die Silbermedaille bei den Olympischen Spielen in Sydney (Finalniederlage gegen Venus Williams). Ihren ersten WTA-Titel gewann sie 2003 in Amelia Island. 2004 stand sie zweimal im Finale eines Grand-Slam-Turniers. Bei den French Open verlor sie gegen Anastassija Myskina, bei den US Open unterlag sie Swetlana Kusnezowa. Am Saisonende 2005 rangierte Dementjewa auf Platz 8 der WTA-Weltrangliste. Zu allen Turnieren reiste sie mit ihrer Mutter Wera, die sie auch coachte und ihr (aus Aberglauben) vor jedem Spiel „Viel Glück!“ wünschen musste. Als Allrounderin fühlte sie sich auf jedem Belag wohl. Sie gehörte zu den schnellsten Tennisspielerinnen auf der Tour. Zu ihren größten Schwächen zählte der Aufschlag. Bemerkenswert war auch, dass sie in vielen Partien nach klarer Führung oft noch über drei Sätze gehen musste. Des Weiteren bezog sie viele Niederlagen gegen Spielerinnen, die nicht zu den Top 100 zählten. Nachdem sie 2004 das Finale der French Open erreicht hatte, schied sie z. B. in Wimbledon in der ersten Runde gegen Sandra Kleinová aus. Dazu kam 2004 eine weitere bittere Niederlage gegen Alicia Molik bei den Olympischen Spielen in Athen. 2006 Zum Saisonauftakt schied Dementjewa bei den Australian Open bereits in Runde eins mit 5:7 und 3:6 gegen die Deutsche Julia Schruff aus. Sie gewann jedoch das nachfolgende Turnier in Tokio mit einem 6:2-, 6:0-Endspielsieg über Martina Hingis. Diese sagte nach dem Match über Jelena: „Wenn sie jedes Mal so spielen würde, müsste sie bald Grand-Slam-Turniere gewinnen.“ Beim Turnier von Indian Wells kam sie nach Siegen u. a. über Ana Ivanović, Li Na und Justine Henin ins Finale, das sie jedoch gegen ihre Landsfrau Marija Scharapowa mit 1:6 und 2:6 verlor. Bei den French Open unterlag sie in Runde drei Shahar Peer mit 4:6, 5:7. Sie erreichte das Halbfinale von ’s-Hertogenbosch, das sie nach einem vergebenen Matchball gegen Michaëlla Krajicek verlor. In Wimbledon kam sie bis ins Viertelfinale, unterlag dort aber erneut Scharapowa mit 1:6, 4:6. Dementjewa gehörte zu den Spielerinnen, die sich über das laute Stöhnen von Scharapowa beschwerten. Trotz ihrer Niederlage bekam sie zum ersten Mal Lob für ihren Aufschlag, den sie nun als Slice spielte und so Geschwindigkeiten von bis zu 180 km/h erreichte. Allerdings hatte sie immer noch Probleme mit dem zweiten Aufschlag, der entweder zu langsam war oder zu einem Doppelfehler führte. Beim Fed-Cup-Spiel gegen Kroatien gewann sie ihre beiden Einzel. Im August besiegte sie in Los Angeles zunächst Scharapowa und im Finale Jelena Janković mit 6:3, 4:6 und 6:4. Bei den US Open stand sie zum vierten Mal im Viertelfinale, in dem sie diesmal Janković unterlag (2:6, 1:6). In Stuttgart musste sie nach einer umkämpften Partie gegen Katarina Srebotnik im folgenden Match wegen Verletzung aufgeben. In Moskau besiegte sie u. a. Shahar Peer und Patty Schnyder und unterlag dann im Halbfinale Anna Tschakwetadse. 2006 war Dementjewa die einzige der acht Spielerinnen bei den WTA Tour Championships, die beim bedeutenden Saisonabschlussturnier seit dem Jahr 2000 durchgehend dabei war. Nach Niederlagen gegen Scharapowa und Kusnezowa sowie gegen Kim Clijsters schied sie jedoch bereits in der Vorrunde aus. 2007 Das Jahr begann mit einer Achtelfinalteilnahme bei den Australian Open, wobei sie gegen Nicole Vaidišová mit 3:6, 3:6 verlor. Beim Turnier von WTA Antwerpen verletzte sie sich im Training vor dem Match gegen ihre Landsfrau Jelena Lichowzewa und musste bis Ende Februar pausieren. Durch die Pause von sechs Wochen fiel sie erstmals seit September 2003 wieder aus den Top Ten. Am 1. Mai kehrte sie beim Turnier von Warschau wieder zurück, doch es fehlte ihr an Spielpraxis. Sie gewann mit Mühe 6:7, 6:0 und 7:5 gegen Meilen Tu aus den USA und musste sich in der zweiten Runde Venus Williams mit 1:6 und 6:7 geschlagen geben. Bei den German Open in Berlin setzte sie sich in Runde eins gegen Mara Santangelo und in Runde zwei gegen Meghann Shaughnessy jeweils in drei Sätzen durch. Im Achtelfinale unterlag sie ihrer Landsfrau Nadja Petrowa mit 3:6 und 3:6. Beim Tier-I-Turnier von Rom rückte Dementjewa nach Siegen über Maria Elena Camerin, Catalina Castaño und Nadja Petrowa bis ins Viertelfinale vor, das sie gegen Jelena Janković allerdings mit 2:6 und 1:6 verlor, auch wenn dabei viele Spiele umkämpft waren. In Istanbul, dem letzten Turnier vor den French Open, gewann sie das Finale gegen eine starke Aravane Rezaï, die beim Stand von 6:7, 0:3 verletzt aufgeben musste. Dementjewa sicherte sich damit ihren siebten Einzeltitel auf der Tour, den ersten in diesem Jahr. In Roland Garros erreichte sie allerdings nur die dritte Runde. Nach Siegen über Angelique Kerber und Mathilde Johansson verlor sie in einem schwachen Match, in dem sie beinahe 50 "vermeidbare Fehler" machte, mit 2:6 und 4:6 gegen Marion Bartoli. In Eastbourne, dem Vorbereitungsturnier für Wimbledon, kam sie bis ins Viertelfinale, in dem sie erneut gegen Bartoli verlor. Bei der 1:6-, 0:6 -Niederlage hatte Dementjewa wieder Probleme mit ihrem Aufschlag. In Wimbledon unterlag sie in der dritten Runde Tamira Paszek mit 6:3, 2:6 und 3:6. Beim Tier-I-Turnier von San Diego besiegte sie Castano, Kerber, Bartoli und ihre Landsfrau Marija Kirilenko und verlor erst im Halbfinale mit 6:74 und 0:6 gegen Patty Schnyder. In Los Angeles besiegte Dementjewa als Titelverteidigerin Makarowa, die US-Amerikanerin Brengle und eine starke Daniela Hantuchová, ehe sie im Viertelfinale mit 3:6, 4:6 an Scharapowa scheiterte. In Toronto verlor sie nach einem Freilos in Runde eins mit 7:6, 3:6 und 2:6 überraschend gegen Francesca Schiavone. Nach Siegen über Stéphanie Cohen-Aloro und Petra Cetkovská rückte sie bei den US Open bis in Runde drei vor, in der sie Sybille Bammer mit 1:6, 2:6 unterlag. Die diesjährige Teilnahme an den WTA Tour Championships war damit in weite Ferne gerückt. Nachdem sie in Peking im Viertelfinale gegen die zurückgekehrte Lindsay Davenport verloren hatte, schaffte sie auch in Stuttgart den Einzug ins Viertelfinale. Nach Siegen über Amélie Mauresmo und Daniela Hantuchová verlor sie nach hartem Kampf mit 4:6 und 4:6 gegen die Weltranglistenerste Justine Henin. Etwas überraschend gewann sie daraufhin ihr Heimatturnier in Moskau; nach Siegen über Wiktoryja Asaranka und Dinara Safina konnte sie im Finale erstmals Serena Williams schlagen. Durch ihren 5:7-, 6:1-, 6:1-Erfolg rückte Dementjewa wieder in die Top Ten vor, verpasste aber schlussendlich die Teilnahme an den WTA Tour Championships in Madrid. 2008 Bei den Australien Open kam sie wieder nur bis ins Achtelfinale, sie verlor dort gegen die spätere Siegerin Scharapowa mit 2:6, 0:6. Beim Turnier von Paris verlor sie im Halbfinale nach Matchbällen gegen die junge Ungarin Ágnes Szávay mit 3:6, 6:1 und 5:7. Anfang März gewann sie ihren neunten Einzeltitel auf der Tour. In Dubai besiegte sie Patty Schnyder, Aljona Bondarenko, Ana Ivanović, Francesca Schiavone (die zuvor Justine Henin besiegt hatte) und im Finale Swetlana Kusnezowa mit 4:6, 6:3 und 6:2. Den Erfolg hatte sie sich hart erkämpft, denn die Partien gegen Ivanović und Schiavone dauerten jeweils knapp drei Stunden. Bei den Sony Ericsson Open in Miami musste sie ihr Viertelfinalmatch gegen Janković aufgrund einer Schulterverletzung aufgeben. Trotzdem rückte sie in der Weltrangliste wieder auf Rang acht vor. Bei den French Open schied Dementjewa im Viertelfinale gegen Dinara Safina aus. In Wimbledon erreichte sie nach Siegen unter anderem über Nadja Petrowa zum ersten Mal das Halbfinale, das sie gegen Venus Willams verlor. Bei den Olympischen Spielen in Peking besiegte sie unter anderem Serena Williams. Im rein russischen Finale bezwang sie Dinara Safina mit 3:6, 7:5 und 6:3 und gewann nach der silbernen von Sydney im Jahr 2000 nun die Goldmedaille. Bei den US Open kam sie nach Siegen über Li Na im Achtel- und Patty Schnyder im Viertelfinale ins Halbfinale, das sie mit 4:6, 4:6 gegen Jelena Janković verlor. In der Weltrangliste erreichte sie mit Rang 4 wieder ihre beste Platzierung, die sie bereits im Oktober 2004 eingenommen hatte. Nachdem sie in Tokio und Stuttgart jeweils das Viertelfinale erreicht hatte, ging sie beim Kremlin Cup in Moskau als Titelverteidigerin an den Start. Dieses Mal war allerdings im Halbfinale Schluss, sie unterlag der Weltranglistenersten Jelena Janković mit 6:0, 1:6 und 0:6. Zwei Wochen danach besiegte sie im Finale von Luxemburg Caroline Wozniacki und gewann ihren elften Titel. Bereits im September hatte sie die Qualifikation für die WTA Tour Championships in Doha geschafft. In ihrer Gruppe besiegte sie dort ihre Landsfrauen Safina und (die für Serena Williams nachgerückte) und Petrowa und verlor gegen Venus Williams. Damit erreichte sie zum ersten Mal seit 2000 wieder das Halbfinale, das sie mit 6:7, 6:3 und 3:6 gegen Wera Swonarjowa verlor. Das Jahr 2008 schloss sie auf Position 4 ab. 2009 Zu Beginn des Jahres konnte Dementjewa gleich zwei Turniersiege verbuchen. Zunächst besiegte sie beim WTA-Turnier in Auckland ihre Landsfrau Jelena Wesnina mit 6:4 und 6:1. Eine Woche später schlug sie im Halbfinale von Sydney Serena Williams klar in zwei Sätzen und im Finale Dinara Safina mit 6:3, 2:6 und 6:1. Bei den Australian Open erreichte sie nach vier Achtelfinalteilnahmen erstmals das Halbfinale, das sie mit 3:6 und 4:6 gegen die spätere Siegerin Serena Williams verlor. Beim Hallenturnier von Paris unterlag sie im Finale Amélie Mauresmo in drei Sätzen. In Dubai verlor sie als Titelverteidigerin im Viertelfinale mit 3:6 und 3:6 gegen Venus Williams. Nach dem frühen Aus in Indian Wells gelang ihr in Miami der Sprung ins Achtelfinale, das sie gegen die Wozniacki verlor. In der nach dem Turnier veröffentlichten Weltrangliste stand sie zum ersten Mal in ihrer Karriere auf Platz 3. Sie war erst die sechste Russin, der dies gelungen war. Im Halbfinale von Charleston verlor sie erneut gegen Wozniacki, wenn auch knapp in drei Sätzen. Beim Turnier von Stuttgart erreichte sie ebenfalls das Halbfinale. In Madrid war gegen Mauresmo im Achtelfinale Schluss. Bei den French Open verlor sie bereits in der dritten Runde mit 3:6, 6:4 und 1:6 gegen Samantha Stosur. In Wimbledon erreichte sie wie im Vorjahr das Halbfinale, das sie nach hartem Kampf und einem vergebenen Matchball gegen die spätere Siegerin Serena Williams mit 7:6, 5:7 und 6:8 verlor. Den Rogers Cup in Toronto, eines der Vorbereitungsturniere für die US Open, beendete sie mit einem 6:4-, 6:3-Finalsieg über Scharapowa. Bei den US Open unterlag sie dann in der zweiten Runde in drei Sätzen der US-Amerikanerin Melanie Oudin. Laut WTA hatte sie sich Mitte September erneut für die WTA Tour Championships qualifiziert. In Tokio, wo Dementjewa bereits 2006 gewonnen hatte, verlor sie in der zweiten Runde gegen Kateryna Bondarenko. In Peking verlor sie im Viertelfinale mit 5:7 und 3:6 gegen die spätere Finalistin Agnieszka Radwańska. Bei den abschließenden WTA Tour Championships in Doha schied sie bereits nach der Vorrunde aus. Sie verlor ihre Gruppenspiele gegen Serena Williams (2:6, 4:6) und Swetlana Kusnezowa (3:6, 2:6). Der Sieg gegen Venus Williams mit 3:6, 7:6 und 6:2 hatte nur noch statistischen Wert. Dementjewa schloss das Jahr auf Weltranglistenposition 5 ab. 2010: Karriereende Zu Beginn des Jahres konnte sie ihren Titel beim Turnier von Sydney mit Siegen u.a. über Safina und Asaranka verteidigen. Im Finale bezwang sie Serena Williams mit 6:3 und 6:2. Bei den Australian Open verlor sie bereits in der zweiten Runde in einem engen Match gegen die zurückgekehrte Justine Henin mit 5:7 und 6:7. Beim Hallenturnier von Paris gewann Dementjewa ihren 16. Einzeltitel. Im Finale besiegte sie Lucie Šafářová mit 6:7, 6:1 und 6:4. Beim Turnier von Dubai musste sie in Runde zwei aufgrund einer Schulterverletzung beim Stande von 4:6, 1:1 gegen Daniela Hantuchova aufgeben. Das nächste Turnier bestritt sie bei den Malaysian Open in Kuala Lumpur, wo sie an Nr. 1 gesetzt im Finale mit 3:6 und 2:6 ihrer Landsfrau Alissa Kleibanowa unterlag. In Indian Wells war nach einer Niederlage gegen Agnieszka Radwanska im Viertelfinale Endstation. Nach einem Freilos verlor sie in Miami bereits in Runde zwei mit 3:6 und 2:6 gegen Justine Henin. Die folgenden Sandplatzturniere auf dem Weg nach Roland Garros verliefen ebenso unbefriedigend. In Rom verlor sie im Achtelfinale gegen Ana Ivanović mit 1:6 und 6:7, in Madrid schied sie in der zweiten Runde gegen Alexandra Dulgheru mit 1:6, 6:3 und 5:7 aus. Auch die French Open endeten mit einer Enttäuschung. Bereits bei ihrem Viertelfinalsieg über Petrowa musste sie kurze Zeit behandelt werden; das Halbfinale gegen die spätere Siegerin Francesca Schiavone musste sie wegen Oberschenkelproblemen nach dem ersten Satz aufgeben. Wegen einer Wadenverletzung legte Dementjewa acht Wochen Pause ein. Bei ihrem ersten Auftritt danach unterlag sie im Viertelfinale von Stanford Scharapowa in drei Sätzen. Die folgenden Hartplatzturniere verliefen wenig zufriedenstellend. In Cincinnati verlor sie in der zweiten Runde gegen ihre Landsfrau Anastassija Pawljutschenkowa und in Montreal schied sie im Achtelfinale gegen Zheng Jie aus. Beim Turnier von New Haven erreichte sie allerdings das Halbfinale, das sie gegen Caroline Wozniacki mit 6:1, 3:6 und 6:7 verlor. Die US Open endeten für Dementjewa im Achtelfinale gegen Samantha Stosur. Bei dem über drei Stunden dauernden Match behielt die Australierin mit 6:3, 2:6 und 7:6 die Oberhand. Beim Turnier von Tokio, das sie 2006 hatte gewinnen können, stieß sie bis ins Finale vor und musste sich dort einmal mehr Wozniacki mit 6:1, 2:6 und 3:6 geschlagen geben. In Peking, dem Ort ihres Olympiatriumphes 2008, verlor sie im Achtelfinale gegen Ivanović in zwei Tiebreaks. Noch während des Turniers wurde bekannt, dass sich Dementjewa bereits zum zehnten Mal für die WTA Tour Championships qualifiziert hatte. Dort verlor sie ihr Gruppenspiel gegen Wozniacki mit 1:6 und 1:6. Ihr zweites Match gegen Samantha Stosur (4:6, 6:4, 7:6) sollte ihr letzter Sieg sein. Nach dem letzten Vorrundenspiel gegen Francesca Schiavone, das sie mit 4:6 und 2:6 verlor, gab Dementjewa am 29. Oktober 2010 ihren Abschied vom Profitennis bekannt. Ein Sieg bei einem Grand-Slam-Turnier war ihr verwehrt geblieben. |
G;|Dmitri Iwanowitsch Mendelejew (russisch Дмитрий Иванович Менделеев, – Originalschreibweise: Дмитрій Ивановичъ Менделѣевъ – Aussprache?/i, wiss. Transliteration Dmitrij Ivanovič Mendeleev; * 27. Januarjul./ 8. Februar 1834greg. in Tobolsk, Russisches Kaiserreich; † 20. Januarjul./ 2. Februar 1907greg. in Sankt Petersburg) war ein russischer Chemiker. Er erarbeitete, unabhängig von Lothar Meyer, eine Systematik der chemischen Elemente, die er periodische Gesetzmäßigkeit nannte. Sie ermöglichte eine tabellarische Anordnung, heute Periodensystem oder Periodisches System der Elemente (PSE) genannt, sowie die Vorhersage von drei neuen Elementen. Damit vollendete Mendelejew vorläufig die 50-jährige Suche nach einem Zusammenhang zwischen den Atommassen und den chemischen Eigenschaften der chemischen Elemente. Zu seinen Ehren bekam das Element 101 den Namen Mendelevium.  Kindheit und Jugend Dmitri Mendelejew kam am 8. Februar 1834 als das jüngste der insgesamt 14 Kinder (wobei die Angabe der Anzahl in der Literatur bis zu 17 schwankt) des Gymnasialdirektors Iwan Pawlowitsch Mendelejew und von Maria Dmitrijewna Mendelejewa (geb. Korniljewa) auf die Welt. Das Elternhaus war ein geistiges Zentrum der Stadt, in der sich auch nach Sibirien verbannte Intellektuelle trafen. Sein Vater war aufgrund von Erblindung gezwungen frühzeitig den Beruf aufzugeben und starb früh, was die Familie in finanzielle Bedrängnis brachte. Die Mutter, die aus dem angesehenen sibirischen Kaufmannsdynastie Korniljew stammte, übernahm eine Glasfabrik ihrer Familie und gründete für die Arbeiter eine Dorfschule und Kirche. Mendelejew, der als Kind frühbegabt war, besuchte 1841 bis 1849 das Gymnasium in Tobolsk, wo seine Noten dürftig waren, insbesondere hatte er kein Interesse an Fremdsprachen und Latein. Mendelejew, der zur Abiturfeier seine Lateinbücher mit Klassenkameraden verbrannte, behielt bis zu seinem Lebensende einen Groll gegen die Schulbedingungen in Russland und war später aktiv an Reformbemühungen beteiligt. 1849 verkaufte die Mutter ihren Besitz und zog als 57-Jährige mit den Kindern über Moskau nach St. Petersburg, um insbesondere die Ausbildung ihres jüngsten Sohnes sicherzustellen. Versuche an der Universität in Moskau oder Sankt Petersburg angenommen zu werden scheiterten aus formalen Gründen, da dort Studenten aus Sibirien nicht angenommen wurden. Ein Medizinstudium erledigte sich, nachdem Mendelejew bei einer Obduktion in Ohnmacht fiel, es konnte aber mit einer Ausnahmegenehmigung die Aufnahme in das Pädagogische Institut in Sankt Petersburg erreicht werden. Mendelejew bestand die strenge Aufnahmeprüfung gut und wurde 1850 mit staatlichem Stipendium in das Internat des Instituts aufgenommen. Seine Mutter starb im selben Jahr. Zu seinen Lehrern am Pädagogischen Institut gehörten der Chemiker und Schüler von Justus von Liebig Alexander Abramowitsch Woskressenski (1809-1880), der Physiker Emil Lenz und der Mathematiker Michail Wassiljewitsch Ostrogradski und seine Noten besserten sich trotz häufiger Erkrankungen (er hatte offene Tuberkulose), die ihn zeitweise ins Lazarett zwangen. Er wandte sich Chemie und Mineralogie zu, tätigte erste Veröffentlichungen und erhielt nach dem Abschluss 1855 eine Medaille des Instituts. Er erhielt den Kandidaten-Abschluss (mit einer Arbeit über Isomorphismus in Verbindung zu anderen Beziehungen der Kristallform zur Zusammensetzung, 1855), konnte aber trotz der Empfehlung seiner Lehrer wegen seiner Krankheit nicht das Magister-Examen anstreben. Man gab ihm weniger als ein Jahr zu Leben, und schickte ihn, da er sein staatliches Stipendium abarbeiten musste, als Oberlehrer auf die Krim nach Simferopol, wo allerdings die Schule wegen des Krimkriegs geschlossen war, und später nach Odessa. Das milde Klima besserte gleichzeitig seine Gesundheit. 1856 kehrte er nach Sankt Petersburg zurück, legte an der Universität das Magisterexamen ab (mit der Magister-Arbeit über Spezifische Volumina) und wurde 1857 Privatdozent für Chemie an der Universität. 1860/61 war er mit einem Auslandsstipendium bei Robert Bunsen und Gustav Kirchhoff in Heidelberg (nachdem er zunächst zu Henri Victor Regnault nach Paris sollte), wobei er auch den Internationalen Chemikerkongress in Karlsruhe 1860 besuchte, auf dem Stanislao Cannizzaro seine Ideen zu Atomgewichten bekannt machte und den auch Lothar von Meyer besuchte. Der Kongress war sowohl für Meyer als auch für Mendelejew ein entscheidender Wendepunkt. Er befasste sich mit der Bestimmung von Atomgewichten und wurde in die Spektroskopie eingeführt. Seine Kontakte zu Bunsen blieben aber gering und er forschte stattdessen in einem von ihm selbst eingerichteten Labor. Nach eigenen Aussagen konnte er seine empfindlichen Experimente nicht in dem mit anderen geteilten Labor von Bunsen ausführen und er störte sich auch an den giftigen Dämpfen. Die Reise benutzte er auch um touristisch Italien und die Schweiz zu besuchen und in Paris Instrumente zu kaufen. Wieder in Sankt Petersburg war seine Dozentenstelle besetzt, er hielt aber ab Herbst 1861 ein Kolleg über organische Chemie an der Universität. Er bereitete Publikationen vor, unter anderem sein Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie, und lehrte an Schulen. Professur und Arbeit am Periodensystem Mendelejew wurde noch vor der Promotion 1864 Professor am Technologischen Institut Sankt Petersburg und wurde außerdem als Dozent an der Universität bestätigt. Er blieb bis 1866 Professor am Technologischen Institut und war dort bis 1872 Dozent für organische Chemie (bis Friedrich Beilstein deren Lehre übernahm, der seit 1866 Professor für anorganische Chemie am Technologischen Institut war). 1865 verteidigte er seine Doktorarbeit, die er zum Thema Über die Verbindung von Alkohol mit Wasser verfasste. Dass er damit wichtige Beiträge zur Wodkaherstellung lieferte und insbesondere dem bis heute üblichen Mischungsverhältnis 40:60 Teilen ist ein Mythos, er veröffentlichte auch nie über Wodkaherstellung. 1865 wurde er außerordentlicher und bald darauf ordentlicher Professor für technische Chemie an der Universität Sankt Petersburg und 1867 Professor für reine Chemie. Gleichzeitig bereitete er sein Lehrbuch der Chemie vor, was ihn auch zur Beschäftigung mit der Ordnung der Elemente anregte. Das dazu 1864 veröffentlichte Buch von Lothar Meyer kannte er nicht. Er war aber von der Typentheorie von Charles Frédéric Gerhardt beeinflusst. Ab 1868 erschien sein in Russland sehr einflussreiches Lehrbuch Grundlagen der Chemie, das viele Auflagen erlebte. Es war von Mendelejew konzipiert und geschrieben worden, da er selbst keine geeigneten russischen Lehrbücher für seinen Unterricht vorfand. Am 6. März 1869 präsentierte er, vorgetragen von Nikolai Alexandrowitsch Menschutkin, das Periodensystem der Elemente (PSE) der Russischen Chemischen Gesellschaft unter dem Titel Die Abhängigkeit der chemischen Eigenschaften der Elemente vom Atomgewicht, was unmittelbar danach in Russisch und Deutsch publiziert wurde. Dabei wurden die damals bekannten 63 Elemente ansteigend nach der Atommasse in sieben Gruppen mit ähnlichen Eigenschaften angeordnet. Lothar Meyer veröffentlichte wenige Monate später eine fast identische Tabelle. Mendelejew konnte mit seinem System 1871 die Eigenschaften der bis dahin noch unbekannten Elemente Gallium (bei Mendelejew: Eka-Aluminium), Scandium (Mendelejew: Eka-Bor) und Germanium (Mendelejew: Eka-Silizium) voraussagen. Nur wenige Jahre später wurden seine Thesen als richtig bestätigt. Die erwähnte ausführliche Veröffentlichung Mendelejews von 1871 brachte ihm besonders im Ausland den Durchbruch. In Russland stieß er anfangs auf wenig Verständnis und der Präsident der Russischen Chemischen Gesellschaft Nikolai Nikolajewitsch Sinin empfahl Mendelejew im Herbst 1869 sich wirklicher Forschung zuzuwenden, womit er Experimente in organischer Chemie meinte. Bald darauf änderte er mit weiteren Veröffentlichungen von Mendelejew, in denen er auch neue Elemente vorhersagte, seine Meinung und gratulierte ihm im Februar 1871 brieflich. Später kam es zu einem Prioritätsstreit zwischen Meyer und Mendelejew und beide veröffentlichten 1880 über die Geschichte des Periodensystems in den Berichten der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft. Lothar Meyer war durch Mendelejews Veröffentlichung von 1869 zur Veröffentlichung seiner eigenen Untersuchungen gedrängt worden (1870). Mendelejew legte sein Periodensystem auch in den späteren Auflagen seines Lehrbuchs Grundlagen der Chemie dar. Einige deutschstämmige Chemiker in Russland wie Mendelejews Kollege Victor von Richter trugen zur Verbreitung von Mendelejews Periodensystem auch nach Deutschland bei - Viktor von Meyer verwendete es 1874 in dem von ihm verfassten ersten russischen Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie. Den Entdeckungsweg schilderte Mendelejew selbst als langwieriges Puzzelspiel mit Kärtchen, auf denen er das Atomgewicht und die Eigenschaften der Elemente notiert hatte, wobei ihm der zündende Einfall im Schlaf kam. Die russische Historiographie der Entdeckung des Periodensystems durch Mendelejew war lange durch B. M. Kedrov (1903-1985) geprägt, der ab den 1940er Jahren die umfangreichen Archivmaterialien analysierte und 1958 sein Buch Der Tag der großen Entdeckung (Russisch) veröffentlichte. Nach Kedrov war das Periodensystem das Ergebnis eines plötzlichen Einfalls (am 17. Februar 1869). Später wurde das von anderen Historikern modifiziert, die den Gang der Entwicklung schon in früheren Arbeiten von Mendelejew vorbereitet sahen (R. B. Dobrotin, A. A. Makarenya, D. N. Trifonov, I. S. Dmitriev, M. D. Gordin, Masanori Kaji). Mendelejew befasste sich einige Zeit mit dem Versuch der Entdeckung neuer von seiner Theorie vorhergesagter Elemente, wozu er auch Mineralien sammelte, wandte sich aber 1872 einem neuen Forschungsgebiet zu, dem er sich über ein Jahrzehnt intensiv widmete, den physikalischen Eigenschaften von Gasen. Auf Bitten von Kollegen unterrichtete er auch nach seiner Pensionierung 1885 weiter an der Universität und gab das erst 1890 auf, als die bürokratische Reaktion auf Studentenunruhen ihn dazu bewegten. Wirtschaftliches und politisches Engagement Mendelejew war zugleich der Vater der russischen Ölindustrie. Bereits in den 1860er Jahren besuchte er die Ölfelder bei Baku in Aserbaidschan. 1876 reiste er im Auftrag der russischen Regierung in die USA, um die Ölförderung in Pennsylvania zu studieren und Empfehlungen für die Ausbeutung der russischen Reserven zu geben. Nach seiner Rückkehr erfand er neue Methoden zur Raffinierung des Öls. Seine Empfehlungen fasste er in dem Werk Die Erdölindustrie in Pennsylvania und im Kaukasus zusammen. Mendelejew befasste sich auch mit Verbesserung des Bergbaus (Kohle im Donezbecken, Eisenerz im Ural). Er vertrat die These des nicht-biologischen Ursprungs von Erdöl. Seine Arbeiten zum Erdöl brachten ihn auch mit den Nobel-Brüdern in Kontakt. Mendelejew war ein Liberaler. In seinen Vorlesungen waren anders als bei seinen Kollegen auch seit den 1860er Jahren Frauen zugelassen. Er setzte sich für Frauenbildung ein und förderte die erste Doktorandin in Chemie Julija Wsewolodowna Lermontowa. Regelmäßig machte er Eingaben an die Regierung, dabei wandte er sich gegen die zaristische Bürokratie und politische Repressionen. Seine Informationen beschaffte er sich bei Bahnreisen durch Russland, auf denen er stets dritter Klasse reiste. 1890 trat er aus Protest gegen die Einschränkung der universitären Autonomie als Professor zurück. 1893 wurde er auf Betreiben des Finanzministers Direktor des Russischen Amts für Maße und Gewichte und führte daraufhin das metrische System in Russland ein. Außerdem beriet er das Kriegs- und Marineministerium insbesondere in Hinblick auf rauchloses Schießpulver (ein von ihm erfundenes Pyrocollodium). Er unternahm landwirtschaftliche Experimente auf seinem Gut und machte dort auch durch Ballonfahrten auf sich aufmerksam. Er befasste sich mit Ökonomie, Schutzzöllen und Freihandel, wobei er besonders von Ideen von Friedrich List und Johann Heinrich von Thünen und wirkte am russischen Zolltarif von 1891 mit. Weitere Arbeiten in der Chemie Mendelejew befasste sich früh mit physikalischer Chemie und versuchte mechanische Eigenschaften wie Kohäsion und Kapillarität durch intermolekulare Kräfte zu verstehen. Er untersuchte die Zustandsgleichung von Gasen und thermische Ausdehnung von Flüssigkeiten. Das führte ihn auch zu Überlegungen zum kritischen Punkt, unabhängig von Thomas Andrews. Er vertrat eine Hydrattheorie der Lösung als chemischer Verbindung (die bei tiefen Temperaturen ausfallen sollte) mit Teil-Dissoziation, im Gegensatz zu den Vertretern der Ionentheorie wie Wilhelm Ostwald, die er nie akzeptierte. Er vertrat anfangs in der organischen Chemie die Typentheorie (siehe Substitutionsreaktion) von Gerhardt und war ein Gegner der Strukturtheorie von Alexander Michailowitsch Butlerow, der er erst ab etwa 1895 anhing. Paul Walden, der ihn persönlich aus Sankt Petersburg kannte, charakterisierte ihn dahingehend, dass er sich in allem als ein betonter Kernrusse gerierte, der mit einem Vollbart und langem Haupthaar bei einer gedrungenen Gestalt und stoßweisen Sprechart eher einem Popen entspräche. Nach Walden war er leidenschaftlich in seiner Kritik und brüsk gegenüber jüngeren Kollegen, denen er empfahl bevor sie nach eigenen Entdeckungen strebten erst die Klassiker wie Berzelius, Gmelin und andere zu studieren. Außerdem stand er nach Walden dem aus Deutschland kommenden chemischen Gedankengut ablehnend gegenüber (obwohl er bei Bunsen studiert hatte) und ebenfalls der zeitgenössischen neueren organischen Chemie und physikalischen Chemie (Wilhelm Ostwald, Svante Arrhenius, Jacobus Henricus van ’t Hoff), die die eigene Theorie der Lösungen von Mendelejew (1887) noch zu Lebzeiten widerlegten. Er hatte nach Walden zwar tausende Schüler, gründete aber keine eigentliche Schule. Auszeichnungen und Privates Trotz seines Ansehens wurde Mendelejew nie Mitglied der Russischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, der Versuch der Aufnahme 1880 scheiterte. Die Gründe waren teilweise politischer Natur. Mendelejew war Ehrenmitglied der Moskauer Universität, Mitglied der Russischen Akademie der Künste sowie Mitglied von 90 ausländischen Akademien der Wissenschaften, darunter auch der Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin. 1892 wurde er Mitglied der Royal Society und erhielt 1882 die Davy Medal und 1905 die Copley-Medaille. 1862 erhielt Mendelejew den Demidow-Preis für sein Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie. Die höchste Auszeichnung für Wissenschaftler, der Nobelpreis, blieb ihm 1906 knapp verwehrt. Eine Stimme fehlte ihm im maßgeblichen Komitee für diese Ehrung. Ferner wurde er 1889 in die American Academy of Arts and Sciences aufgenommen. Er war zweimal verheiratet und hatte mehrere Kinder. In erster Heirat war er 1862 mit Theosebia Nikitichna Leshcheva aus Tobolsk verheiratet, von der er sich 1882 scheiden liess, um im selben Jahr Anna Iwanowna Popova (1860-1942) zu ehelichen, in die er sich 1876 leidenschaftlich verliebt hatte. Aus erster Ehe hatte er zwei Kinder Wladimir und Olga, aus zweiter Ehe vier, die Zwillinge Maria und Wassili sowie die Tochter Ljubow, die Alexander Blok heiratete, und Iwan. Dass er zwischen seiner Scheidung und neuen Heirat nicht wie vom Zaren gefordert sieben Jahre vergehen liess schadete seinem Ruf. Mendelejew starb im Januar 1907 an den Folgen einer Grippe. An seiner Beerdigung auf dem Petersburger Wolkowo-Friedhof, auf dem er neben seiner Mutter begraben liegt, nahmen mehrere tausend Menschen teil. Er hatte Schwierigkeiten mit Fremdsprachen (auch wenn er französisch und deutsch sprach und las), bemühte sich aber zum Beispiel um deutsch-russische Zusammenarbeit, besuchte öfter Deutschland und nahm das Angebot von Wilhelm Ostwald an, an der 1887 gegründeten Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie mitzuwirken. 1868 war er mit Menschutkin an der Gründung der russischen chemischen Gesellschaft beteiligt (die später nach ihm benannt wurde). Wissenschaftler der University of California, Berkeley, benannten 1955 das 101. chemische Element Mendelevium nach dem verstorbenen Chemiker. Mendelejew wurde während der Sowjetunion oft Namenspate; so der Russischen Chemisch-Technologischen Universität in Moskau, der tatarischen Stadt Mendelejewsk, zahlreicher weiterer Siedlungen und Dörfer sowie des Moskauer U-Bahnhofs „Mendelejewskaja“. Die Russische Akademie der Wissenschaften verleiht ihm zu Ehren die Mendelejew-Goldmedaille. Mit der Zeit wurden noch weitere Objekte Träger seines Namens, dazu gehören unter anderem ein Vulkan, ein unterseeischer Gebirgskamm, der Asteroid (2769) Mendeleev und ein Krater auf dem Mond. |
G;|Dmitri Iwanowitsch Mendelejew (russisch Дмитрий Иванович Менделеев, – Originalschreibweise: Дмитрій Ивановичъ Менделѣевъ – Aussprache?/i, wiss. Transliteration Dmitrij Ivanovič Mendeleev; * 27. Januarjul./ 8. Februar 1834greg. in Tobolsk, Russisches Kaiserreich; † 20. Januarjul./ 2. Februar 1907greg. in Sankt Petersburg) war ein russischer Chemiker. Er erarbeitete, unabhängig von Lothar Meyer, eine Systematik der chemischen Elemente, die er periodische Gesetzmäßigkeit nannte. Sie ermöglichte eine tabellarische Anordnung, heute Periodensystem oder Periodisches System der Elemente (PSE) genannt, sowie die Vorhersage von drei neuen Elementen. Damit vollendete Mendelejew vorläufig die 50-jährige Suche nach einem Zusammenhang zwischen den Atommassen und den chemischen Eigenschaften der chemischen Elemente. Zu seinen Ehren bekam das Element 101 den Namen Mendelevium.  Kindheit und Jugend Dmitri Mendelejew kam am 8. Februar 1834 als das jüngste der insgesamt 14 Kinder (wobei die Angabe der Anzahl in der Literatur bis zu 17 schwankt) des Gymnasialdirektors Iwan Pawlowitsch Mendelejew und von Maria Dmitrijewna Mendelejewa (geb. Korniljewa) auf die Welt. Das Elternhaus war ein geistiges Zentrum der Stadt, in der sich auch nach Sibirien verbannte Intellektuelle trafen. Sein Vater war aufgrund von Erblindung gezwungen frühzeitig den Beruf aufzugeben und starb früh, was die Familie in finanzielle Bedrängnis brachte. Die Mutter, die aus dem angesehenen sibirischen Kaufmannsdynastie Korniljew stammte, übernahm eine Glasfabrik ihrer Familie und gründete für die Arbeiter eine Dorfschule und Kirche. Mendelejew, der als Kind frühbegabt war, besuchte 1841 bis 1849 das Gymnasium in Tobolsk, wo seine Noten dürftig waren, insbesondere hatte er kein Interesse an Fremdsprachen und Latein. Mendelejew, der zur Abiturfeier seine Lateinbücher mit Klassenkameraden verbrannte, behielt bis zu seinem Lebensende einen Groll gegen die Schulbedingungen in Russland und war später aktiv an Reformbemühungen beteiligt. 1849 verkaufte die Mutter ihren Besitz und zog als 57-Jährige mit den Kindern über Moskau nach St. Petersburg, um insbesondere die Ausbildung ihres jüngsten Sohnes sicherzustellen. Versuche an der Universität in Moskau oder Sankt Petersburg angenommen zu werden scheiterten aus formalen Gründen, da dort Studenten aus Sibirien nicht angenommen wurden. Ein Medizinstudium erledigte sich, nachdem Mendelejew bei einer Obduktion in Ohnmacht fiel, es konnte aber mit einer Ausnahmegenehmigung die Aufnahme in das Pädagogische Institut in Sankt Petersburg erreicht werden. Mendelejew bestand die strenge Aufnahmeprüfung gut und wurde 1850 mit staatlichem Stipendium in das Internat des Instituts aufgenommen. Seine Mutter starb im selben Jahr. Zu seinen Lehrern am Pädagogischen Institut gehörten der Chemiker und Schüler von Justus von Liebig Alexander Abramowitsch Woskressenski (1809-1880), der Physiker Emil Lenz und der Mathematiker Michail Wassiljewitsch Ostrogradski und seine Noten besserten sich trotz häufiger Erkrankungen (er hatte offene Tuberkulose), die ihn zeitweise ins Lazarett zwangen. Er wandte sich Chemie und Mineralogie zu, tätigte erste Veröffentlichungen und erhielt nach dem Abschluss 1855 eine Medaille des Instituts. Er erhielt den Kandidaten-Abschluss (mit einer Arbeit über Isomorphismus in Verbindung zu anderen Beziehungen der Kristallform zur Zusammensetzung, 1855), konnte aber trotz der Empfehlung seiner Lehrer wegen seiner Krankheit nicht das Magister-Examen anstreben. Man gab ihm weniger als ein Jahr zu Leben, und schickte ihn, da er sein staatliches Stipendium abarbeiten musste, als Oberlehrer auf die Krim nach Simferopol, wo allerdings die Schule wegen des Krimkriegs geschlossen war, und später nach Odessa. Das milde Klima besserte gleichzeitig seine Gesundheit. 1856 kehrte er nach Sankt Petersburg zurück, legte an der Universität das Magisterexamen ab (mit der Magister-Arbeit über Spezifische Volumina) und wurde 1857 Privatdozent für Chemie an der Universität. 1860/61 war er mit einem Auslandsstipendium bei Robert Bunsen und Gustav Kirchhoff in Heidelberg (nachdem er zunächst zu Henri Victor Regnault nach Paris sollte), wobei er auch den Internationalen Chemikerkongress in Karlsruhe 1860 besuchte, auf dem Stanislao Cannizzaro seine Ideen zu Atomgewichten bekannt machte und den auch Lothar von Meyer besuchte. Der Kongress war sowohl für Meyer als auch für Mendelejew ein entscheidender Wendepunkt. Er befasste sich mit der Bestimmung von Atomgewichten und wurde in die Spektroskopie eingeführt. Seine Kontakte zu Bunsen blieben aber gering und er forschte stattdessen in einem von ihm selbst eingerichteten Labor. Nach eigenen Aussagen konnte er seine empfindlichen Experimente nicht in dem mit anderen geteilten Labor von Bunsen ausführen und er störte sich auch an den giftigen Dämpfen. Die Reise benutzte er auch um touristisch Italien und die Schweiz zu besuchen und in Paris Instrumente zu kaufen. Wieder in Sankt Petersburg war seine Dozentenstelle besetzt, er hielt aber ab Herbst 1861 ein Kolleg über organische Chemie an der Universität. Er bereitete Publikationen vor, unter anderem sein Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie, und lehrte an Schulen. Professur und Arbeit am Periodensystem Mendelejew wurde noch vor der Promotion 1864 Professor am Technologischen Institut Sankt Petersburg und wurde außerdem als Dozent an der Universität bestätigt. Er blieb bis 1866 Professor am Technologischen Institut und war dort bis 1872 Dozent für organische Chemie (bis Friedrich Beilstein deren Lehre übernahm, der seit 1866 Professor für anorganische Chemie am Technologischen Institut war). 1865 verteidigte er seine Doktorarbeit, die er zum Thema Über die Verbindung von Alkohol mit Wasser verfasste. Dass er damit wichtige Beiträge zur Wodkaherstellung lieferte und insbesondere dem bis heute üblichen Mischungsverhältnis 40:60 Teilen ist ein Mythos, er veröffentlichte auch nie über Wodkaherstellung. 1865 wurde er außerordentlicher und bald darauf ordentlicher Professor für technische Chemie an der Universität Sankt Petersburg und 1867 Professor für reine Chemie. Gleichzeitig bereitete er sein Lehrbuch der Chemie vor, was ihn auch zur Beschäftigung mit der Ordnung der Elemente anregte. Das dazu 1864 veröffentlichte Buch von Lothar Meyer kannte er nicht. Er war aber von der Typentheorie von Charles Frédéric Gerhardt beeinflusst. Ab 1868 erschien sein in Russland sehr einflussreiches Lehrbuch Grundlagen der Chemie, das viele Auflagen erlebte. Es war von Mendelejew konzipiert und geschrieben worden, da er selbst keine geeigneten russischen Lehrbücher für seinen Unterricht vorfand. Am 6. März 1869 präsentierte er, vorgetragen von Nikolai Alexandrowitsch Menschutkin, das Periodensystem der Elemente (PSE) der Russischen Chemischen Gesellschaft unter dem Titel Die Abhängigkeit der chemischen Eigenschaften der Elemente vom Atomgewicht, was unmittelbar danach in Russisch und Deutsch publiziert wurde. Dabei wurden die damals bekannten 63 Elemente ansteigend nach der Atommasse in sieben Gruppen mit ähnlichen Eigenschaften angeordnet. Lothar Meyer veröffentlichte wenige Monate später eine fast identische Tabelle. Mendelejew konnte mit seinem System 1871 die Eigenschaften der bis dahin noch unbekannten Elemente Gallium (bei Mendelejew: Eka-Aluminium), Scandium (Mendelejew: Eka-Bor) und Germanium (Mendelejew: Eka-Silizium) voraussagen. Nur wenige Jahre später wurden seine Thesen als richtig bestätigt. Die erwähnte ausführliche Veröffentlichung Mendelejews von 1871 brachte ihm besonders im Ausland den Durchbruch. In Russland stieß er anfangs auf wenig Verständnis und der Präsident der Russischen Chemischen Gesellschaft Nikolai Nikolajewitsch Sinin empfahl Mendelejew im Herbst 1869 sich wirklicher Forschung zuzuwenden, womit er Experimente in organischer Chemie meinte. Bald darauf änderte er mit weiteren Veröffentlichungen von Mendelejew, in denen er auch neue Elemente vorhersagte, seine Meinung und gratulierte ihm im Februar 1871 brieflich. Später kam es zu einem Prioritätsstreit zwischen Meyer und Mendelejew und beide veröffentlichten 1880 über die Geschichte des Periodensystems in den Berichten der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft. Lothar Meyer war durch Mendelejews Veröffentlichung von 1869 zur Veröffentlichung seiner eigenen Untersuchungen gedrängt worden (1870). Mendelejew legte sein Periodensystem auch in den späteren Auflagen seines Lehrbuchs Grundlagen der Chemie dar. Einige deutschstämmige Chemiker in Russland wie Mendelejews Kollege Victor von Richter trugen zur Verbreitung von Mendelejews Periodensystem auch nach Deutschland bei - Viktor von Meyer verwendete es 1874 in dem von ihm verfassten ersten russischen Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie. Den Entdeckungsweg schilderte Mendelejew selbst als langwieriges Puzzelspiel mit Kärtchen, auf denen er das Atomgewicht und die Eigenschaften der Elemente notiert hatte, wobei ihm der zündende Einfall im Schlaf kam. Die russische Historiographie der Entdeckung des Periodensystems durch Mendelejew war lange durch B. M. Kedrov (1903-1985) geprägt, der ab den 1940er Jahren die umfangreichen Archivmaterialien analysierte und 1958 sein Buch Der Tag der großen Entdeckung (Russisch) veröffentlichte. Nach Kedrov war das Periodensystem das Ergebnis eines plötzlichen Einfalls (am 17. Februar 1869). Später wurde das von anderen Historikern modifiziert, die den Gang der Entwicklung schon in früheren Arbeiten von Mendelejew vorbereitet sahen (R. B. Dobrotin, A. A. Makarenya, D. N. Trifonov, I. S. Dmitriev, M. D. Gordin, Masanori Kaji). Mendelejew befasste sich einige Zeit mit dem Versuch der Entdeckung neuer von seiner Theorie vorhergesagter Elemente, wozu er auch Mineralien sammelte, wandte sich aber 1872 einem neuen Forschungsgebiet zu, dem er sich über ein Jahrzehnt intensiv widmete, den physikalischen Eigenschaften von Gasen. Auf Bitten von Kollegen unterrichtete er auch nach seiner Pensionierung 1885 weiter an der Universität und gab das erst 1890 auf, als die bürokratische Reaktion auf Studentenunruhen ihn dazu bewegten. Wirtschaftliches und politisches Engagement Mendelejew war zugleich der Vater der russischen Ölindustrie. Bereits in den 1860er Jahren besuchte er die Ölfelder bei Baku in Aserbaidschan. 1876 reiste er im Auftrag der russischen Regierung in die USA, um die Ölförderung in Pennsylvania zu studieren und Empfehlungen für die Ausbeutung der russischen Reserven zu geben. Nach seiner Rückkehr erfand er neue Methoden zur Raffinierung des Öls. Seine Empfehlungen fasste er in dem Werk Die Erdölindustrie in Pennsylvania und im Kaukasus zusammen. Mendelejew befasste sich auch mit Verbesserung des Bergbaus (Kohle im Donezbecken, Eisenerz im Ural). Er vertrat die These des nicht-biologischen Ursprungs von Erdöl. Seine Arbeiten zum Erdöl brachten ihn auch mit den Nobel-Brüdern in Kontakt. Mendelejew war ein Liberaler. In seinen Vorlesungen waren anders als bei seinen Kollegen auch seit den 1860er Jahren Frauen zugelassen. Er setzte sich für Frauenbildung ein und förderte die erste Doktorandin in Chemie Julija Wsewolodowna Lermontowa. Regelmäßig machte er Eingaben an die Regierung, dabei wandte er sich gegen die zaristische Bürokratie und politische Repressionen. Seine Informationen beschaffte er sich bei Bahnreisen durch Russland, auf denen er stets dritter Klasse reiste. 1890 trat er aus Protest gegen die Einschränkung der universitären Autonomie als Professor zurück. 1893 wurde er auf Betreiben des Finanzministers Direktor des Russischen Amts für Maße und Gewichte und führte daraufhin das metrische System in Russland ein. Außerdem beriet er das Kriegs- und Marineministerium insbesondere in Hinblick auf rauchloses Schießpulver (ein von ihm erfundenes Pyrocollodium). Er unternahm landwirtschaftliche Experimente auf seinem Gut und machte dort auch durch Ballonfahrten auf sich aufmerksam. Er befasste sich mit Ökonomie, Schutzzöllen und Freihandel, wobei er besonders von Ideen von Friedrich List und Johann Heinrich von Thünen und wirkte am russischen Zolltarif von 1891 mit.

Er befasste sich mit Ökonomie, Schutzzöllen und Freihandel, wobei er besonders von Ideen von Friedrich List und Johann Heinrich von Thünen und wirkte am russischen Zolltarif von 1891 mit. Weitere Arbeiten in der Chemie Mendelejew befasste sich früh mit physikalischer Chemie und versuchte mechanische Eigenschaften wie Kohäsion und Kapillarität durch intermolekulare Kräfte zu verstehen. Er untersuchte die Zustandsgleichung von Gasen und thermische Ausdehnung von Flüssigkeiten. Das führte ihn auch zu Überlegungen zum kritischen Punkt, unabhängig von Thomas Andrews. Er vertrat eine Hydrattheorie der Lösung als chemischer Verbindung (die bei tiefen Temperaturen ausfallen sollte) mit Teil-Dissoziation, im Gegensatz zu den Vertretern der Ionentheorie wie Wilhelm Ostwald, die er nie akzeptierte. Er vertrat anfangs in der organischen Chemie die Typentheorie (siehe Substitutionsreaktion) von Gerhardt und war ein Gegner der Strukturtheorie von Alexander Michailowitsch Butlerow, der er erst ab etwa 1895 anhing. Paul Walden, der ihn persönlich aus Sankt Petersburg kannte, charakterisierte ihn dahingehend, dass er sich in allem als ein betonter Kernrusse gerierte, der mit einem Vollbart und langem Haupthaar bei einer gedrungenen Gestalt und stoßweisen Sprechart eher einem Popen entspräche. Nach Walden war er leidenschaftlich in seiner Kritik und brüsk gegenüber jüngeren Kollegen, denen er empfahl bevor sie nach eigenen Entdeckungen strebten erst die Klassiker wie Berzelius, Gmelin und andere zu studieren. Außerdem stand er nach Walden dem aus Deutschland kommenden chemischen Gedankengut ablehnend gegenüber (obwohl er bei Bunsen studiert hatte) und ebenfalls der zeitgenössischen neueren organischen Chemie und physikalischen Chemie (Wilhelm Ostwald, Svante Arrhenius, Jacobus Henricus van ’t Hoff), die die eigene Theorie der Lösungen von Mendelejew (1887) noch zu Lebzeiten widerlegten. Er hatte nach Walden zwar tausende Schüler, gründete aber keine eigentliche Schule. Auszeichnungen und Privates Trotz seines Ansehens wurde Mendelejew nie Mitglied der Russischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, der Versuch der Aufnahme 1880 scheiterte. Die Gründe waren teilweise politischer Natur. Mendelejew war Ehrenmitglied der Moskauer Universität, Mitglied der Russischen Akademie der Künste sowie Mitglied von 90 ausländischen Akademien der Wissenschaften, darunter auch der Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin. 1892 wurde er Mitglied der Royal Society und erhielt 1882 die Davy Medal und 1905 die Copley-Medaille. 1862 erhielt Mendelejew den Demidow-Preis für sein Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie. Die höchste Auszeichnung für Wissenschaftler, der Nobelpreis, blieb ihm 1906 knapp verwehrt. Eine Stimme fehlte ihm im maßgeblichen Komitee für diese Ehrung. Ferner wurde er 1889 in die American Academy of Arts and Sciences aufgenommen. Er war zweimal verheiratet und hatte mehrere Kinder. In erster Heirat war er 1862 mit Theosebia Nikitichna Leshcheva aus Tobolsk verheiratet, von der er sich 1882 scheiden liess, um im selben Jahr Anna Iwanowna Popova (1860-1942) zu ehelichen, in die er sich 1876 leidenschaftlich verliebt hatte. Aus erster Ehe hatte er zwei Kinder Wladimir und Olga, aus zweiter Ehe vier, die Zwillinge Maria und Wassili sowie die Tochter Ljubow, die Alexander Blok heiratete, und Iwan. Dass er zwischen seiner Scheidung und neuen Heirat nicht wie vom Zaren gefordert sieben Jahre vergehen liess schadete seinem Ruf. Mendelejew starb im Januar 1907 an den Folgen einer Grippe. An seiner Beerdigung auf dem Petersburger Wolkowo-Friedhof, auf dem er neben seiner Mutter begraben liegt, nahmen mehrere tausend Menschen teil. Er hatte Schwierigkeiten mit Fremdsprachen (auch wenn er französisch und deutsch sprach und las), bemühte sich aber zum Beispiel um deutsch-russische Zusammenarbeit, besuchte öfter Deutschland und nahm das Angebot von Wilhelm Ostwald an, an der 1887 gegründeten Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie mitzuwirken. 1868 war er mit Menschutkin an der Gründung der russischen chemischen Gesellschaft beteiligt (die später nach ihm benannt wurde). Wissenschaftler der University of California, Berkeley, benannten 1955 das 101. chemische Element Mendelevium nach dem verstorbenen Chemiker. Mendelejew wurde während der Sowjetunion oft Namenspate; so der Russischen Chemisch-Technologischen Universität in Moskau, der tatarischen Stadt Mendelejewsk, zahlreicher weiterer Siedlungen und Dörfer sowie des Moskauer U-Bahnhofs „Mendelejewskaja“. Die Russische Akademie der Wissenschaften verleiht ihm zu Ehren die Mendelejew-Goldmedaille. Mit der Zeit wurden noch weitere Objekte Träger seines Namens, dazu gehören unter anderem ein Vulkan, ein unterseeischer Gebirgskamm, der Asteroid (2769) Mendeleev und ein Krater auf dem Mond. |
G;|Victor Adler (auch Viktor Adler; * 24. Juni 1852 in Prag; † 11. November 1918 in Wien) war österreichischer Politiker und Begründer der Sozialdemokratischen Arbeiterpartei. Obwohl großbürgerlicher Herkunft und zuvor im Lager der Deutschnationalen aktiv gewesen, konnte er durch sein Charisma und die Fähigkeit, Menschen von Kompromissen zu überzeugen, die unterschiedlichen Strömungen der österreichischen Arbeiterbewegung 1889 vereinen. Durch personelle Einbindung sowohl der „Radikalen“ als auch der „Reformisten“, die sich auch in Adlers geschickten theoretischen Formulierungen in Parteiprogrammen wiederfinden konnten, gelang es ihm, zeit seines Lebens und darüber hinaus die Einheit der österreichischen Sozialdemokratie zu wahren.  Frühe Jahre Victor wurde als ältestes von fünf Kindern des jüdischen Kaufmanns Salomon Markus Adler und seiner Frau Johanna (geb. Herzl) in Prag geboren. 1855 übersiedelte die Familie, die erst 1851 aus dem mährischen Lipnik nach Prag gekommen war, nach Wien Leopoldstadt. Hier gelang es dem Vater, durch Realitätengeschäfte beträchtliches Vermögen zu erwerben. Victor war ein schmächtiges, kleines Kind, das stotterte. Er absolvierte das Schottengymnasium, eine der besten Schulen Wiens. Heinrich Friedjung war einer seiner wenigen jüdischen Mitschüler in der katholischen Schule. Adler studierte zunächst Chemie, anschließend 1872 bis 1881 Medizin an der Universität Wien und wurde auf Initiative seines ehemaligen Mitschülers Engelbert Pernerstorfer Mitglied der deutschnationalen Burschenschaft Arminia Wien (aufgrund ihrer Mützenfarbe als „braune Arminia“ bezeichnet, in Abgrenzung zur „blauen Arminia“). Er praktizierte als Assistent von Theodor Meynert an der Psychiatrischen Klinik des Allgemeinen Krankenhauses. 1878 lernte er Emma Braun (1858–1935) kennen, am 3. September 1878 heirateten die beiden, Sohn Friedrich kam 1879 zur Welt. Adler arbeitete als Armenarzt und seit 1883 auch als Nervenarzt, ehe er sich journalistisch betätigte. 1882–1889 wohnte und praktizierte er im 9. Wiener Bezirk im geerbten Haus in der Berggasse 19. (1891 ließ sich Sigmund Freud in einem an dieser Adresse neu errichteten Haus nieder.) Vom Deutschnationalismus zur Sozialdemokratie Schon seit 1870 trafen sich Victor, sein Bruder Siegmund, der später Rechtshistoriker wurde, Friedjung und Pernerstorfer zu sonntäglichen Diskussionsrunden über die soziale und nationale Frage in der Adlerschen Villa in Wien Döbling. Politisch stand Adler zunächst der deutschnationalen Bewegung um Georg von Schönerer nahe und war, wie sein Freund Friedjung, Mitautor ihres 1882 veröffentlichten Linzer Programms. Nach dem Scheitern des Programms und weil er seine sozialen Forderungen in der deutschnationalen Bewegung kaum noch berücksichtigt sah, schloss sich Victor Adler einem sozialdemokratisch geprägten Arbeiterbildungsverein an. Vor allem der rasch wachsende Antisemitismus der Deutschnationalen hatte ihn von dieser Gruppierung Abstand nehmen lassen. 1886 gründete Adler in Wien mit dem Erbe seines Vaters die Wochenzeitung „Gleichheit“, in der er in einer Reihe von aufsehenerregenden Artikeln das Elend der Wienerberger Ziegelarbeiter schilderte. Den Ziegelarbeitern brachte seine Kampagne zunächst die Abschaffung des, seit 1885 ohnehin ungesetzlichen, Trucksystems in den Lehmgruben im Süden Wiens und nach dem Ziegelarbeiterstreik des Jahres 1895 weitere soziale Reformen. Nach dem Verbot der „Gleichheit“ gründete Adler 1889 die „Arbeiter-Zeitung“ die zunächst zweimal im Monat, ab 18. Oktober 1889 wöchentlich erschien. Mit 1. Jänner 1895 brachte er das Blatt, für das er den größten Teil seines Vermögens opferte, als Tageszeitung heraus und gewann Friedrich Austerlitz zu seinem Nachfolger als Chefredakteur. Während einer Reise nach Deutschland, in die Schweiz und nach England als Vorbereitung auf eine (erfolglose) Bewerbung als Gewerbeinspektor traf er sich unter anderem mit Friedrich Engels, August Bebel und Wilhelm Liebknecht. Mit Engels und Bebel verbanden ihn lebenslange enge Freundschaften. Adlers politische Tätigkeit brachte ihm zwischen 1887 und 1900 17 Anklagen vor Gericht und insgesamt 9 Monate Arrest ein. Begründer der Sozialdemokratischen Arbeiterpartei Im k.k. Österreich führten die verspätete Modernisierung und die Konzentration der Industrie auf den deutschösterreichisch-böhmischen Raum zu einer kompakten Arbeiterbewegung mit straffer Organisationsstruktur und dem Übergewicht der zentralen Führungsfigur Victor Adler. Er überwand, obwohl er als Intellektueller und wegen seiner bürgerlichen Herkunft anfangs als Außenseiter betrachtet wurde, die Richtungskämpfe der frühen Arbeiterorganisationen. Der Durchbruch gelang Adler 1885 bei einer Versammlung gegen die von Ministerpräsident Eduard Taaffe geplanten Sozialistengesetze, an der zum ersten Mal seit langer Zeit wieder alle Richtungen der Arbeiterbewegung teilnahmen. Durch sein ausgleichendes Wirken kam es zu einer Resolution, die „Radikale“ und „Gemäßigte“ akzeptierten. Adlers Formel, der Kampf der Arbeiterklasse sei „mit allen zweckdienlichen und dem natürlichen Rechtsbewußtsein des Volkes entsprechenden Mitteln“ zu führen, überbrückte die Gegensätze erfolgreich. Auf dem Hainfelder Parteitag vom 30. Dezember 1888 bis 1. Jänner 1889 vereinigte Victor Adler die verschiedenen sozialdemokratischen Gruppen – Gewerksvereine, Gewerkschaften und Genossenschaften, die „Radikalen“ und die „Gemäßigten“ im kaiserlichen Österreich und gilt damit als Begründer der Sozialdemokratischen Arbeiterpartei, SDAP, aus der die heutige Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs, SPÖ, hervorging. Adler wurde zum ersten Vorsitzenden der neuen Partei gewählt. „Das Charisma Adlers […] festigte die Partei und hielt sie zusammen. Jedenfalls ist die Geschichte dieses Mannes die Geschichte seiner Partei, und den Mann zu verstehen, heißt: die gesellschaftlichen Kräfte begreifen, die er personifizierte“. Adler, der sich selbst als „Hofrat der Nation“ bezeichnete, verstand es meisterhaft, einen Ausgleich zwischen den Flügeln der Partei, zwischen „Theorie“ und „Praxis“, zu finden. Hermann Bahr beschrieb das Charisma Adlers: Adler gehörte zum liberalen, gemäßigten Flügel der Partei, der die Rechte der Arbeiter mit demokratischen Mitteln durchsetzen wollte. Besonders setzte er sich für die Zusammenarbeit mit der ungarischen und südslawischen Arbeiterbewegung in der Doppelmonarchie Österreich-Ungarn ein. Reformbestrebungen für Altösterreich und das allgemeine Wahlrecht 1899 war Adler maßgeblich an der Erstellung des Brünner Programms beteiligt, in welchem zur Lösung des Nationalitäten- und Sprachproblems des k.k. Österreich die Bildung eines demokratischen Nationalitätenbundesstaates gefordert wurde. (Das Programm bezog sich nicht auf Altungarn, das so genannte Transleithanien.) Seit 1901 war er, obwohl nach wie vor Vorsitzender der Partei, nur Abgeordneter im Landtag von Niederösterreich. Da er nicht in aussichtsreichen Wahlkreisen kandidierte, konnte er erst spät, 1905 durch Nachwahlen in Reichenberg, Böhmen, in den Wiener Reichsrat einziehen, wo er sich bald beträchtliches Ansehen erwarb. Adler trat nicht für Revolution und Gewalt ein, sondern war für gemäßigtes Vorgehen, um die Sache der Arbeiter nicht zu gefährden. Sein größtes politisches Anliegen, das allgemeine Wahlrecht für Männer, erreichte er nicht durch Drohungen, sondern mit Hilfe geschickter Arrangements mit den Mächtigen. So trug er 1906 als Vermittler zwischen den Parteien im Reichrat und der Regierung maßgeblich zur Verabschiedung des allgemeinen Wahlrechts für Männer unter Ministerpräsident Beck bei. Nach den ersten freien Wahlen 1907 zogen die Sozialdemokraten mit 87 Mandaten als stärkste Partei in den Reichsrat ein. Adler bemühte sich um die Einheit der Sozialdemokraten im kaiserlichen Österreich, konnte aber die Abspaltung der tschechischen Sozialisten 1911 nicht verhindern. Auf der II. Internationale, dem Basler Kongress, setzte er sich für eine einheitliche Friedenspolitik der Sozialdemokratie in Europa ein. Kritik von Otto Bauer Die Politik der österreichischen Sozialdemokratie wurde von 1889 bis in den Ersten Weltkrieg wesentlich von Victor Adler mit seiner betont reformistischen Haltung bestimmt und geprägt. Er führte den Kampf gegen die imperialistische österreichische Balkanpolitik mit einiger Zurückhaltung. Dies führte zur Kritik Otto Bauers, der in großdeutschem Wunschdenken die Verknüpfung des deutschen Volkes an den verwesenden Leichnam der Habsburgermonarchie ablehnte. Für Bauer führte Adlers Kampf um die Demokratie, zur Umgestaltung und Modernisierung der alten Monarchie, eher zu deren Sprengung. Aber auch Adler bezeichnete die innenpolitische Stagnation seit der Regierung Koerber 1900–1904 als Schrecken ohne Ende. Adlers „Burgfriedenspolitik“ bis Sommer 1916 Bei Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges war der Reichsrat vertagt (und blieb dies auch bis 1917). Adler trat dennoch für die Annahme der Kriegskredite ein, da er Österreich-Ungarn in einem Verteidigungskrieg sah. Zu Kriegsbeginn ließ Adlers antirussische Orientierung, die in einer zaristischen Fremdherrschaft das schlimmste sah, ihn an den Verteidigungscharakter des Krieges glauben. Er war bereit, die Politik im Krieg zum „Zwecke der Selbstverteidigung“ anzuhalten. Für diese Politik, von seinen Gegnern am linken Flügel der Partei als „Burgfriedenspolitik“ bezeichnet, wurde er heftig angegriffen. Es gehe um die Existenz Deutschlands, um Selbstbehauptung und Sein des deutschen Volkes, dessen Ziele, angesichts der russischen Bedrohung, mit denen des Proletariats identisch seien. Hier brach Adlers ältere deutschnationale Einstellung mit ihrer Fixierung auf Berlin und ihrer Angst vor Russland wieder durch. Er hielt die Zustimmung der deutschen Sozialdemokraten zu Kriegskrediten und Burgfrieden im deutschen Reichstag für richtig. Er sagte, die österreichische Sozialdemokratie hätte in einem arbeitsfähigen Parlament ebenso votiert. Ende März 1916 beschloss die Reichskonferenz der sozialdemokratischen Arbeiterpartei in Österreich: Die wirtschaftliche Annäherung an Deutschland wurde nur akzeptiert, wenn freier Handel gewährleistet sei, ein protektionistisches Mitteleuropa wurde als imperialistisch abgelehnt. Renners Forderung nach einer umfassenden territorialen Neuregelung, um einen dauerhaften Frieden zu erreichen, rief die offene Kritik Adlers hervor. Aber auch Adler sah sich wegen der Polenfrage gehindert, frühzeitig das populäre Schlagwort vom Frieden ohne Annexionen aufzugreifen. Bis Sommer 1916 rechnete Adler mit einem Sieg und trachtete daher, das erwartete Einlenken der Westmächte nicht durch innenpolitische Opposition zu behindern Sozialdemokratische Friedenspolitik 1916–1918 Im Herbst 1916 wandelten sich jedoch Ziele und Haltung der Sozialdemokraten entscheidend: Die Reichskonferenz der deutschen sozialdemokratischen Partei Österreichs beschloss am 5. November 1916: Am 21. Oktober 1916 erschoss einer der Söhne Victor Adlers, Friedrich, aus Protest gegen die Kriegsdiktatur in Altösterreich den k.k. Ministerpräsidenten Karl Stürgkh. Er wurde zum Tode verurteilt, aber von Kaiser Karl zu lebenslangem Kerker begnadigt (und zum Ende der Monarchie 1918 freigelassen). Der äußerst erschütterte Vater schrieb diese Tat dem „beinahe pathologischen Idealismus“ des Kriegsgegners Friedrich zu. Am 11. Dezember 1916 forderte die Landeskonferenz der deutschen Sozialdemokratie in Niederösterreich neben einem annexionslosen Frieden von der k.k. Regierung auch die vollständige und sofortige Freigabe der Erörterung der Kriegsziele in Presse und Versammlungen, die durch die Kriegszensur verhindert wurde. Bei einer sozialdemokratischen Friedensversammlung am 28. Dezember 1916 reagierte Adler positiv auf das inzwischen erfolgte Friedensangebot der Mittelmächte, von dessen Ernst er überzeugt war. Diplomaten und Politiker hätten endlich die Gedanken des Friedens, die bei den Sozialdemokraten seit Kriegsbeginn verfolgt wurden, propagiert. Bisher sei das nicht möglich gewesen, denn wenn man stärker sei, wolle man den Frieden nicht machen; wenn man schwächer sei, könne man nicht, um kein Zeichen der Schwäche zu geben. Nun wolle man einen baldigen Frieden, in dem kein Staat gedemütigt werde, aber keinen Friedensschluss, der die Keime eines zukünftigen Krieges in sich trage. Seit der Oktoberrevolution von 1917 war die russische Bedrohung vorbei und Adler gab seine ursprüngliche Politik resignativer Anpassung auf. Den seit Einberufung des Parlaments im Frühjahr 1917 gewachsenen Einfluss der Partei setzte er ein, um innenpolitische Konzessionen und eine Verstärkung der Friedensbereitschaft der Regierung zu erreichen. Im Zusammenhang mit den Verhandlungen in Brest-Litowsk wurde Adler die Notwendigkeit, die Politik des k.u.k. Außenministers Czernins gegenüber den imperialistischen Ambitionen der dritten Obersten Heeresleitung des Deutschen Reiches zu unterstützen, klar. Zwischen dem 3. und 25. Jänner 1918 erfasste der so genannte Jännerstreik weite Teile der Monarchie. Über 700.000 Arbeiter traten in den Ausstand, vor allem wegen der materiell bedrängten Situation, aber auch wegen der durch Brest-Litowsk genährten Friedenserwartungen. Die Jännerstreiks, deren politische Ursachen auch die den Frieden gefährdenden deutschen Kriegsziele in Brest-Litowsk waren, benutzte Adler, um das Kabinett in Wien gegen die Annexionsforderungen in Brest festzulegen. Otto Bauer wiederum nützte sie zum Versuch, die sozialdemokratische Nationalitätenpolitik in Richtung Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Völker und großdeutsche sozialistische Allianz zu ändern. Das neue Nationalitätenprogramm der Linken zielte in der Sache auf die Auflösung der Monarchie in selbstständige Nationalstaaten und die Vereinigung der deutschen Gebiete mit dem Deutschen Reich. Adler hingegen hielt am Programm einer Demokratisierung Altösterreichs und der Schaffung eines Nationalitätenbundesstaates fest. Adler errang schließlich die Zustimmung zum Abbruch des Streiks, weil die Militärs nicht gezögert hätten, mit militärischer Gewalt gegen den Streik vorzugehen. Dennoch gelang es ihm, die Einheit der Partei zu bewahren, indem er den linken Flügel mit Bauer als seinem Stellvertreter und designierten Nachfolger einbinden konnte. Die Parteiführung um Adler verlangte am 16. Jänner 1918 in einem Aufruf: Adlers Ablehnung der Zimmerwalder Bewegung, die den Krieg seit 1915 als „Krieg der Kapitalisten“ bezeichnete, dem die internationale Arbeiterbewegung Frieden und Solidarität entgegenzusetzen habe, beruhte auch auf der irrigen Auffassung, die deutsche Regierung sei im Frühjahr 1918 zu maßvollen Friedensbedingungen, vor allem im Westen, bereit. Die deutschen Sozialdemokraten, die ihn dies glauben machten, wollten allerdings aus innenpolitischen Gründen selbst nicht auf Elsaß-Lothringen verzichten. Adlers Fernziel im Osten war ein unabhängiges Polen, Galizien bliebe bei der Monarchie, was eine staatenbündische Lösung im Rahmen der Gesamtmonarchie oder eine mitteleuropäische Neuordnung verlangte. Adlers Haltung zum Krieg beruhte letztlich auf einer Fehleinschätzung der Kriegsziele der Mittelmächte. Staatsamt und Tod In einer Rede in der Provisorischen Nationalversammlung für Deutschösterreich im November 1918 bezeichnete Adler den Zusammenbruch der Habsburgermonarchie als „eine Teilerscheinung des allgemeinen Sieges der Demokratie“ in der ganzen Kulturwelt, die es ermöglichen werde, „auf den Trümmern der kapitalistischen Weltordnung den Sozialismus aufzurichten“. Er machte sich nach Mommsen allerdings „Illusionen“ über einen unblutigen Übergang zu einer „demokratischen Gesellschaft“. In der am 30. Oktober 1918 vom Vollzugsausschuss (später Staatsrat) der Provisorischen Nationalversammlung bestellten ersten Regierung des neuen Staates, der Staatsregierung Renner I, war Adler, obwohl bereits schwer herzkrank, bis zu seinem Tod am 11. November 1918 Staatssekretär des Äußeren (Außenminister). Er traf in dieser Funktion in Schloss Schönbrunn mit Kaiser Karl und Kaiserin Zita zusammen, um über den Übergang von der alten zur neuen Ordnung zu verhandeln. Nachdem sein ursprünglicher Vorschlag eines demokratischen Nationalitätenbundesstaates mangels Interesses der anderen Nationalitäten Altösterreichs gescheitert war, trat er für den Anschluss Deutschösterreichs an das Deutsche Reich ein. Dieser wurde von der Provisorischen Nationalversammlung am 12. November 1918, dem Tag nach Adlers Tod, ebenso wie die Republik als definitive Staatsform beschlossen. An den Vorbereitungen dazu hatte Adler noch mitgewirkt. Nachleben Otto Bauer schrieb später in der Einleitung zu Adlers Aufsätzen, Reden und Briefen: Adlers Politik war, die Radikalen einzubinden und dadurch gewaltsame Revolten zu verhindern. Dadurch sicherte er Deutschösterreich den weitgehend gewaltlosen Übergang von der Monarchie zur demokratischen Verfassung der Ersten Republik mit der Besonderheit der unmittelbaren Souveränität des Parlaments. Sein Wunsch einer Angliederung an Deutschland resultierte auch aus der Befürchtung, Deutschösterreich könne aufgrund seiner autoritären inneren Strukturen und Traditionen allein nicht imstande sein, Demokratie zu praktizieren. Adlers Politik des demokratischen Sozialismus verurteilte dessen Gegner innerhalb der Arbeiterbewegung auf Dauer zu einer unsignifikanten Minderheit. Anfang der 1920er-Jahre wurde Adlers Privatbibliothek von der Sozialwissenschaftlichen Studienbibliothek der Kammer für Arbeiter und Angestellte für Wien erworben. |
G;|Georges Jacques Danton (* 26. Oktober 1759 in Arcis-sur-Aube, Département Aube; † 5. April 1794 in Paris) war ein französischer Revolutionär und Politiker, der während der Französischen Revolution Justizminister und Leiter des ersten Wohlfahrtsausschusses gewesen ist. Weil er sich gegen die Fortsetzung der von ihm selbst mitinstallierten Terrorherrschaft aussprach, wurde er 1794 als angeblicher Verschwörer gegen die Revolution hingerichtet.  Frühe Jahre Danton stammte aus einer kleinbürgerlichen Familie. Sein Vater war der Steuerbevollmächtigte Jacques Danton, seine Mutter Madeleine war eine geborene Camut. Er war das sechste von sieben überlebenden Kindern der Eheleute. Als er zwei Jahre alt war, starb sein Vater. 1770 heiratete seine Mutter den Besitzer einer Baumwollspinnerei Jean Recordain. Als Junge hatte er zwei Unfälle mit Rindern, von denen er eine gespaltene, wulstige Oberlippe und eine eingedrückte Nase davontrug. Außerdem hatten die Pocken Narben in seinem Gesicht hinterlassen. Er besuchte zunächst die Schule in Sézanne und verließ dann dreizehnjährig sein Elternhaus, um in das Priesterseminar in Troyes einzutreten; zusätzlich nahm er am Schulunterricht der dortigen Oratorianer teil. Im Juli 1775 wanderte er auf eigene Faust nach Reims, um an der Königsweihe Ludwigs XVI. teilzunehmen. 1775 verließ er Schule und Seminar. Was er in den folgenden fünf Jahren tat, ist nicht überliefert. 1780 ging er nach Paris und wurde Schreiber bei einem Anwalt beim parlement. Hier lernte er die Praxis des französischen Rechtswesens kennen und las auch die gängige aufklärerische Literatur seiner Zeit. 1784 legte er in Reims das juristische Examen ab und durfte sich fortan Advokat nennen. Für das Jahr 1788 wird er in den Registern der Freimaurerloge Neuf Sœurs erwähnt, doch ist sein Beitrittsdatum unbekannt und das Ausmaß seiner freimaurerischen Aktivitäten und Kontakte umstritten. 1787 kaufte er dem Anwalt Charles-Nicolas Huet für 68.000 Livres die Klientel und den Titel eines der 73 Rechtsanwälte bei den Conseils du Roi ab. Diese Gerichte entsprachen dem heutigen Kassationshof in Frankreich und dem Conseil d’État. Das Geld musste er sich großenteils leihen, wobei ihm Verwandte aus Arcis und sein künftiger Schwiegervater halfen. Außerdem musste Danton eine weitere juristische Prüfung einer lateinisch gehaltenen Rede über ein vorgegebenes Thema ablegen, was ihm im Juli 1787 gelang. Anschließend konnte er sich als Anwalt installieren. Bis zum Rückkauf aller gekauften Ämter im Jahre 1791 führte „maitre d'Anton“, wie er sich nun nannte (das eingefügte Apostroph sollte einen Adelstitel suggerieren) 22 Prozesse an den conseils du Roi. Diese Tätigkeit erlaubte ihm und seiner Familie – er hatte im Juni 1787 geheiratet – ein auskömmliches Leben in einer Sechszimmerwohnung in der rue des Cordeliers, nur wenige Häuser entfernt von Jean-Paul Marat. In der Anfangszeit der Französischen Revolution Im Juli 1789 meldete er sich freiwillig zur Garde nationale im Pariser Distrikt der Cordeliers, zu dessen Präsidenten er im Oktober gewählt wurde. Nach der Aufhebung der Distrikte 1790 engagierte er sich gemeinsam mit Camille Desmoulins und Jean Paul Marat im radikalen Club des Cordeliers, wenig später begann er auch den Jakobinerclub zu besuchen. Danton beteiligte sich nach der misslungenen Flucht des Königs Ludwig XVI. als engagierter Befürworter einer Republik an einer Versammlung auf dem Marsfeld, die am 17. Juli 1791 in einer Unterschriftensammlung den Sturz des Königs sowie die Einführung der Republik forderte. Dabei feuerten Soldaten der Regierung in die Menge. Dies Ereignis wurde als Massaker auf dem Marsfeld bekannt. Als Mitorganisator wurde Danton polizeilich gesucht, entzog sich aber seiner Verhaftung durch eine Flucht, zunächst nach Arcis-sur-Aube, dann nach London, von wo er anlässlich der Wahlen zur Gesetzgebenden Nationalversammlung im September 1791 zurückkehrte. Danton wurde als Wahlmann der Pariser Sektion Théâtre Français gewählt. Im gleichen Jahr wurde er zum Stellvertreter des Staatsanwalts der Kommune von Paris gewählt. Der Historiker Albert Soboul (1914–1982) ist überzeugt, dass Danton „vom Hof gekauft“ wurde, er habe aber keine großen Zugeständnisse gemacht. Nach eigenen Angaben spielte Danton durch diese Propaganda eine wesentliche Rolle beim Sturm auf die Tuilerien und der Inhaftierung der königlichen Familie am 10. August 1792. Im selben Jahr übernahm er den Posten des Justizministers im mehrheitlich girondistischen Exekutivrat, wo er bald eine dominierende Rolle spielte. Während des Ersten Koalitionskriegs trat er für entschlossenen Widerstand gegen die Invasionstruppen ein. Gegen Innenminister Jean-Marie Roland de La Platière setzte er durch, dass die Regierung in Paris blieb und nicht in das sicherer scheinende Gebiet südlich der Loire floh. Während der Septembermorde des Jahres 1792 schritt er nicht ein: Laut Madame Roland erklärte er, das Schicksal der Gefängnisinsassen sei ihm vollkommen gleichgültig. Im September 1792 wurde Danton als Abgeordneter für Paris in den Nationalkonvent gewählt, woraufhin er sein Ministeramt niederlegte. Im Nationalkonvent Im Nationalkonvent suchte Danton zunächst den Ausgleich zwischen den Parteien, der Bergpartei und den regierenden Girondisten. Diese jedoch versuchten die Opposition zu vernichten und erhoben Korruptionsvorwürfe gegen den ehemaligen Minister Danton, weshalb dieser sich der demokratischen Opposition annäherte. An der Debatte darüber, ob der ehemalige König Ludwig XVI. hingerichtet werden sollte, nahm Danton nicht teil, weil er sich auf Truppenbesuch bei General Charles-François Dumouriez in Belgien aufhielt. Bei der Abstimmung im Konvent votierte er für die Todesstrafe. Am 31. Januar 1793 sprach sich Danton für die Annexion Belgiens und weiterer Gebiete aus: Nach Dumouriez‘ Misserfolgen und Verrat rief er wie schon im Jahr zuvor zu verstärkten militärischen Anstrengungen auf. Am 9. März 1793 machte er sich die Forderung mehrerer Sektionen nach einem außerordentlichen Gerichtshof zur Aburteilung feindlicher Agenten im Innern zu eigen: In Anspielung auf die Septembermorde rief er aus: „Wir müssen das tun, was die gesetzgebende Versammlung nicht getan hat: wir müssen schrecklich sein, um dem Volk zu ersparen, es zu sein“. Am 10. März wurden vom Konvent gegen die Stimmen der Girondisten, die Danton vorwarfen, er strebe nach der Diktatur, die später so genannten Revolutionstribunale beschlossen. Sein weiterer Vorschlag, ein Komitee mit weitreichenden Exekutivvollmachten einzurichten, wurde zunächst zurückgewiesen. Weil Danton kurz zuvor als Abgesandter des Konvents zu Dumouriez geschickt worden war, bezichtigten ihn die Girondisten, mit dem General gemeinsame Sache zu machen; Danton drehte den Vorwurf am 1. April geschickt um und trug so zum Niedergang der Girondisten bei. Am 6. April 1793 wurde der von Danton vorgeschlagene Wohlfahrtsausschuss schließlich doch eingerichtet, in dem Danton ein dominierendes Mitglied wurde. Nach dem gewaltsamen Sturz der Girondisten durch die Erhebung der Pariser Sansculotten vom 31. Mai bis 2. Juni 1793 verbündete er sich endgültig mit der Bergpartei. „Ohne die Kanonen vom 31. Mai, ohne den Aufstand, würden die Verschwörer triumphieren“, rief er am 13. Juni 1793 aus. Trotz seiner wirkungsvollen Rhetorik blieben die konkreten Abwehrmaßnahmen von Dantons Wohlfahrtsausschuss kraftlos und ohne große Erfolge. Seine Versuche, durch diplomatische Verhandlungen mit dem britischen Außenminister Lord Grenville eine Lösung der Krise zu finden, scheiterten rasch und trug ihm Verdächtigungen von Cordeliers ein, er plane die gefangene Marie Antoinette freizulassen oder sogar die radikalen Demokraten wiedereinzuführen. Dies führte zum Bruch zwischen Danton und seinen Anhängern und den Cordeliers. Bei der Neuwahl des Wohlfahrtsausschuss am 10. Juli 1793 wurde er nicht wiedergewählt. Stattdessen übernahm er am 25. Juli den Vorsitz des Nationalkonvents. In dieser Position forderte Danton in einer Rede am 1. August 1793, angesichts der Bedrohungen der Revolution durch den Koalitionskrieg und den Aufstand der Vendée den Wohlfahrtsausschuss des Nationalkonvents als Notstandsregierung einzusetzen. Darin rief er erneut zu Terrormaßnahmen gegen die Feinde der Revolution und einer verstärkten Anstrengung im Krieg auf. Als die terreur dann tatsächlich in Gang kam, versuchte Danton zu mäßigen. So ließ er die Zahl der wöchentlichen Sitzungen der Pariser Sektionen beschränken. Nachdem der Wohlfahrtsausschuss am 10. Oktober tatsächlich die von ihm geforderten unbeschränkten Vollmachten erhalten hatte, zog sich Danton für mehrere Wochen nach Arcis-sur-Aube zurück. Sturz und Tod Als Danton im November 1793 nach Paris zurückkehrte, war die Kampagne der Hébertisten für eine radikale Entchristianisierung in vollem Gange. Danton solidarisierte sich mit Robespierre, der gegen diese Bewegung vorging. Unter Wortführung Camille Desmoulins‘, des Herausgebers des Vieux cordelier, polemisierten die Dantonisten gegen die Hébertisten und die radikalen Revolutionäre, denen sie unterstellten, allesamt Agenten des britischen Premierministers William Pitt zu sein. Indirekt zielten die Angriffe auch gegen die Regierung und den Terror, dessen Fortsetzung nach der Beruhigung der militärischen Lage nicht mehr nötig schien. Am 1. Dezember 1793 erklärte Danton, die Sansculotten, die wiederholt mit Piken bewaffnet in die Politik eingegriffen hatten, hätten nun ausgespielt: Deswegen wurden Danton und seine Anhänger von Robespierre abschätzig Indulgenten (die Nachgiebigen) genannt. Albert Soboul vermutet, Danton habe mit dieser zweigleisigen Politik seiner Anhänger den Wohlfahrtsausschuss spalten und dessen Macht dadurch begrenzen wollen. Vielleicht habe er damit auch versucht, persönliche Freunde zu retten, die in die so genannte Verschwörung des Auslands oder wie Fabre d’Églantine in die Korruptionsaffäre um die Auflösung der Französischen Ostindienkompanie verwickelt gewesen sein sollen. Seine Forderung, sie vor einer Verurteilung erst anzuhören, trug ihm selbst im Januar 1794 erneute Verdächtigungen ein. Im März 1794 beendete der Wohlfahrtsausschuss die Polemik zwischen den Dantonisten, die für eine Mäßigung des Terrors eintraten, und den Hébertisten, die seine Verschärfung verlangten, indem er diese zum Tode verurteilen ließ. Noch vor der Hinrichtung Jacques-René Héberts beschloss er auch die Verhaftung Dantons und seiner Anhänger. Ihr Sprachrohr, der Vieux cordelier, durfte nicht mehr erscheinen. Robespierre erklärte, gemeinsam mit den von ihnen bekämpften Hébertisten seien die Dantonisten Teil der „Verschwörung des Auslands“, deren Ziel eine Niederlage Frankreichs im Koalitionskrieg sei. Trotz wiederholter Warnungen kehrte Danton, der sich zu einem Kurzurlaub in Sèvres aufhielt, am 29. März nach Paris zurück, weil er sich nicht vorstellen konnte, dass sich der Terror gegen ihn selbst richten würde: „Ils n’oseront pas!“, „sie werden es nicht wagen“, soll er wiederholt gesagt haben. Am 30. März 1794 wurde Danton gemeinsam mit Desmoulins, Jean-François Delacroix und Pierre Philippeaux verhaftet und zunächst in das Luxembourg-Gefängnis verbracht. Im Nationalkonvent wurde am gleichen Tag zunächst Kritik an den Verhaftungen laut, die Robespierre mit Drohungen zum Schweigen brachte: Louis Antoine de Saint-Just trug die Vorwürfe gegen die Dantonisten im Zusammenhang vor: Beide Faktionen, Héberts „falsche Patrioten“ und Dantons Indulgenten, würden bei aller Gegensätzlichkeit in Wahrheit dasselbe Ziel verfolgen, nämlich die Revolution rückgängig zu machen. Es gebe nur zwei politische Richtungen in Frankreich, die wahren Patrioten und die bestechlichen „Komplizen des Auslands“. Ausführlich ließ Saint-Just die nicht immer konsequenten Handlungen und Unterlassungen Dantons und seine persönlichen Beziehungen seit 1790 Revue passieren und deutete sie alle als Belege für konterrevolutionäre Konspiration und Korruption: Der Konvent stimmte daraufhin einstimmig dafür, Danton und seine Freunde als royalistische Verschwörer anzuklagen. Die Verhafteten wurden nun in die Conciergerie überstellt. Gegen seine erklärte Absicht, sich selbst zu verteidigen, bekam Danton einen Pflichtverteidiger zugewiesen. Im Prozess vor dem Revolutionstribunal, der am 2. April unter dem Vorsitz von Martial Joseph Armand Herman in der Salle de la Liberté des Justizpalastes eröffnet wurde, pflichtete er zumeist dem Ankläger Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville bei. Unter den insgesamt vierzehn Angeklagten befanden sich neben Danton und seinen oben erwähnten Anhängern auch Fabre d’Eglatine, General François-Joseph Westermann, der den Vendée-Aufstand niedergeschlagen hatte, der Abgeordnete Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles sowie einige bestechliche Konventsabgeordnete, angebliche Agenten des Auslands und Spekulanten. Diese Kombination politischer und finanzieller Delikte sollte einen Schuldspruch garantieren. Die Richter waren für den Fall, dass sie Milde zeigten, mit Bestrafung bedroht worden, und statt der üblichen zwölf gab es nur sieben Geschworene, da man für die heikle Aufgabe, den beliebten Revolutionär abzuurteilen, sonst niemand fand. Während des Prozesses gab Danton sarkastische Bonmots zum Besten: So erwiderte er zu Beginn auf die Frage nach seinem Wohnort: „Bald im Nichts, danach im Pantheon der Geschichte! Was macht es mir schon aus!“ Er forderte, Entlastungszeugen vorzuladen und im Konvent einen Ausschuss zu bilden, der das diktatorische System des Wohlfahrtsausschusses untersuchen solle. Am 3. April hielt er eine großangelegte Verteidigungsrede, in der er alle Vorwürfe der Anklage zurückwies und sich als konsequenten und uneigennützigen Kämpfer für die Revolution darstellte. Da das Protokoll des Prozesses als unzuverlässig gilt, besteht über den genauen Inhalt seiner Ausführungen keine Sicherheit. Es scheint ihm jedoch gelungen zu sein, das Publikum auf seine Seite zu ziehen. Richter Herman unterbrach nach einigen Stunden Dantons Rede und schlug vor, den Rest auf den Folgetag zu verschieben. Danton willigte ein, bekam am folgenden Tag das Wort aber nicht wieder erteilt. Zunächst wurden die Aussagen anderer Angeklagter gehört, dann brachte ein Bote einen Beschluss des Konvents, wonach „jeder Verschwörer, der sich Gerichtsbarkeit der Nation widersetzt oder sie beschimpft, […] von der Sitzung ausgeschlossen werden“ könne. Dieser Beschluss, um den Fouquier-Tinville und Herman dringlich gebeten hatten, war von Saint-Just ohne Aussprache durchs Parlament gebracht worden. Herman wendete ihn am 5. April an, als die Angeklagten heftig gegen Fouquier-Tinvilles Vorschlag protestierten, die Anhörung vorzeitig zu beenden, falls die Geschworenen sich für hinreichend informiert erklärten. Alle Angeklagten wurden zurück in die Conciergerie gebracht. Im Gerichtssaal wurde anschließend ein angebliches Beweisstück präsentiert: Ein in Dantons Wohnung gefundener Brief eines englischen Agenten vom September 1793, der einen Bankier anwies, „C.D.“ für konterrevolutionäre Dienste zu entlohnen. Das konnte „citoyen Danton“ heißen, aber auch „Camille Desmoulins“, die Zuordnung ist nicht sicher. Die Geschworenen erklärten sich nun für hinreichend informiert und sprachen alle vierzehn Angeklagten schuldig; nach Einschätzung von Dantons Biographen Frédéric Bluche ein klarer Justizmord. Das Todesurteil wurde den Angeklagten von einem Gerichtsdiener im Gefängnis vorgelesen, anschließend wurden sie auf Karren zur Place de la Révolution transportiert, wo die Guillotine stand. Danton bestieg als letzter der Vierzehn das Schaffott. Seine letzten Worte sollen an den Henker Charles Henri Sanson gerichtet gewesen sein: „Vergiß vor allem nicht, dem Volk meinen Kopf zu zeigen; er ist gut anzusehen“. Sein Leichnam wurde in einem Massengrab auf dem Cimetière des Errancis im 8. Arrondissement bestattet. Danton wurde 34  Jahre alt. Privatleben 1787 heiratete er Antoinette Charpentier, die Tochter des Wirts im Café de l‘ Ecole, wo er in seiner Zeit als Advokat häufig verkehrte. Mit ihr hatte er drei Söhne, der älteste starb im Alter von einem Jahr. Antoinette Danton kam am 12. Februar 1793 bei der Geburt ihres vierten Kindes ums Leben, das gleichfalls nicht überlebte. Am 17. Juni 1793 nahm Danton die erst sechzehnjährige Sebastienne-Louise Gely zur Frau, die ihren Mann um Jahrzehnte überlebte. Sie starb 1856. |
G;Lena Johanna Therese Meyer-Landrut (* 23. Mai 1991 in Hannover) ist eine deutsche Sängerin und Songwriterin. Als Interpretin des Liedes Satellite gewann sie am 29. Mai 2010 den Eurovision Song Contest und errang damit den zweiten Sieg für Deutschland bei diesem Wettbewerb. Im Jahr 2011 trat sie mit dem Lied Taken by a Stranger erneut an und erreichte dabei den zehnten Rang. Seit der Veröffentlichung ihres ersten Albums tritt sie als Lena auf.  Jugend und Ausbildung Lena Meyer-Landrut wuchs als Einzelkind im hannoverschen Stadtbezirk Misburg-Anderten bei ihrer alleinerziehenden Mutter auf. Ihr Vater verließ die Familie, als sie zwei Jahre alt war. Sie ist väterlicherseits eine Enkelin des deutschen Diplomaten Andreas Meyer-Landrut und Nichte zweiten Grades des ehemaligen EU-Koordinators im Bundeskanzleramt Nikolaus Meyer-Landrut, der seit 2015 Botschafter der Bundesrepublik Deutschland in Frankreich ist. Im Juni 2010 beendete sie die Schulzeit an der IGS Roderbruch mit dem Abitur. Im Wintersemester 2011 schrieb sie sich für die Studiengänge Sprachen und Kulturen Afrikas sowie Philosophie an der Universität zu Köln ein. Wegen des Beginns der Arbeiten für ihr drittes Album nahm sie das Studium jedoch nicht auf. Künstlerischer Werdegang Während der Schulzeit wandte sich Meyer-Landrut nach Ballett und Jazz Dance dem aus Hip-Hop, Jazz- und Ausdruckstanz bestehenden Show-Dance zu. Daneben fand sie Gefallen am Gesang. 2009 wirkte sie als Laiendarstellerin in den Fernsehserien K11 – Kommissare im Einsatz, Helfen Sie mir! und Richter Alexander Hold mit. 2010: Unser Star für Oslo und My Cassette Player Im Herbst 2009 bewarb sich Meyer-Landrut für die von der ARD und ProSieben ausgerichtete Castingshow Unser Star für Oslo, dem deutschen Vorentscheid zum Eurovision Song Contest 2010. Sie wurde für den engeren Kandidatenkreis ausgewählt und trat in der ersten Fernsehshow mit dem Song My Same der britischen Soul- und Popsängerin Adele auf. Die damals 18-jährige Schülerin erntete großes Lob von den Juroren um Veranstalter Stefan Raab. Adele bezeichnete die Version von Meyer-Landrut als „faszinierend“. Die Originalfassung des Songs platzierte sich – ebenso wie das später von ihr gesungene New Shoes von Paolo Nutini – erst nach ihrem Castingshow-Auftritt in den deutschen Singlecharts. Auch Kate Nashs Foundations, Neopolitan Dreams von Lisa Mitchell und Jason Mraz’ Mr. Curiosity kamen nach Meyer-Landruts Interpretation in die deutschen Singlecharts zurück. Schon vor dem Finale galt Meyer-Landrut als Favoritin. Sie gewann den Wettbewerb gegen die gleichaltrige Schülerin Jennifer Braun mit dem Lied Satellite von Julie Frost und John Gordon und erhielt einen Plattenvertrag bei Universal Music. Meyer-Landrut war nach Wyn Hoop (1960) die zweite deutsche Eurovision-Song-Contest-Teilnehmerin aus Hannover. Einen Tag nach dem Gewinn von Unser Star für Oslo belegte Meyer-Landrut mit den Finalsongs Satellite, Bee und dem von Raab eigens für sie komponierten Love Me, dessen Text sie selbst verfasst hat, als erste deutsche Sängerin die ersten drei Plätze großer Download-Portale wie iTunes und Musicload. Gleichzeitig stellte sie mit den Singles einen Verkaufsrekord auf. Als erste Interpretin konnte sie auf Anhieb drei Titel in den Top Five der deutschen Single-Charts platzieren. Satellite erreichte Platz eins der deutschen und Schweizer Hitparade und Platz 2 in Österreich. Unter dem Künstlernamen Lena veröffentlichte sie am 7. Mai 2010 ihr Debütalbum My Cassette Player, das sofort auf Platz 1 der deutschen Charts und auf Platz 3 in Österreich und der Schweiz landete. Als Vertreterin eines der vier größten EBU-Beitragszahler war Meyer-Landrut direkt für das Finale des Eurovision Song Contest 2010 qualifiziert. Über eine Deutschland zugeloste Wildcard wählte der verantwortliche NDR den Startplatz 22 (von 25) aus. Meyer-Landrut trat mit vier Backgroundsängerinnen auf und siegte mit 246 Punkten (→ Punktevergabe für Deutschland) vor der Band maNga aus der Türkei (170 Punkte) und dem rumänischen Duo Paula Seling und Ovi (162 Punkte). Es war der zweite Sieg für einen deutschen Beitrag nach Nicoles Erfolg 1982. Die Reichweite von 14,69 Millionen Fernsehzuschauern und ein Marktanteil von 49,1 Prozent in Deutschland bedeuteten das höchste Zuschauerinteresse an einem Eurovision Song Contest seit Einführung des Privatfernsehens. Im Verlauf der Bekanntgabe der Punkteverteilung wuchs die Zuschauerzahl auf 20,45 Millionen an. Einen Tag nach dem Finale wurde Meyer-Landrut vom damaligen niedersächsischen Ministerpräsidenten Christian Wulff in ihrer Heimatstadt Hannover empfangen. Sie durfte sich ins Goldene Buch der Stadt eintragen und wurde anschließend von etwa 40.000 Fans gefeiert. Bereits zwei Tage nach dem Finale stieg der Siegertitel auf Platz 1 der norwegischen Charts. Danach belegte er auch die ersten Plätze in Schweden, Finnland, Schweiz, Dänemark sowie erneut in Deutschland. Meyer-Landrut erreichte mit ihrer Debütsingle Platzierungen in weiteren europäischen Ländern sowie in Australien. Von Mitte Juni bis Anfang August 2010 absolvierte Meyer-Landrut ihre erste Promotiontour durch europäische Städte: London, Paris, Amsterdam, Wien, Brüssel, Oslo, Malmö, Helsingborg, Stockholm und Zürich. Neben zahlreichen Radio-, Zeitungs- und Fernsehinterviews hatte Meyer-Landrut Live-Auftritte in der norwegischen Fernsehsendung Allsang på Grensen und in der schwedischen Fernsehsendung Sommarkrysset. Neben Safura, Didrik Solli-Tangen, Anna Bergendahl und Hera Björk trat sie beim Schlagerfestival auf der Stockholm Pride auf. Am 6. August 2010 erschien ihre vierte Single Touch a New Day, die von Raab geschrieben und produziert wurde. Im Oktober 2010 kam der belgische 3D-Animationsfilm Sammys Abenteuer – Die Suche nach der geheimen Passage in die Kinos, bei dem Meyer-Landrut dem Schildkrötenmädchen Shelly die deutsche Stimme lieh. Die Synchronarbeiten fanden im Juni 2010 in der Berliner Synchron statt und waren nach zwei Tagen abgeschlossen. Im September 2010 engagierte der Automobilhersteller Adam Opel AG Meyer-Landrut für ein Jahr als Werbeträgerin, u. a. für ein auch namentlich an ihren ESC-Hit angelehntes Sondermodell Corsa Satellite. Im März 2011 hatte Meyer-Landrut zwei Gastauftritte in Anke Engelkes Sketch-Comedy Ladykracher. Im April 2011 war sie in einem Sesamstraßen-Special zu sehen, wo sie ihren Hit Satellite unter dem Titel Bert, oh Bert auf Deutsch interpretierte. 2011: Unser Song für Deutschland und Good News Die Idee, Meyer-Landrut beim Eurovision Song Contest 2011 in Düsseldorf als Titelverteidigerin erneut antreten zu lassen, stammte von Stefan Raab, der diesen Vorschlag bereits auf der Pressekonferenz kurz nach dem Sieg beim ESC in den Raum gestellt hatte. In der deutschen Vorentscheidung Unser Song für Deutschland wählten die Fernsehzuschauer das Lied für den ESC. Dabei stellte Meyer-Landrut in zwei Halbfinalshows, die am 31. Januar und 7. Februar bei ProSieben live übertragen wurden, jeweils sechs Lieder vor, von denen je drei in das Finale der Vorausscheidung kamen. Alle Songs und die jeweiligen Hintergründe ihrer Entstehung – einige hatten Stefan Raab und Lena komponiert, ein anderer stammte auch vom Sänger Aloe Blacc, nachdem er bei TV total zu Gast gewesen war – wurden vorher regelmäßig bei TV total vorgestellt. In der am 18. Februar von der ARD übertragenen Livesendung entschieden sich die Zuschauer für das von den kalifornischen Komponisten Gus Seyffert und Nicole Morier zusammen mit der norwegischen Sängerin Monica Birkenes geschriebene Lied Taken by a Stranger. Meyer-Landruts zweites Studioalbum Good News, das am 8. Februar 2011 veröffentlicht wurde, enthält alle Beiträge der deutschen Vorentscheidung. Wie ihr Debütalbum schaffte es auch Good News an die Spitze der deutschen Albumcharts und erreichte nach einer Woche Goldstatus. Am 1. März 2011 erreichte sie als erste deutsche Künstlerin mit sechs Liedern (fünf Neueinsteiger und einem Wiedereinsteiger) gleichzeitig die Top 100 der deutschen Single-Charts. Bei der Echoverleihung 2011 gewann sie einen ECHO in der Kategorie Erfolgreichster Newcomer National und einen in der Kategorie Erfolgreichste Künstlerin National. Außerdem war sie in drei anderen Kategorien nominiert. Vom 13. bis zum 29. April 2011 absolvierte Meyer-Landrut ihre erste Tournee. Die Lena Live Tour 2011 führte durch die neun Städte Berlin, Hannover, Frankfurt, Dortmund, Hamburg, Leipzig, München, Stuttgart und Köln. Bereits etwa acht Monate vor ihrem Start löste die Tour ein ungewöhnliches Medienecho aus. Es gab Spekulationen über einen schleppenden Vorverkauf sowie Äußerungen einiger prominenter Künstler, welche die Sorge äußerten, dass die Hallen für eine unerfahrene Newcomerin zu groß seien. Die Besucherzahl der gesamten Tour wurde auf ca. 75.000 geschätzt. Auf den ersten sechs Konzerten wurde sie von der Rock-Band kleinstadthelden und auf den letzten drei von der Indiepop-Gruppe Mikroboy als Vorgruppen begleitet. Die Tourband bestand aus Andreas Grimm (Bandleader, Keyboard), Mathias Höderath (Keyboard), Alex Vesper (Schlagzeug), Bruno Müller (Gitarre), Nico Brandenburg (Bass) sowie Bastian Ruppert (Gitarre, Posaune). Unterstützt wurden Sängerin und Band von den Backgroundsängerinnen Anji Hinke, Grace Risch und Maya Saban sowie einer vierköpfigen Streichergruppe. Die Tänzerinnen stammten aus dem Team der Choreographin Nikeata Thompson. Meyer-Landrut präsentierte bei der Tour insgesamt 21 Songs (inklusive dreier Zugaben) ihrer beiden ersten Alben sowie erstmals den Song Who’d Want to Find Love. Das Konzert am 15. April 2011 in der Frankfurter Festhalle wurde aufgezeichnet und am 9. Mai 2011 unter dem Titel Good News – Live als DVD veröffentlicht. Am 14. Mai sang Meyer-Landrut in der Düsseldorf Arena vor 36.000 Zuschauern zum zweiten Mal beim ESC für Deutschland. Mit ihrem Beitrag Taken by a Stranger erreichte sie den 10. Platz. Zur Eröffnung des Song Contests sang sie zusammen mit den Moderatoren Stefan Raab, Judith Rakers und Anke Engelke eine Rockabilly-Version von Satellite. Auch dieser Version des Songs gelang der Einstieg in die Charts. Für den Matthias-Schweighöfer-Film What a Man, der im August 2011 in die Kinos kam, nahm sie das Lied What a Man auf, eine Coverversion des Linda-Lyndell-Hits aus dem Jahr 1968. Im September 2011 war sie Außenreporterin beim Bundesvision Song Contest 2011. 2012-2015: Stardust, The Voice Kids und Crystal Sky Im April 2012 wirkte sie in einer Werbekampagne zum 60. Geburtstag des Hannover Airport mit. Am 24. Mai 2012 trat sie neben den ehemaligen Songcontest-Gewinnern Alexander Rybak, Marija Šerifović, Dima Bilan und Ell & Nikki als Pausenact beim zweiten Halbfinale des Eurovision Song Contests 2012 in Baku auf. Im August 2012 wurde bekannt gegeben, dass das Titellied der Sesamstraße in einer neuen Version mit Lena Meyer-Landrut aufgenommen wurde und ab Oktober 2012 die Sendung einleitet. 2012 nahm Meyer-Landrut in Stockholm und Hamburg (Tonstudio Clouds Hill Recordings) ihr drittes Studioalbum Stardust auf, welches am 12. Oktober 2012 veröffentlicht wurde. Am 21. September 2012 wurde die gleichnamige Vorab-Single veröffentlicht, die auf Platz 2 der deutschen Single-Charts einstieg. Im Dezember 2012 und Januar 2013 wurden Album und Single mit Gold ausgezeichnet. Im März 2013 erschien die zweite Single Neon (Lonely People) aus dem Album. Bei der Echoverleihung 2013 am 21. März 2013 wurde der Videoclip zu Stardust als bestes nationales Musikvideo ausgezeichnet. Im Herbst 2012 nahm Meyer-Landrut am Albumprojekt Giraffenaffen zugunsten des Kinderhilfswerks Die Arche teil, zu dem sie das Pippi-Langstrumpf-Lied Seeräuber Opa Fabian beisteuerte. Im März 2013 war Meyer-Landrut Musikpatin bei Dein Song, dem KiKA-Songwriting-Wettbewerb für Kinder. Zusammen mit Tim Bendzko und Henning Wehland war sie Coach und Jury-Mitglied in der ersten Staffel der Sat.1-Castingshow The Voice Kids, die im April und Mai 2013 ausgestrahlt wurde. Auch 2014, 2015 und 2016 war sie erneut als Coach dabei. 2015 gewann sie mit ihrem Schützling Noah-Levi die Show. Im April 2013 absolvierte Meyer-Landrut die „No One Can Catch Us Tour“, eine Clubtour, bei der sie dreizehn deutsche Städte (Stuttgart, München, Nürnberg, Dresden, Berlin, Hamburg, Kiel, Münster, Dortmund, Köln, Saarbrücken, Hannover und Offenbach) besuchte. Die Tourband bestand aus Reiner „Kallas“ Hubert (Schlagzeug), Felix Weigt (Bass), Marcus Schneider (Gitarre), mit denen sie bereits im Studio ihr Album Stardust eingespielt hatte, sowie Katie Freudenschuss (Keyboards) und Kerstin Sund (Gitarre). Das Abschlusskonzert im Capitol in Offenbach wurde via Stream live im Internet übertragen. Am 17. Mai 2013 wurde die dritte Single aus dem Album Stardust, Mr. Arrow Key, als Download-EP veröffentlicht, welche neben der Studioversion des Titels Liveaufnahmen enthält, die auf dem Hamburger Konzert der „No One Can Catch Us Tour“ aufgezeichnet wurden. Beim Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö gehörte Meyer-Landrut gemeinsam mit Alina Süggeler, Carolin Niemczyk, Tim Bendzko und Florian Silbereisen zur deutschen Jury. Als Jurysprecherin gab sie die deutschen Abstimmungsergebnisse im Finale am 18. Mai 2013 bekannt. Im Juni 2013 wirkte Meyer-Landrut in einem Werbespot für einen von Stefan Raab neu entwickelten Duschkopf mit und seit September 2013 ist sie Markenbotschafterin für den französischen Kosmetikkonzern L’Oréal. Im Oktober 2013 wirkte Meyer-Landrut (neben Roger Cicero, Annett Louisan, Stefan Kaminski und Heinz Rudolf Kunze) als Sprecherin in den beiden Giraffenaffenhörspielen Wir sind da und Die Schatzsuche von Cally Stronk und Steffen Herzberg mit. In dem im Februar 2014 in den deutschen Kinos gestarteten Animationsfilm Tarzan 3D lieh sie Jane die deutsche Stimme. Der Film wurde im Mai 2014 mit dem Goldenen Spatz ausgezeichnet.

G;|Samuel Barclay Beckett (* 13. April 1906 in Dublin; † 22. Dezember 1989 in Paris) war ein irischer Schriftsteller. Er gilt als einer der bedeutendsten Schriftsteller des 20. Jahrhunderts und wurde 1969 mit dem Nobelpreis für Literatur ausgezeichnet. Sein bekanntestes Werk ist „Warten auf Godot“ (En attendant Godot), das am 5. Januar 1953 in Paris uraufgeführt wurde. Die erste Aufführung im deutschsprachigen Raum fand am 8. September 1953 im Schlossparktheater Berlin statt. Beckett war zunächst britischer, nach der Unabhängigkeit Irlands 1921 dann irischer Staatsbürger, lebte aber seit 1937 ständig in Frankreich. Seine ersten Texte verfasste er in englischer Sprache, in seiner mittleren und fruchtbarsten Phase schrieb er überwiegend französisch, später wechselte er zwischen beiden Sprachen, oft von Text zu Text, und übersetzte seine Werke häufig selbst in die jeweils andere Sprache.  Familie Samuel Beckett war der zweite Sohn der Eheleute Bill und May Beckett (geb. Roe). Die väterliche Linie der Familie stammte von den Hugenotten ab, die wahrscheinlich im 18. Jahrhundert aus Frankreich nach Irland kamen. Jene erwarb sich zunächst mit der Herstellung edler Stoffe einigen Reichtum und war später, seit der großväterlichen Generation, im Baugewerbe tätig. Becketts Vater selbst war als Baukalkulator vielbeschäftigtes und angesehenes Mitglied der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft Dublins. Auch May Beckett stammte aus einer achtbaren protestantischen Familie. Das Dorf Foxrock, ein Vorort Dublins, galt zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts als Adresse für Wohlhabende, die zurückgezogen und doch in der Nähe zum belebten Stadtzentrum Dublins wohnen wollten. Die Becketts lebten dort in einem großzügigen Haus (Cooldrinagh) mit einigem Landbesitz und hatten im Lauf der Jahre mehrere Dienstmädchen. Die Mutter führte den Haushalt mit Strenge, bedacht auf Sauberkeit und Umgangsformen, und galt als regelmäßige Kirchgängerin. Der Vater pflegte den geselligen Umgang, war Mitglied mehrerer Gentlemen's Clubs, spielte gerne Golf oder unternahm ausgedehnte Wanderungen. Kindheit Entgegen dem Gerücht, er habe sein Geburtsdatum manipuliert und selbst auf den 13. April verlegt, den Karfreitag als Symbol für das Leid, kam Beckett tatsächlich an diesem Tag zur Welt. Sein drei Jahre älterer Bruder hieß Frank. Seit dem fünften Lebensjahr besuchte Beckett eine Kindergartenschule in der Nähe von Foxrock, wo er u. a. bereits erste Lektionen in Französisch und Klavierstunden erhielt. Ab 1915 wurde er in die höhere Schule Earlsfort House in der Nähe der Dubliner Bahnhofs-Endstation geschickt und blieb dort insgesamt vier Jahre lang. Frühzeitig fiel er als guter Sportler auf, spielte Tennis, Cricket und Golf und erhielt Unterricht im Boxen. 1919 wechselte er in die traditionsreiche Portora Royal School, ein Internat, an dem auch Oscar Wilde einige Zeit gelernt hatte und das nach der Teilung Irlands im nördlichen Landesteil jenseits der Grenze lag. Dort entwickelte er erste literarische Interessen und las u. a. Bücher des Humoristen Stephen Leacock. Er galt als intelligenter, insgesamt jedoch nicht als herausragender Schüler und war besonders für seine guten Aufsätze und sportlichen Fähigkeiten bekannt. Jugend und literarische Anfänge Becketts Kindheit und Jugend wurden überschattet von dem erbitterten Kampf, durch den die überwiegend katholischen Iren dem protestantischen England nach fast 400 Jahren Fremdherrschaft 1921 die Unabhängigkeit abtrotzten. Im Oktober 1923, mit 17 Jahren, begann Beckett das Studium der Fächer Französisch und Italienisch am renommierten Dubliner Trinity College und reiste in diesem Zusammenhang 1926 erstmals nach Frankreich und 1927 nach Italien. Nach Abschluss seines Studiums wurde Samuel Beckett für zwei Jahre Englisch-Lektor an der Pariser École normale supérieure, der französischen Elitehochschule für Lehramtsfächer. In Paris knüpfte er Kontakt zu Literatenkreisen und lernte dabei neben den Franzosen Jules Romains, Philippe Soupault und Paul Valéry auch seinen 24 Jahre älteren Landsmann James Joyce kennen, dessen Werke er zum Teil übersetzte. Joyce hatte sich schon vor längerer Zeit aus dem politisch unruhigen, viktorianisch geprägten Irland nach Paris zurückgezogen und inzwischen, dank seines als Skandalroman betrachteten Ulysses (1922), einen gewissen Grad an Berühmtheit erlangt. In Paris machte Beckett erste ernsthafte schriftstellerische Versuche, zunächst mit Lyrik in englischer Sprache. Seit 1928 reiste er mehrfach nach Deutschland, u. a. weil er sich in seine in Kassel lebende Cousine „Peggy“ (eigentlich Ruth Margaret) Sinclair verliebt hatte. Der Liebe zu ihr setzte Beckett mit seinem Romanerstling Dream of fair to middling women (Traum von mehr bis minder schönen Frauen) (1932, veröff.1993) ein Denkmal. 1930 kehrte Beckett nach Dublin zurück und wurde Assistent im Fach Französisch am Trinity College. Doch empfand er die geregelte Tätigkeit als Last, kündigte und ging 1932, nach einer längeren Reise durch Deutschland, wieder nach Paris, um nur kurze Zeit später erneut nach Dublin zurückzukehren. 1933, nach dem plötzlichen Tod seines Vaters, widersetzte er sich dem Druck seiner Mutter, als Partner seines Bruders in die Firma einzutreten. Stattdessen ging er nach London, wo er von Zuwendungen der Mutter lebte und mühsam und oft in depressiver Stimmung als Autor Fuß zu fassen suchte. Ein Bändchen erzählender Texte, das er unter dem mehrdeutigen Titel More Pricks than Kicks (Mehr Prügel als Flügel bzw. Mehr Pimmel als siebenter Himmel) 1934 publizierte, blieb jedoch erfolglos und wurde bald verboten. Für seinen ersten Roman Murphy fand er lange Zeit keinen Verleger. 1934, während er an Murphy arbeitete, begann er in London eine Psychoanalyse bei Wilfred Bion, die zwei Jahre andauerte und ihn mit dem Psychoanalytiker C.G. Jung in Kontakt brachte, dessen Vorlesungen er besuchte. Der Entschluss zu einer Reise durch Deutschland (1936/37) – ein Tagebuch aus dieser Zeit wurde erst nach seinem Tod entdeckt – entstand wohl aus dem Bedürfnis heraus, sich nach seiner bisherigen literarischen Erfolglosigkeit neu zu orientieren. So schrieb Beckett in seinem Tagebuch: „My plans are now simply to get to Germany, & then selon le vent. I hope to be away a long, long time.“ Die ersten neun Wochen verbrachte Samuel Beckett in Hamburg, wo er Theater, Konzerte, die Universität und vor allem die Hamburger Kunsthalle besuchte. Neben der für die Öffentlichkeit zugänglichen Sammlung interessierten ihn auch die bereits von der nationalsozialistischen Kulturverwaltung ins Depot verbannten Bilder der Künstler der „Brücke“, die er nur mit besonderer Erlaubnis zu sehen bekam. In Hamburg, aber auch in den anderen Städten seiner Deutschlandreise, fand Beckett Kontakt zu der trotz Verfolgung noch existierenden modernen Kunstszene. Neben Künstlern und Künstlerinnen der ehemaligen Hamburger Sezession traf er die Sammlerin moderner Kunst Margrit Durrieu und die Kunsthistorikerin Rosa Schapire, die wegen ihrer jüdischen Herkunft diskriminiert wurde. Seinen Besuch am 25. Oktober 1936 auf dem Friedhof Ohlsdorf verarbeitet er später in der Erzählung Erste Liebe. Eine weitere längere Station von Becketts Deutschlandreise war Berlin. Hier, so hält er in seinen Tagebuchaufzeichnungen fest, war es zwar im Kronprinzenpalais noch möglich, Zeichnungen von dem Regime missliebigen Künstlern zu sehen, ihre ins Magazin verbannten Gemälde aber nicht. In Dresden, wo er engen Kontakt mit dem von den Nazis entlassenen ehemaligen Leiter der Gemäldegalerie Will Grohmann pflegte, konnte er noch Bilder von Edvard Munch, Oskar Kokoschka, Otto Dix und sogar Max Liebermann besichtigen, was ihn nach seinen Erfahrungen mit der Einstellung der damaligen deutschen Behörden Juden gegenüber verwunderte. In seiner letzten Station München schließlich war das politische Klima schon so gefährlich für die freie Kultur geworden, dass er nicht mehr an die von ihm gewünschte Literatur herankam. So brachte es, nach Becketts Aufzeichnungen, der Verleger Reinhard Piper nicht über sich, ihm eine inzwischen verbotene Biografie Ernst Barlachs auszuhändigen, da er befürchtete, Beckett könne bei der Ausreise aus Deutschland durchsucht werden. Nach der Deutschlandreise und einer kurzzeitigen Rückkehr nach Irland ließ Beckett sich im Oktober 1937 endgültig in Paris nieder. Ein entscheidender Grund dafür war die junge Pianistin Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil, die ihn, nachdem ihm bei einem Überfall von einem Unbekannten ein lebensgefährlicher Messerstich zugefügt wurde, im Krankenhaus besucht hatte und bald danach seine Lebensgefährtin und 1961 seine Ehefrau wurde. Auch sprachlich verlegte er sich aufs Französische, beispielsweise indem er Murphy (der 1938 endlich in London erschienen war) selbst ins Französische übertrug. Bei einem Besuch in Irland 1939 wurde er vom Kriegsausbruch überrascht und kehrte sofort nach Paris zurück. Ende 1940 schloss er sich dem französischen Widerstand, der Résistance, an. Als 1942 seine Widerstandszelle Réseau Gloria (Gloria SMH) an die Gestapo verraten wurde, tauchte Beckett unter und ging mit seiner Partnerin Suzanne in die unbesetzte Südhälfte Frankreichs, ins Dorf Roussillon (Vaucluse). Hier verdingte er sich als Erntehelfer und Gelegenheitsarbeiter und schrieb nachts an seinem vorerst letzten englischsprachigen Roman Watt (gedruckt erst 1953). Der Durchbruch und die Zeit der Anerkennung Nach der Befreiung Frankreichs 1944 kehrte er im April 1945 zurück nach Paris und meldete sich, nach einem kurzen Besuch in Irland, freiwillig als Rot-Kreuz-Helfer. Als solcher arbeitete er bis zum Jahresende, überwiegend als Dolmetscher, in einem Lazarett in der normannischen Kleinstadt Saint-Lô. Wieder in Paris, begann er als nunmehr französischsprachiger Autor seine fruchtbarste Schaffensphase. Zunächst hatte er allerdings Mühe, Verlage für seine Bücher zu finden, bis Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil den Verleger der Éditions de Minuit, Jérôme Lindon, für ihn gewann. Es entstanden 1946 der Roman Mercier et Camier (gedruckt erst 1970) und 1948 die Romane Molloy und Malone meurt (beide gedruckt 1951). Ebenfalls 1948 entstand das Stück En attendant Godot, für das sich zunächst kein Spielort finden ließ. Erst Anfang 1953 wurde es mit überraschendem Erfolg am Théâtre de Babylone von Roger Blin, der selbst den Pozzo spielte, aufgeführt und machte seinen Autor zu einer der Galionsfiguren des absurden Theaters. Ab 1946 entstanden die Erzählungen des Bandes Textes pour rien (1956), 1949 der Roman L'Innomable (gedruckt 1953) und 1954–56 ein weiteres Stück: Fin de partie (Uraufführung 1957). 1953 fing Beckett an, beginnend mit Molloy, seine französisch verfassten Werke ins Englische zu übertragen. Dies brachte ihn dazu, teilweise wieder englisch zu schreiben, wobei er diese Texte anschließend meistens ins Französische übertrug. 1956 konzipierte er, beginnend mit All that fall, für den englischen Radiosender BBC eine Serie von Hörspielen (Radio Plays), eine Gattung, die in Frankreich damals kaum bekannt war und mit der sich Beckett ein für ihn neues Feld erschloss. 1957/58 verfasste er den Roman From an Abandoned Work, 1958 das hörspielartige Stück Krapp’s Last Tape (1961 von Marcel Mihalovici in Bielefeld als Oper inszeniert). 1960 schrieb er den französischen Roman Comment c'est und das englische Stück Happy Days (Uraufführung 1961 in New York), das er 1962 als Oh les beaux jours ins Französische übertrug (Uraufführung 1963 in Venedig). 1961 wurde Beckett erstmals mit einem Literaturpreis ausgezeichnet, dem Prix international des éditeurs. 1963 verfasste er neben den Hörspielen Words and Music und Cascando den Einakter Play. Im selben Jahr wurde unter Mitwirkung des Autors das Hörspiel All that fall als Tous ceux qui tombent für das französische Fernsehen adaptiert und gesendet. Hiermit war Beckett in der professionellen Welt der Bilder angekommen, die ihn schon immer interessiert hatte. 1964 konzipierte und drehte er in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Regisseur Alan Schneider (der 1961 schon den Godot verfilmt hatte) den stummfilmartigen Streifen Film, dessen Hauptrolle der Stummfilmstar Buster Keaton spielte und der im Jahr darauf in Venedig den „Prix de la Jeune Critique“ erhielt. Film blieb jedoch der letzte originäre Film Becketts, denn 1965 wendete er sich dem Medium Fernsehen zu und verfasste als sein erstes genuines Fernsehstück Dis Joe, das er der BBC anbot. Da sich die Produktion dort verzögerte, das Stück aber inzwischen ins Deutsche übertragen worden war, entschloss sich der Süddeutsche Rundfunk, es unter der Regie des Autors zu produzieren. Es wurde 1966, an dessen 60. Geburtstag, gesendet und öffnete ihm die Tore des SDR, der bis 1985 noch mehrere Stücke von und mit ihm produzierte. 1967 versuchte Beckett sich in Berlin als Theaterregisseur mit seinem Stück Endspiel (Fin de partie) von 1956. Im Jahr 1968 erschien unter dem Titel Comédie et actes divers ein Sammelband französisch verfasster bzw. ins Französische übertragener Stücke. Spätestens ab dem Ende der fünfziger Jahre war Beckett ein anerkannter Autor. Seine Texte wurden rasch zum Druck angenommen und seine Stücke umgehend aufgeführt oder produziert. Er figurierte sogar, obwohl von Natur aus eher scheu und notorisch depressiv, ein wenig als Star im Pariser Literaturbetrieb. 1969 erhielt er den Nobelpreis für Literatur, blieb der Überreichungszeremonie jedoch fern. 1968 war er zum auswärtigen Ehrenmitglied der American Academy of Arts and Sciences ernannt worden. 1970 verfasste Beckett die Erzählung Le Dépeupleur (Der Verwaiser), 1977 erschienen mit Fizzles acht kurze Prosastücke. Jasper Johns schuf hierzu in enger Zusammenarbeit mit Beckett Grafiken und Buchgestaltungen. 1978 erschien die Verssammlung Mirlitonnades, ein Werk der „Einfachheit mit doppeltem Boden“. Es folgten zahlreiche weitere kürzere Texte, die hin und wieder gesammelt bei den Éditions de Minuit erschienen. Allerdings zog Beckett sich als Person mehr und mehr zurück und verschwand auch als Autor langsam aus dem Bewusstsein der Öffentlichkeit. Samuel Beckett starb am 22. Dezember 1989 im Alter von 83 Jahren. Seine letzte Ruhestätte befindet sich auf dem Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. Nachwirkung Becketts Ruhm beruht vor allem auf Warten auf Godot, dessen zwei zentrale Figuren eine menschliche Grundsituation zu verkörpern scheinen: das Hoffen auf eine vermeintlich nahe Erfüllung oder Erlöserfigur. Der ausweglose Dauerzustand des Wartens und die Nonsense-Dialoge der beiden Hauptfiguren verdeutlichen dabei in paradigmatischer Weise die Merkmale des absurden Theaters, das die existentialistische Sichtweise der Sinnlosigkeit der Welt, der Fragwürdigkeit der Sprache und der Selbstentfremdung des Menschen konsequent in die dramatische Form umsetzt. Das Rätsel Godot hat auch in Deutschland zu zahllosen Deutungen geführt, u. a. von Günther Anders in seinem Werk „Die Antiquiertheit des Menschen“. Laut Le Monde vom 21. Dezember 2007 hält Beckett zurzeit, wenn auch mit einigem Abstand hinter Eugène Ionesco, Platz 2 auf der Liste der französischen Theaterautoren, die außerhalb Frankreichs am meisten gespielt werden. Der Komparatist Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht interpretiert das Stück Warten auf Godot zeithistorisch: Dieser Text ... hat für mich all die Motive absorbiert, die für mich entscheidend in der Darstellung der unmittelbaren Nachkriegszeit sind. Emblematisch sind die letzten Worte in „Godot“, als die beiden Protagonisten sagen: „Zieh dir die Hose hoch,“ und „wir gehen jetzt weg.“ Beckett sagt: „Sie laufen, aber sie legen keinen Weg zurück“. Und das scheint mir die kompakteste denkbare Zusammenfassung der Nachkriegsgeschichte zu sein. ... das beständige Warten, das Offensein für die Ankunft von etwas, was sich im Leben meiner Generation nie eingestellt hat. |
G;|Sir Isaiah Berlin (* 6. Juni 1909 in Riga, Russisches Kaiserreich; † 5. November 1997 in Oxford) war ein russisch-britischer politischer Philosoph und Ideengeschichtler jüdischer Abstammung. Berlin war seit Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts vor allem durch seine Unterscheidung zwischen negativer und positiver Freiheit bekannt geworden. Seit den 1980er und 1990er Jahren konzentriert sich das Interesse an ihm dann vor allem auf sein Konzept eines Wertepluralismus im Verhältnis zum Liberalismus. Zusammen mit dem US-amerikanischen Philosophen John Rawls war er der einflussreichste Denker des Liberalismus nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg. Berlin wurde durch die russische Februarrevolution und die Oktoberrevolution geprägt, die er beide in Petrograd miterlebte: sie begründeten seinen tiefen Skeptizismus gegen Gewalt und dogmatischen Idealismus als Mittel zur Erlangung politischer Ziele. Ein späterer Besuch in Leningrad 1945 überzeugte ihn von der Unmenschlichkeit des sowjetischen Systems. Intellektuell prägte ihn der in Oxford in seiner Jugend vorherrschende vom Wiener Kreis beeinflusste logische Empirismus (Alfred Jules Ayer), von dem er sich aber bald abwandte. Denker, auf die er sich oft bezog, waren Alexander Herzen, John Stuart Mill und Immanuel Kant. Berlin beschäftigte sich eingehend mit den häufig romantisch beeinflussten Gegnern der Aufklärung, deren meist vorhandenen Monismus er ablehnte; jedoch schätzte er sie – sich selbst eher zu den Aufklärern zählend – als wichtige Kritiker von Schwachpunkten der Aufklärungsdoktrin.  Riga, Petrograd, Riga Berlin wurde als Sohn einer reichen Holzhändlerfamilie in der damals russischen Stadt Riga geboren. Er war ein Einzelkind, das geboren wurde, als seinen Eltern bereits ärztlich attestiert worden war, sie könnten keine Kinder mehr bekommen. Er selbst sagte, er sei in seiner Kindheit hemmungslos verwöhnt worden. Die Familie war aufgrund ihrer wirtschaftlichen Bedeutung von sämtlichen diskriminierenden Gesetzen, denen Juden im zaristischen Russland unterworfen waren, ausgenommen. Die vorwiegende Umgangssprache in seinem Elternhaus war Russisch, Deutsch wurde aber auch gesprochen. Als Berlin fünf Jahre alt war, brach der Erste Weltkrieg aus. Die Lage für die Juden in Riga wurde zunehmend schwierig. Sie selbst orientierten sich kulturell nach Deutschland, waren aber zudem russische Staatsbürger, während der aufstrebende lettische Nationalismus antisemitische Züge trug. Als ein Großteil des gelagerten Holzes in Mendel Berlins Lager verbrannte, beschuldigte dieser den deutschen Eigentümer des Lagergeländes der Sabotage. Der Deutsche zeigte daraufhin Mendel Berlin umgehend wegen Versicherungsbetruges an: Berlin habe das Lager selbst in Brand gesteckt. Die Familie verließ die Stadt auch wegen der herannahenden Front und zog über Umwege nach Petrograd. In der damaligen russischen Hauptstadt erlebte Berlin die Februar- und Oktoberrevolution. Obwohl das Unternehmen seines Vaters den Umbruch wirtschaftlich gut überlebte und Mendel Berlin zudem Angestellter in der Holzbeschaffung für die russische Eisenbahn wurde, waren häufige Besuche der Geheimpolizei an der Tagesordnung. Nach Berlins Aussage brauchte sein Vater auch nach dem Umzug nach England noch ein Jahr, um nicht beim Geräusch eines Fahrzeugs, das in der Nähe des Hauses hielt, angstvoll aus dem Fenster zu spähen und sich zu vergewissern, dass es nicht zur Geheimpolizei gehörte. Die Berlins zogen zurück nach Riga, wo sie sich im inzwischen unabhängigen Lettland sicherer vor Verfolgung wähnten. Dort allerdings wurden sie Opfer antisemitischer Schikanen durch einzelne Verwaltungsbehörden. Bereits auf dem Weg nach Riga mussten die Berlins jeden Verwaltungsakt, der ethnischen Letten selbstverständlich offen stand, mit Schmiergeldern bezahlen. Schließlich beschlossen sie, nach London zu ziehen, wo Mendel Berlin noch aus der Vorkriegszeit umfangreiche geschäftliche Verbindungen besaß. Berlin besuchte in Russland keine Schule regelmäßig. Bis zum Umzug nach England bildete er sich größtenteils durch intensive Benutzung der Bibliotheken von Eltern und Verwandten. London und Oxford 1919 traf die Familie in London ein. Aufgrund seiner geschäftlichen Kontakte in London hatte Mendel Berlin Zugriff auf Geldmittel im Land und konnte in kurzer Zeit sein Geschäft wieder aufbauen. Isaiah identifizierte sich mit den Werten der britischen Gesellschaft. Großbritannien wurde für ihn zum Sinnbild für Zivilisation und Toleranz. 1932 wurde Berlin der erste jüdische Fellow des All Souls College der Oxford University. An der Universität Oxford arbeiteten damals nur drei Juden. Innerhalb der britischen jüdischen Gemeinschaft sorgte dies für Aufsehen. Er hatte danach regelmäßig Umgang mit den gesellschaftlichen Eliten der Gemeinschaft. Gleich nach seiner Ernennung lud ihn Baron Rothschild auf ein Wochenende ein. Seine erste Veröffentlichung war ein Buch über die politischen und philosophischen Ideen von Karl Marx. Es enthielt auch biographische Elemente. Positiv, aber ohne großen Enthusiasmus aufgenommen, attestierte ihm selbst der kommunistische Daily Worker, dass es immerhin kenntnisreicher geschrieben sei als die üblichen bourgeoisen Verleumdungen. Das Werk sollte die einzige Monographie bleiben, die Berlin je veröffentlichte. New York und Washington, D.C. Am 9. Juli 1940 unternahm Berlin zusammen mit Guy Burgess eine Schiffsreise in die USA, um von dort weiter an die britische Botschaft in Moskau zu gehen. Burgess arbeitete zu dieser Zeit – was Berlin nicht wusste – als einer der Cambridge Five als sowjetischer Spion. Burgess wollte als Begleiter von Berlin unauffällig nach Moskau gelangen. Allerdings war der Plan schlecht vorbereitet; die britische Botschaft in Moskau wusste weder von Berlins Ankunft, noch hieß sie sie gut. Für Berlin war in New York City das Ende der Reise erreicht. Dort überraschte ihn der Beginn der Luftschlacht um England. Hatte er eigentlich nach Moskau gehen wollen, um dort zum Kampf gegen Deutschland beitragen zu können, so sah sich plötzlich isoliert im sicheren Amerika, während auf seine Heimat Bomben fielen. Ein Angebot im Auftrag des britischen Informationsministeriums, die US-Zeitungen auszuwerten, wollte er erst ablehnen, nahm es aber letzten Endes – nachdem er von Oktober 1940 bis Januar 1941 nach Hause zurückgekehrt war – an, um sich nicht selbst als Feigling sehen zu müssen. Von Washington aus schrieb Berlin Berichte über die politische Stimmung in den USA für die britische Botschaft, die bis zu Winston Churchill gelangten. Die ungewöhnlich kenntnisreichen Berichte machten Berlins Namen in der gesamten britischen Regierung bekannt. Aufgrund seines Konversationstalents und seiner Affinität zu Partys und gesellschaftlichen Ereignissen war Berlin wahrscheinlich der über Klatsch und informelle Beziehungen in der US-Hauptstadt bestinformierte Brite jener Zeit. Seine Berichte schrieb er in zwei Versionen: einer offiziellen, die den Amtsweg ging, und einer inoffiziellen mit den pikanteren Details, die über Freunde unter der Hand in London verteilt wurden. Öffentliche Bekanntheit: Churchills Verwechslung Einer breiteren Öffentlichkeit wurde er durch einen Zufall bekannt. Während des Krieges hielt sich der US-amerikanische Komponist Irving Berlin, der Verfasser des populären Liedes White Christmas, zeitweise in London auf. Winston Churchill, der Irving mit Isaiah verwechselte, lud irrtümlich den Komponisten zu einem Dinner ein. Während des Dinners verwirrten Irving Berlin die detaillierten Fragen sehr, die Churchill ihm zur US-Innenpolitik stellte, während diesen die vagen und unbestimmten Antworten seines Gastes verwunderten. Selbst als der US-Amerikaner bekannt gab, wie er bei der nächsten US-Wahl wählen wolle, entdeckte keiner der Anwesenden das Missverständnis; Churchill murmelte nur etwas über das gute englisch-amerikanische Verhältnis, demzufolge jetzt selbst ein britischer Oxford-Professor in den USA wählen dürfte. Aufgeklärt wurde die Verwechslung erst nach dem Dinner. Die Geschichte gelangte 1949 an die britischen Zeitungen, von denen sie freudig publiziert wurde. Der Name Isaiah Berlin wurde damit zum ersten Mal ein Begriff in der britischen Öffentlichkeit. Moskau und Leningrad Berlin hatte sich stets mit russischer Literatur und den geistigen Strömungen im Land seiner Herkunft beschäftigt. Direkt nach seiner Ankunft gelangte er seinem Naturell entsprechend auf einen Empfang der britischen Botschaft, wo er Sergei Eisenstein kennenlernte. Er ging oft ins Theater, war fasziniert von den Gesprächen und Erfahrungen, die er dort machte. Er sprach von „Emotionen und Ausdrücken, von denen ich lange vergessen habe, dass sie überhaupt existieren“. Insbesondere traf er in Russland die Dichter Boris Pasternak in Moskau und Anna Achmatowa in Leningrad. Er sah ihnen sowohl das physische Elend, in dem sie lebten, als auch ihr Leiden unter der Enge und geistigen Rigidität des stalinschen Systems an. Beide hatten in den Jahrzehnten zuvor enge Freunde – in Achmatowas Fall die Männer, die sie liebte – durch die Säuberungspolitik verloren, beide hielten aber unter großer Anstrengung ihre Würde aufrecht und wurden dadurch in der Sowjetunion zu Symbolen des Widerstands. Die Treffen und Gespräche mit ihnen prägten Berlin tief und waren mit Ausschlag gebend für seine Ablehnung der Sowjetunion und totalitärer Systeme generell. Der eher kleine und dickliche Mann war berühmt für seine Empathie und sein Konversationstalent. Innerhalb kurzer Zeit erwarb er an jedem Ort, an dem er sich aufhielt, einen großen und imposanten Bekanntenkreis. Offiziell war Berlin in dieser Zeit Erster Sekretär der britischen Botschaft in Moskau. Leningrad: Treffen mit Anna Achmatowa Nach seiner eigenen Aussage reiste Berlin nach Leningrad, um seine Kindheitserinnerungen aufzufrischen, vor allem aber, weil es dort zu dieser Zeit eine größere Auswahl an klassischer russischer Literatur zu billigeren Preisen gab. Die literarische Szene selbst war durch den Eisernen Vorhang bereits isoliert. Selbst ausgewiesene Experten wie Berlin und sein Briefpartner Maurice Bowra konnten nur darüber spekulieren, ob einzelne Autoren noch lebten, geschweige denn, ob und was sie schrieben. Über die in einem Buchladen am Newski-Prospekt frisch erworbene Bekanntschaft zum Literaturkritiker Orlow stellte Berlin Kontakt zu Anna Achmatowa her: Er wollte eigentlich nur wissen, ob sie überhaupt noch lebte und wurde prompt eingeladen. Vor der Kulisse eines halb verfallenen Palastes, in dem Achmatowa ein Zimmer in Armut bewohnte, traf sich eine eher kleine und dickliche, fast virile 34-jährige „Jungfrau“ mit einer 57-Jährigen, die in ihrer Jugend eine der gefürchtetsten Femmes fatales Russlands gewesen war; ihr Beziehungsleben hatte die gesamte Gerüchteküche der Metropole Sankt Petersburgs beschäftigt. Das Treffen dauerte nur eine Nacht, prägte aber das Leben beider. Oxford Die Jahre zwischen 1955 und 1962 waren die produktivsten des akademischen Lebens von Berlin. Er schrieb in dieser Zeit die meisten seiner später veröffentlichten Texte. Seine Antrittsvorlesung als Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory über Negative Freiheit und Positive Freiheit sollte sich als bahnbrechend erweisen. Der russisch-baltische Jude galt in Oxford als Inbegriff des britischen Intellektuellen. Zeitgenossen beschreiben sein Wissen als enzyklopädisch und extrem vielseitig. Vor den Hörsälen, in denen er las, bildeten sich oft Schlangen von Studenten, die ihn reden hören wollten. In seiner Konversation galt er als geistreich, subtil und äußerst lebendig. Geradezu berüchtigt war sein sehr schneller Redestil, oder wie der Konservative Abgeordnete für Oxford und zeitweilige Fellow am Nuffield-College, Oxford Christopher Montague Woodhouse es 1982 ausdrückte: “He was known as the only man in Oxford who could pronounce ’epistemological’ as one syllable.” (dt: „Er war als einziger Mensch in Oxford bekannt, der epistemologisch in einer einzigen Silbe aussprechen konnte.“) Die Aura des Intellektuellen umgab ihn, der Times-Journalist Richard Morrison schrieb 2002 rückblickend: “As a schoolboy in NW3, I would be sent on cross-country runs over Hampstead Heath, where I might encounter Michael Foot walking his dog or Isaiah Berlin walking his brain.” (dt: „Als Schuljunge im [Londoner Bezirk] NW3 musste ich quer über den Hampstead Heath Querfeldeinläufe machen. Dort konnte ich den britischen Politiker Michael Foot treffen, der seinen Hund, oder Isaiah Berlin, der sein Gehirn ausführte.“) Fritz Stern erinnert sich an ein Treffen mit Berlin in Jerusalem 1979: „Isaiah Berlin hatte mich gebeten, in sein Hotel zu kommen und dort unsere Gespräche fortzusetzen. Isaiah war ein Wunder: Die Klarheit und Schnelligkeit, mit der er dachte und sprach, die sprudelnde Fülle seiner Ideen, die Aperçus über menschliche und historische Schwächen! Mit ihm zu sprechen, war, als tränke man Champagner.“ Im Jahre 1957 erhielt Berlin den Order of Merit. Später gründete er das Wolfson College in Oxford; er war damit einer der wenigen Philosophen des 20. Jahrhunderts, denen es gelang, ihre Philosophie in einer akademischen Institution zu verankern. 1959 wurde Berlin in die American Academy of Arts and Sciences gewählt. Späte akademische Anerkennung: Bücher Obwohl Professor in Oxford und durch Vorträge auf BBC Radio 4 vielen Briten als politischer Philosoph bekannt, setzte sein Ruhm innerhalb der akademischen Wissenschaften spät ein. Berlin hatte zwar zeit seines akademischen Lebens publiziert, allerdings waren seine Aufsätze über Dutzende Journale, Festschriften, Aufsatzsammlungen, Konferenzberichte etc. verteilt oder lagen nur als unveröffentlichte Vortrags- und Vorlesungsmanuskripte vor. Neben seiner Marx-Monographie existierten zu dieser Zeit nur sein Buch über Vico und Herder sowie die bahnbrechenden Four Essays on Liberty. Zu einem Großteil waren sie schon zu Berlins Lebzeiten in den Archiven verschwunden, selbst Berlin konnte sich in den 1970ern an viele seiner Texte nicht mehr erinnern, geschweige denn daran, wo sie veröffentlicht waren. Selbst akademische Kreise kannten ihn vor allem aus dem Radio oder bezeichneten ihn als Salonvirtuosen ohne wissenschaftliche Leistungen. Das änderte sich erst 1974 als sich Henry Hardy, ein Absolvent des Wolfson College, an Berlin wandte. Er schlug vor, seine Texte zu sammeln und in Buchform neu zu publizieren. Er sammelte Berlins verstreute Aufsätze, unfertige Manuskripte und Vorlesungsaufzeichnungen. Erst danach erkannte ihn auch die Wissenschaft als einen der wichtigsten politischen Philosophen des 20. Jahrhunderts an. Der oft unsauber zitierende und die harte Arbeit einer Publikation scheuende Berlin geriet so an einen methodischen, oft auch pedantischen, Herausgeber, der sich unermüdlich durch Archive wühlte, um auch das entlegenste Zitat zu überprüfen. Im Laufe ihrer 23-jährigen Zusammenarbeit erschienen zahlreiche Bücher, Hardy hatte in kurzer Zeit auch eine Bibliographie mit über 100 Artikeln zusammengestellt. Vielen, wahrscheinlich auch Berlin selbst, wurde damit erstmals der rote Faden seines Werkes ebenso deutlich wie seine einzigartige Stellung durch seine historisch-politisch-moralischen Untersuchungen, die sich der Spezialisierung des Wissenschaftsbetriebs widersetzten. Ab 1974 war er Präsident der British Academy. Gegen Ende der 1970er war er Großbritanniens bekanntester Intellektueller. Er wurde regelmäßig von der britischen Königin in den Buckingham Palace oder von Margaret Thatcher nach Downing Street eingeladen, wenn ein israelischer Gast anwesend war oder jemand aufgrund seiner intellektuellen Leistungen geehrt wurde. Er traf dort auch Michail Gorbatschow. 1983 bekam er den Erasmuspreis für Verdienste um die europäische Kultur (100.000 Niederländische Gulden). 1988, als sein baldiger Tod absehbar war, reiste er noch einmal nach Moskau und Sankt Petersburg. Dabei besuchte er auch das Fontänen-Haus, den Ort seines Treffens mit Anna Achmatowa. Nach seinem Tod wurden Gedenkveranstaltungen in Oxford, London, Washington DC und Jerusalem durchgeführt. Berlin war neben seinen inhaltlichen Texten auch für seinen einerseits lebendigen und mitfühlenden, stets aber auch skeptischen Stil bekannt. Selbst bei Menschen, deren Leistungen er offensichtlich verehrte, konnte er die dunklen Flecken im Werk, Unfertiges oder Beschränktheiten des Horizonts aufzeigen. |
G;|Johan August Strindberg [ˌoːgɵst ˈstrindbærʝ] (* 22. Januar 1849 in Stockholm; † 14. Mai 1912 in Stockholm) war ein schwedischer Schriftsteller und Künstler. Er gilt als einer der wichtigsten schwedischen Autoren, besonders seine Dramatik ist weltbekannt. Von den 1870er Jahren bis zu seinem Tod dominierte er das literarische Schweden, war ständig umstritten und oft in persönliche Konflikte verwickelt. Zu seinem umfangreichen literarischen Werk gehören Romane, Novellen und Dramen, die zu den Klassikern schwedischer Literatur zählen.  Kindheit und Jugend Johan August Strindberg kam in Stockholm als viertes von insgesamt acht Kindern des Dampfschiffkommissionärs Carl Oscar Strindberg und der früheren Haushaltsangestellten und zwölf Jahre jüngeren Ulrika Eleonora (Nora) Norling zur Welt. Strindbergs Tante väterlicherseits, Lisette Strindberg, war die Ehefrau des Dampfschiffpioniers Samuel Owen. Die Familie führte ein mittelständisches Leben. Aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen Schwankungen der väterlichen Schiffsagentur war sie zu zahlreichen Wohnungswechseln genötigt. Strindberg zog innerhalb der 20 Jahre, die er gemeinsam mit der Familie lebte, zehnmal um. Bildung und Kunst wurden im Elternhaus gepflegt, wenn auch in bescheidenem Maße. Der Vater spielte Klavier und Cello und es fanden regelmäßig Hausmusikabende statt. Auch mit dem Theater kam die Familie in Berührung – der Neffe Ludvig Strindberg war Schauspieler und kam häufig zu Besuch. Strindbergs künstlerische Interessen wurden jedoch erst einige Zeit später geweckt. In der Kindheit beherrschte er als einziger der Familie kein Instrument. Strindberg wird als schüchternes, verschlossenes Kind beschrieben, das sich schon früh für die Naturwissenschaft interessierte. Zeit seines Lebens achtete er auf gute Kleidung. Seine Ansichten über Ehe und Familie galten als ähnlich streng wie die seines Vaters. Seine Mutter beschreibt er später in Tjänstekvinnans son (1886–1909, Der Sohn einer Magd) als freundliche, aber auch sehr sensible Frau. 1853 ging das Unternehmen des Vaters in Konkurs, konnte sich jedoch sehr schnell erholen. Im Jahr 1856 zog die Familie aus dem Klaraviertel in den ländlichen Norden von Stockholm, später noch weiter aufs Land. Strindberg ging anfangs weiter in die streng geführte und nun recht weit entfernte Klaraschule. 1860 dann kam er auf die näher gelegene Jakobschule, wo er nach eigener Schilderung zum ersten Mal ein Bewusstsein für soziale Unterschiede bekam. Ab 1861 besuchte Strindberg das private Stockholmer Lyceum – ein liberal geführtes Gymnasium. Für Naturkunde und vor allem für Französisch konnte er sich besonders begeistern. Im Jahr 1862 starb Strindbergs Mutter an Tuberkulose. Das schwierige Verhältnis zum Vater besserte sich in der Zeit der Trauer nur kurzfristig. Mit der erneuten Heirat des Vaters – er ehelichte die 22-jährige Erzieherin der Kinder Emma Charlotta Petterson – und der Geburt des gemeinsamen Sohnes Emil wurden die familiären Beziehungen zunehmend angespannter. Strindbergs Pubertät gestaltete sich folglich ausgesprochen schwierig. Er zog sich in den Pietismus zurück, mit dem er durch seine Mutter erstmals in Berührung gekommen war, und übte sich in religiöser Enthaltsamkeit. Der Weg zum Schriftsteller Im Mai 1867 legte Strindberg sein Abitur ab und immatrikulierte sich in Uppsala für das Studium der „Ästhetik und lebenden Sprachen“. Neben Versuchen, sich als Scharfschütze und Prediger Geld zu verdienen, war er vor allem als Grundschul- und Hauslehrer tätig. Zudem nahm er bald darauf ein Medizinstudium auf, brach die Studien jedoch 1869 ab, um sich an einer Karriere als Schauspieler zu versuchen. Aufgrund mangelnden Erfolgs entschied er sich 1870, das Studium in Uppsala fortzusetzen. Während seiner Studienzeit begann Strindberg mit dem Schreiben. Nach zwei Jahren zwang ihn seine finanzielle Situation, das Studium endgültig abzubrechen und in die Hauptstadt zurückzukehren, wo er als Journalist unterzukommen versuchte. Die erste Fassung von Mäster Olof (Meister Olof) entstand in dieser Zeit. 1873 arbeitete er als Redakteur bei der schwedischen Tageszeitung Dagens Nyheter. Ein Jahr später bekam er bei der Königlichen Bibliothek eine Anstellung als Sekretär, die bis 1882 bestand. Strindbergs literarischer Durchbruch kam 1879 mit der Herausgabe von Röda rummet (Das rote Zimmer), einem satirischen Gesellschaftsroman, und der Aufführung von Meister Olof (über den schwedischen Reformator Olaus Petri). Ehe mit Siri von Essen 1877 heiratete Strindberg die Finnlandschwedin Siri von Essen, eine Schauspielerin des Königlichen Theaters. Mit ihr hatte er drei Kinder, die beiden Töchter Karin (* 1880) und Greta (* 1881) und den Sohn Hans (* 1884). Während der folgenden Jahre schrieb er das historische Werk Svenska folket (Das schwedische Volk) und den Roman Det nya riket (Das neue Reich). Diese Werke waren in einem realistischen Stil geschrieben und kritisierten im Prinzip sämtliche gesellschaftlichen Institutionen. Infolge der scharfen Kritiken in Schweden sah sich Strindberg 1883 genötigt, das Land zu verlassen, um sich in Frankreich niederzulassen. Zusammen mit Siri und den Kindern schloss er sich der skandinavischen Künstlerkolonie im französischen Grez-sur-Loing an. Anklage wegen Gotteslästerung 1884 wurde die Novellensammlung Giftas (Heiraten) veröffentlicht. Der erste Teil der Dygdens lön (Lohn der Tugend) führte zu einer Anklage wegen „Gotteslästerung und Verspottung der Heiligen Schrift und der Sakramente“. Der Prozess wird auf Schwedisch Giftasprocessen genannt. In der Geschichte erzählte Strindberg von den Folgen falscher Erziehung und religiöser Verkrampfung, insbesondere die Darstellung der Konfirmation als „erschütternder Akt“, „durch den die Oberklasse auf Christi Leib und Wort der Unterklasse den Eid abnimmt, dass diese sich nicht darum kümmern werde, was jene tut“, provozierte die Anklage. Strindberg, zu diesem Zeitpunkt in Genf lebend, musste in Stockholm vor Gericht erscheinen. Bei seiner Ankunft wurden Kundgebungen veranstaltet, eine Festaufführung von Glückspeters Reise wurde mit großem Erfolg gezeigt. Arbeiterorganisationen und Akademiker sprachen sich für den Schriftsteller aus. Letzten Endes sprach das Gericht Strindberg frei, woraufhin er in die Schweiz zurückkehrte. Trotz des Freispruchs blieb die Anklage jedoch nicht ohne negative Folgen für ihn. In Schweden verlor man das Interesse an Strindberg, der sich nun vorläufig von seinem Heimatland abwendete. Andere Werke machten Strindberg darüber hinaus in ganz Europa als „Frauenfeind“ bekannt. Während des Auslandsaufenthalts fuhr Strindberg fort, autobiografische Romane zu schreiben und zu publizieren, u. a. Der Sohn einer Magd und En dåres försvarstal (1895, Die Beichte eines Toren), Theaterstücke wie Fadren (1887, Der Vater) und Fröken Julie (1889, Fräulein Julie), sowie gesellschaftskritische Romane wie Utopier i verkligheten (1885, Utopien in der Wirklichkeit). Auf einer Reise nach Kopenhagen zur Aufführung von Der Vater lernte er Georg Brandes kennen, der ihm den Briefkontakt zu Friedrich Nietzsche vermittelte. Bis Ende 1889 blieb er im Ausland und kehrte schließlich nach Stockholm zurück. Seine Ehe mit Siri von Essen war in dieser Zeit immer angespannter geworden, was sich auch in den Frauenporträts in seinen Romanen niederschlug. August und Siri ließen sich 1891 scheiden. Der Aufbruch war von einer künstlerischen Krise begleitet. 1892 zog Strindberg nach Berlin, wo er unter anderem auf Edvard Munch und Ola Hansson traf. Dabei spielte das Weinlokal „Zum schwarzen Ferkel“ eine zentrale Rolle. Es wurde zum Treffpunkt einer internationalen Künstler-Bohème. Kurze Ehe mit Frida Uhl Anfang 1893 lernte Strindberg die zwanzigjährige Journalistin Maria Friederike (Frida) Uhl aus Österreich kennen. Wenige Monate später nahm er sie auf Helgoland zur Frau. 1894 wurde Tochter Kerstin geboren. Zahlreiche Auseinandersetzungen und Streitereien begleiteten die Beziehung, so dass es noch im selben Jahr zum endgültigen Bruch zwischen Strindberg und Uhl kam. Erst 1897 wurde die Ehe rechtskräftig geschieden. Strindberg hielt sich von 1893 bis 1896 zeitweise mit seiner Familie in Österreich auf und wohnte ab 1893 im Schloss Dornach in der Gemeinde Saxen. Später zog er mit seiner schwangeren Frau vom Schloss in das sogenannte Häusl, wo im Mai 1894 seine Tochter Kerstin zur Welt kam. Während familiärer Streitigkeiten verließ Strindberg Dornach und wohnte vorübergehend in Klam im Rosenzimmer, einem Eckzimmer beim Kirchenwirt. Der Klamer Ortsteil auf der Bergkuppe wurde Strindberg genannt. Auf dem Kellerstöckl des Hauses im Park vis-à-vis ist eine Erinnerungstafel angebracht. Das Strindbergmuseum Saxen ist das einzige Museum außerhalb Schwedens, das dem Autor gewidmet ist, und beschäftigt sich mit dessen Aufenthalt in der Gegend und den im Zusammenhang damit entstandenen Werken. Zu sehen sind unter anderem eine Reihe von Originalbriefen und -manuskripten, zeitgenössische Fotos und das seinerzeit von ihm angekaufte Klavier. Der Kulturwanderweg Strindbergweg- Klamschlucht führt von Saxen nach Klam. Der Weg führt vorbei an einem romantischen Wasserfall, der dem Autor, der sich auch als Maler betätigte, als Vorbild für eines seiner Bilder diente. Weitere Motive fanden Eingang in seine Romane, wie etwa die Hammerschmiede, der Leostein, die Bergmayr-Mühle und der Saustall. Inferno-Krise (1895–1897) Nach der Ehe mit Frida Uhl durchlebte Strindberg eine ausgesprochen düstere Phase seines Lebens, in der er unter Wahnvorstellungen, Realitätsverlust und Depressionen litt. Sie wird „Inferno-Krise“ genannt, da Strindberg die Erfahrungen dieser Zeit vor allem in dem Roman Inferno, Legender (1897, Inferno. Legenden) in Form von autobiografischen, teilweise verklärten Aufzeichnungen verarbeitete. Es ist auch die Zeit, in der Strindberg begann, wissenschaftliche und alchemistische Versuche zu machen. In gewisser Weise gelang es ihm, sich „frei zu schreiben“ und so seine psychische Krise zu überwinden. In den folgenden sechs Jahren schrieb er mehr als 25 Stücke. Die produktiven Jahre In der Zeit zwischen 1898 und 1907 fand eine Neuausrichtung in Strindbergs Schreiben statt: von Anarchismus, Realismus und Naturalismus hin zu Mystik, Symbolismus und Okkultismus. Seine in dieser Zeit entstandenen Dramen haben die europäische Theatergeschichte des 20. Jahrhunderts nachhaltig beeinflusst. Zu nennen sind vor allem: Till Damaskus I–III (Nach Damaskus I–III), 1898–1904 Dödsdansen (Der Totentanz), 1901 Ett drömspel (Ein Traumspiel), 1902 Spöksonaten (Gespenstersonate), 1907 In dieser Zeit schrieb Strindberg zudem mehrere von William Shakespeare inspirierte Historiendramen mit Figuren der schwedischen Geschichte: Gustav Vasa (1899), Erik XIV (1899), Karl XII und Gustav Adolf (1900). Mit Svarta fanor (1907, Schwarze Fahnen) verfasste er ein Stück über das Kulturetablissement der Hauptstadt im Allgemeinen und die jüngere Autorengeneration im Besonderen. 1906 entstanden die späten Novellen Takslagsöl (Richtfest) und Syndabocken (Der Sündenbock). 1904 erschien Götiska rummen (Die gotischen Zimmer). Außerdem schreibt er eine Reihe von Kammerspielen (1907): Oväder (Wetterleuchten), Brända tomten (Die Brandstätte) und Pelikanen (Der Pelikan, auf Deutsch auch Der Scheiterhaufen). Zu dieser Reihe gehört auch das schon erwähnte Werk Spöksonaten (Die Gespenstersonate), welches seine „bizarrste Symboldichtung“ darstellt. Strindberg war jetzt ein berühmter Schriftsteller, was nicht verhinderte, dass er finanziell in der Krise war und weiterhin gegen alles und jeden einen Aufstand machte. 1897 beschloss er, sich doch mit seinem Land zu versöhnen, und zog nach Lund. Dort kam er über Bengt Lidforss mit dem Dichter Emil Kléen in Kontakt, einer der wenigen Freunde, mit denen Strindberg befreundet blieb. Im darauffolgenden Jahr zog er nach Östermalm in Stockholm. Dritte Ehe mit Harriet Bosse 1900 lernte Strindberg die junge Künstlerin Harriet Bosse (1878–1961) bei einer Vorstellung des Sommernachtstraums kennen, in der sie die Rolle des Puck spielte. Fasziniert von ihrer exotischen Erscheinung bot er ihr die Rolle der Dame in seinem Drama Nach Damaskus an. Im Anschluss an die Premiere schrieb er begeistert über ihre Darstellung: „Werden Sie jetzt bei uns die Schauspielerin des neuen Jahrhunderts! Sie haben uns neue Töne geschenkt, woher Sie sie auch genommen haben mögen.“ Am 6. Mai 1901 heirateten Strindberg und Bosse. Im Jahr darauf wurde Tochter Anne-Marie geboren († 17. August 2007 als Anne-Marie Hagelin im Alter von 105 Jahren). Die Ehe mit Bosse hielt bis 1904. Grund für die Trennung war nicht zuletzt der große Altersunterschied, verbunden mit unterschiedlichen Vorstellungen vom Zusammenleben. Bosse fühlte sich eingesperrt und glaubte, ihre Ansprüche ans Leben für Strindberg aufgeben zu müssen. Strindberg verkraftete die Trennung nur schwer; er litt unter Halluzinationen und erotischen Wahnvorstellungen und schickte ihr unablässig Briefe. Erst als Bosse 1908 den schwedischen Schauspieler Gunnar Wingård heiratete, kam die Beziehung endgültig zu einem Ende. Im Okkulten Tagebuch verarbeitete Strindberg die Ehe mit Bosse. Das Intime Theater in Stockholm Von besonderer Bedeutung für Strindberg war die Gründung des Intimen Theaters am 26. November 1907 in Stockholm, wo er sich mit Begeisterung als Stifter, Dramaturg und Regisseur einbrachte. Auch schrieb er zahlreiche Stücke eigens für die Bühne des Theaters. Max Reinhardt hatte 1902 mit der Gründung seines „Kleinen Theaters“ das deutsche Vorbild geliefert. Mit einer Serie von Strindberg-Stücken war hier der Durchbruch des Autors in Deutschland gelungen. Die letzten Jahre 1908 zog Strindberg in die Drottninggatan 85, in den sogenannten „Blauen Turm“, wo heute das Strindbergmuseum und der Sitz der Strindberg-Gesellschaft ist. Im „Blauen Turm“ hatte er wieder Kontakt zu Siri und den gemeinsamen Kindern, die er auch finanziell unterstützte. Er begegnete Bernhard Shaw und hatte eine letzte Romanze mit der jungen Künstlerin Fanny Falkner, die er auch als Sekretärin beschäftigte. Während seiner letzten Jahre nahm er die gesellschaftskritische Sparte wieder auf, was eine sehr intensive Debatte auslöste. Strindberg wurde eine Ikone der Arbeiterbewegung, besonders der radikalen Gruppe um die Zeitung Stormklockan und deren Kampf gegen konservative und liberale Stimmen. In seinen letzten Werken, En blå bok (Ein Blaubuch, 1907) und dem Stationendrama Stora landsvägen (Die große Landstraße, 1909), kritisierte Strindberg die Wissenschaft und bezog Stellung für die Religion. Interne Streitigkeiten führten 1911 zur Schließung des Intimen Theaters. Strindberg litt zunehmend unter Krankheitsbeschwerden, denn er war an Magenkrebs erkrankt. Seinen Abschied vom Leben nahm er mit den ergreifenden Worten „Jetzt ist alles Persönliche vernichtet“, worauf er eine Bibel auf die Brust legte. Am 14. Mai 1912 starb Strindberg – kaum einen Monat nach dem Tod seiner ersten Frau Siri von Essen. Er wurde in Stockholm auf dem Nordfriedhof Norra begravningsplatsen (kvarter 13A, Grab Nr. 101) begraben. Der Trauerzug umfasste etwa 60.000 Personen. O crux ave spes unica (O Kreuz, sei gegrüßt, meine einzige Hoffnung) ist auf dem einfachen schwarzen Holzkreuz zu lesen. Vor Strindbergs Ableben hatte der Albert Bonniers Verlag die Rechte an Strindbergs gesammelten Werken gekauft. Karl Otto Bonnier hatte zuerst 150.000 Kronen für Strindbergs Werk geboten (aber ohne ausländische Rechte). Strindberg wies das Gebot ab, nachdem Bonnier 100.000 Kronen für Gustaf Frödings gesammelte Werke (sechs Gedichtsammlungen) bezahlt hatte. Als Bonnier das Gebot auf 200.000 Kronen erhöhte, schlug Strindberg ein. Der Verlag kaufte dann auch die Rechte, die Strindberg an andere verkauft hatte, womit die Gesamtsumme fast 300.000 Kronen betrug. Nach Strindbergs Tod gab der Bonniers Verlag Strindbergs Gesammelte Schriften in 55 Bänden heraus. Während der ersten 20 Jahre nach seinem Tod verkaufte der Verlag 1,7 Mio. Exemplare von Strindbergs Büchern. Zwischen 1912 und 1927 verkaufte der Verlag Bücher von Strindberg für fast 10 Millionen Kronen. |
G;|Johannes Calvin (latinisiert: Ioannes Calvinus, daraus regallizisiert Jean Calvin ([ʒɑ̃ kalvɛ̃]), auch Johan Calvin, eigentlich Jehan Cauvin ([ʒɑ̃ koːvɛ̃]); * 10. Juli 1509 in Noyon, Picardie; † 27. Mai 1564 in Genf) war ein Reformator französischer Abstammung und Begründer des Calvinismus. Er gilt als Vertreter einer kerygmatischen Theologie.  Johannes Calvin war der zweite von vier Söhnen der Eheleute Gerard Cauvin und Jeanne geb. Le Franc. Calvins Vater stammte aus einer Schifferfamilie, hatte es aber bis zum Generalprokurator des Bischofs Charles de Hangest und des Domkapitels von Noyon gebracht. Calvins Mutter war die aus einer flämischen Familie stammende Tochter eines Gastwirts. Besonders die Mutter erzog den kleinen Jean in der römisch-katholischen Frömmigkeit. Sie starb, als er erst fünf Jahre alt war. Calvins Vater sorgte dafür, dass sein Sohn die Lateinschule seiner Heimatstadt Noyon, das Collège des Capettes, besuchte, damit er einmal studieren könnte. Durch den Kontakt des Vaters zu der adligen Familie de Hangest-Montmort hatte er ab 1520 Umgang mit deren gleichaltrigen Söhnen. Er durfte an deren Hausunterricht teilnehmen und lernte so auch adelige Umgangsformen. Calvin erhielt ab 1521 als Pfründe ein Viertel der Einkünfte eines Kaplans an der Kathedrale von Noyon, womit er sein Studium selbst finanzieren konnte. Im Hochsommer 1523 brach er zum Studieren nach Paris auf. Zunächst wohnte er bei seinem Onkel, dem Schlosser und Schmied Richard Cauvin; dann fand er einen Platz im Collège de la Marche. Er begann mit dem Grundstudium, dem Studium der „Sieben freien Künste“ (septem artes liberales): Grammatik, Rhetorik, Dialektik, Arithmetik, Geometrie, Musik und Astronomie. Doch schon nach wenigen Monaten bestimmte das Domkapitel in Noyon, dass er auf das Collège de Montaigu an der Sorbonne wechseln solle. 1528 erwarb er den Titel „Magister artium“. Hiernach forderte sein Vater ihn auf, nicht Theologie, sondern Rechtswissenschaft zu studieren. Inzwischen war nämlich dieser in Streit mit seinem kirchlichen Arbeitgeber über die Verwaltung zweier Erbschaften geraten, in dessen Verlauf der kleine Kirchenbann über ihn verhängt worden war. Calvin ging nach Orléans, 130 km südlich von Paris, um dort Römisches Recht zu studieren. Dort gelang es dem Deutschen Melchior Volmar, Lehrer für Griechisch und Anhänger Luthers, ihn für humanistische Studien zu begeistern. Später wechselte Calvin nach Bourges. Er war ein eifriger Student, der über ein einzigartiges Gedächtnis verfügte und auch nachts las und arbeitete. Dank seines Wissens erwarb er sich grosse Anerkennung bei seinen Professoren und Mitstudenten. Er schloss das Studium als Lizentiat der Rechte ab. Die Fakultät bot ihm die Würde eines Doktors an, die er jedoch ablehnte. Im Frühjahr 1531 verstarb sein Vater. Calvin, der zu dem Sterbenden geeilt war, musste miterleben, wie diesem, der jahrzehntelang im Dienst der Kirche gestanden hatte, die Totenmesse verweigert wurde, weil er im kleinen Kirchenbann war. Anschliessend ging er wieder nach Paris. Er gab die Juristerei auf und wandte sich ganz den im Trend liegenden humanistischen Studien zu. Diese betrieb er an dem 1530 von König Franz I. gegründeten Collège des trois langues (Kolleg der drei Sprachen: Hebräisch, Griechisch, Latein), das als Gegengewicht zu der konservativen, im Geist der Scholastik beharrenden Sorbonne etabliert worden war. Im Haus seines Wohnungsgebers, des reichen Tuchhändlers Étienne de la Forge, der Martin Luthers Gedanken verbreitete, traf sich heimlich ein Kreis „Evangelischer“ Christen. Dazu gehörte auch Gérard Roussel, Prediger am Hof des Königs. Calvin, der an diesen Versammlungen teilnahm, beschäftigte sich mit der reformatorischen Lehre. Im April 1532 veröffentlichte er als erste Frucht seiner humanistischen Studien einen Kommentar zu Senecas De clementia („Über die Milde“), der Kritik an dem grossen Humanisten Erasmus von Rotterdam übte, naturgemäss aber nur für ein kleines Publikum bestimmt war. 1533 führte die Schwester des Königs, Margarete von Navarra, in Paris für mehrere Monate die Regierungsgeschäfte für ihren in Madrid gefangengehaltenen Bruder. Sie stand der evangelischen Lehre nahe. Zu den biblischen Predigten ihres Beichtvaters, des Hofpredigers Gérard Roussel, kamen Tausende. Calvins Freund Nikolaus Kop war zum neuen Rektor der Universität berufen worden. Für Allerheiligen 1533 stand eine Antrittsrede vor den Vertretern der Universität und vor kirchlichen Würdenträgern an. Calvin und sein Freund entwickelten gemeinsam diese Antrittsrede, in der die althergebrachte Scholastik als „Ketzerei“ bezeichnet, die lutherische Lehre als rechtgläubig dargestellt wurde und offen zur Akzeptanz der verfemten Evangelischen aufgerufen wurde. Die Folge war ein Tumult unter den Zuhörern und eine Anzeige gegen Kop beim höchsten Pariser Gericht, dem Parlement. Kop und seine Freunde mussten fliehen. Calvin selbst seilte sich, während die Verfolger schon an die Tür klopften, an zusammengebundenen Leinentüchern aus einem Fenster zum Hof ab. Calvin flüchtete zunächst nach Angoulême zu seinem ehemaligen Mitstudenten Louis du Tillet, der inzwischen Pfarrer und Domherr an der Kathedrale von Angoulême geworden war, und verbarg sich unter dem Decknamen „Charles d’Espeville“. Im April 1534 begab er sich kurz in seine Heimatstadt Noyon, um seine Pfründe offiziell zurückzugeben. Von dort aus ging er an den kleinen Hof Margaretes von Navarra in Nérac. Hier hatten inzwischen auch andere reformatorisch denkende Persönlichkeiten Zuflucht gefunden, so Gérard Roussel sowie der Humanist und Luther-Kenner Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples (alias „Faber Stapulensis“), Übersetzer der lateinischen Bibel (Vulgata) ins Französische und ehedem Mittelpunkt eines reformatorisch gesinnten Kreises in Paris. Als Frucht seines Studiums, vieler Gespräche und tiefen Nachdenkens über das bisher Erlebte bildete sich offenbar während dieser Zeit Calvins bewusste Entscheidung für die Reformation heraus. Zugleich begann er in der Abgeschiedenheit seines Exils mit der Systematisierung seiner Anschauungen und leistete Vorarbeiten für die spätere Institutio. Einerseits war es, wie bei Martin Luther, die Botschaft von der rechtfertigenden Gnade Gottes in Jesus Christus, die auch für ihn eine Befreiung gewesen war. Er selbst sagte später: Andererseits scheute sich Calvin (möglicherweise aus Respekt vor der Institution katholische Kirche), sich von ihr zu trennen. Nachdem sich die Aufregung um die Kop-Affäre gelegt hatte, ging Calvin zurück nach Paris und besuchte den Kreis reformatorisch gesinnter Personen, den er von früher kannte. Auch der spanische Arzt Michael Servetus bat ihn um ein Treffen, erschien dann jedoch selbst nicht. Kaum hatte sich Calvin entschieden der Reformation zugewandt, strömten ihm Menschen zu, die ihn hören wollten. Er reiste umher. In Crotelles teilte er, der kein geweihter Priester und auch kein examinierter Theologe war, zum ersten Mal das Abendmahl aus – und das unter beiderlei Gestalt (Brot und Wein). Am 18. Oktober 1534 wurden überall in Paris sowie am Schlafgemach des Königs, der gerade in Amboise weilte, antikatholische und zugleich lutherkritische Plakate entdeckt: Der König geriet in Zorn und ordnete die Verfolgung der Evangelischen an. Das Parlament führte zahlreiche Ketzerprozesse; bald darauf wurden überall Menschen auf Scheiterhaufen verbrannt, darunter auch Calvins früherer Gastgeber, Étienne de la Forge. Calvin verliess wieder einmal Paris. Mit seinem Freund Louis du Tillet gelangte er nach Strassburg, damals eine Freie Reichsstadt, und wurde dort von Martin Bucer, dem Reformator der Stadt, empfangen. Auf seiner Flucht kam er 1535 ins evangelische Basel. Unter dem Decknamen Martianus Lucianus nahm er sich eine Wohnung. Hier, in Basel, traf er Nikolaus Kop wieder. Bei dem Humanisten Simon Grynäus, einem herausragenden Griechischlehrer der damaligen Zeit, nahm er Unterricht; drei Jahre später widmete er ihm in Dankbarkeit seinen Kommentar zum Römerbrief. Calvin vervollkommnete zur gleichen Zeit seine Fähigkeiten im Hebräischen. Er lernte Heinrich Bullinger und Guillaume Farel kennen und bekam nun auch wieder eine Verbindung zu seinem Vetter Pierre-Robert Olivétan, der die Bibel ins Französische übersetzt hatte (Bible de Genève). Olivetan bat ihn, eine Vorrede zu seiner Bibelübersetzung beizusteuern. Die Vorrede wurde Calvins erste theologische Veröffentlichung. Hauptsächlich arbeitete er jedoch an seiner Institutio Christianae Religionis (dt. „Unterricht in der christlichen Religion“). Dabei war Calvin von der Verfolgung seiner Glaubensgenossen in Frankreich bewegt und wollte darlegen, dass sie mitnichten Ketzer und Aufwiegler seien, sondern seriöse Erneuerer des biblischen Glaubens und der wahren Kirche. Er widmete die Institutio dem französischen König Franz I.. Calvin vollendete die Institutio, die zunächst sechs Kapitel umfasste, am 23. August 1535. Im März 1536 wurde sie dann beim Basler Buchdrucker Thomas Platter gedruckt und veröffentlicht. Bis 1559 wurde die Institutio fortlaufend erweitert, wuchs zu einem als bedeutend geltenden Lehrwerk des christlichen Glaubens im reformatorischen Sinne heran und wurde zunächst ins Französische, dann später in viele andere Sprachen übersetzt. Im Winter 1535/36 zog Calvin nach Ferrara. Die gebildete Herzogin Renata von Ferrara, Schwägerin des französischen Königs, unterstützte seine humanistischen und reformatorischen Bestrebungen. Sie und Calvin blieben dauerhaft freundschaftlich miteinander verbunden. Im Mai 1536 war Calvin wieder in Basel. Die Institutio hatte ihn inzwischen bekannt gemacht. Da König Franz I. die Verfolgung der Evangelischen für beendet erklärt hatte, reiste Calvin noch einmal nach Noyon, ordnete verbliebene Angelegenheiten und trat mit seinem jüngeren Bruder Antoine und seiner aus der zweiten Ehe des Vaters stammenden Stiefschwester Marie die Rückreise an. Um Kriegshandlungen in Savoyen zu umgehen, wollte er über Genf nach Strassburg reisen. Der reformatorische Prediger Guillaume Farel hielt ihn in Genf fest und beschwor ihn, sich dort für die Sache der Reformation einzusetzen. Calvin erarbeitete eine Gemeindeordnung mit strenger Kirchenzucht, die das gesamte öffentliche und private Leben einer minutiösen Regulierung unterwarf und durch äusserst effiziente Überwachungsmassnahmen sowie ein rigides weltliches und geistiges Strafregiment selbst bei geringfügigen Verstössen eine Atmosphäre der Denunziation und Angst verbreitete, in der es keinerlei individuellen Spielraum mehr gab. Im Kern ging es um die Verpflichtung zur regelmässigen Beteiligung an Gottesdienst und Predigt sowie um die Unterdrückung sämtlicher privater Vergnügungen und Neigungen. Sie stiess zunächst auf heftige Widerstände. 1538 wurden er und Farel aus Genf verwiesen, da sie der gesamten Gemeinde das Abendmahl versagten. Dies war eine Protestaktion der beiden als Reaktion auf die Tatsache, dass der Genfer Rat einige Rituale und Bräuche wie zum Beispiel die Verwendung des Taufbeckens oder der Hostie bei der Abendmahlsfeier einführen wollte, um damit der verbündeten Stadt Bern zu gefallen. Infolge der Ausweisung aus Genf kam Calvin 1538 nach Strassburg, wo er eine biblische Professur innehatte und die französische Flüchtlingsgemeinde betreute. Durch Kontakt mit dem dort ansässigen Martin Bucer wurde Calvin in seiner Theologie geprägt, beispielsweise in der Prädestinationslehre, im Abendmahlsverständnis und in der Vierämterlehre. Calvin predigte und hielt Gottesdienste in den Kirchen St. Nikolaus, St. Magdalena und der Dominikanerkirche ab. Um jedoch die kirchliche und politische Ordnung zu stabilisieren, bat der Rat der Stadt Calvin 1540 um seine Rückkehr in die Stadt. In längeren Verhandlungen setzte Calvin Zugeständnisse für seine Rückkehr durch, unter anderem die Zusage, eine Kirchenordnung, einen Katechismus und die Kirchenzucht einzuführen. Im September 1541 kehrte Calvin nach Genf zurück, und noch im gleichen Jahr entstand unter seiner Federführung die Genfer Kirchenordnung. 1542 folgte der zweite Genfer Katechismus. In der Folgezeit kam es zwischen dem Rat der Stadt und Calvin immer wieder zu Spannungen, weil er mehr Selbständigkeit für die Kirche forderte, als der Rat zugestehen wollte. Vieles geschah aber auch im Konsens, nicht zuletzt die Verbannungen von Theologen, die eine aus Sicht Calvins und des Rats falsche Lehre vertraten. Im Oktober 1553 kam es zur Hinrichtung des spanischen Arztes Michael Servetus, der auf Veranlassung Calvins durch Beschluss des Rats der Stadt zum Tode verurteilt wurde, weil Servetus die Trinitätslehre ablehnte. Calvin war, wie auch in zahlreichen weiteren Fällen von Verbannungs- und Todesurteilen, eindeutig der Hauptverantwortliche für Servetus’ öffentliche Hinrichtung in Genf; er behauptete später, sich vergeblich für eine „milde“ Form der Hinrichtung eingesetzt haben. Servetus wurde auf dem Scheiterhaufen verbrannt. Am 10. August 1540 heirateten Calvin und Idelette de Bure. Sie war ein Mitglied der Strassburger Flüchtlingsgemeinde, war seit kurzem verwitwet und brachte zwei Kinder mit in die Ehe. Der am 28. Juli 1542 geborene gemeinsame Sohn Jacques starb im Alter von etwa vier Wochen. Idelette de Bure starb am 29. März 1549 in Genf. 1552 und 1553 setzte sich Calvin für die Freilassung der Fünf Märtyrer von Lyon ein, fünf im römisch-katholischen Lyon inhaftierte reformiert gesinnte Theologen, die kurz zuvor ihr Studium in Lausanne und Genf abgeschlossen hatten, und betreute sie brieflich auch seelsorgerlich: Ihre Lehre entsprach seiner eigenen. Sie starben am 16. Mai 1553 auf dem Scheiterhaufen. Calvins Arbeit wurde nach und nach nicht nur in Genf anerkannt, obwohl er noch bis 1555 stark umstritten war. In Kirchenkreisen war er aber nach dieser Zeit doch äusserst einflussreich. Da Calvin lange noch französischer Bürger war, konnte er zwar keinem politischen Gremium angehören, übte aber gestützt auf seine überragende Autorität, die es ihm ermöglichte, sich die politischen Gremien gefügig zu machen, gleichwohl schliesslich geradezu diktatorische Macht aus. „Vierzehn Jahre kämpfte Calvin mit dem Rat und den politischen Instanzen der Stadt [Genf] um die Macht […]. Er vermochte […] sowohl die Geistlichkeit als auch die in kirchlichen Dingen allmächtige Oberistanz des Konsistoriums geschlossen hinter sich zu bringen. Zudem konnte er auf die Ergebenheit der […] Glaubensflüchtlinge zählen. Desgleichen verstand er sich bei einem Teil der städtischen Politiker in Respekt zu setzen. Mit dieser Hausmacht brachte er auf dem Umweg über das kirchliche Sittenregiment, die Kirchenzucht, einzelne Personen und kleinere Gruppen seiner politischen Gegner aus der altgenferischen Führungsschicht nach und nach zu Fall. Im Jahr des Augsburger Religionsfriedens, 1555, gewannen seine Anhänger in den entscheidenden politischen Gremien des Stadtstaats die Mehrheit. Seitdem war Calvin der mächtigste Mann in Genf. Nach dem Umschwung von 1555 machten seine Anhänger von der Macht, die sie legal ergriffen hatten, gegen die politische und kirchliche Opposition rigoros Gebrauch. Sie verbannten ihre Gegner, liessen Todesurteile fällen und konfiszierten das Vermögen der Missliebigen. Angehörige der wohlhabenden Schichten verliessen in Mengen die Stadt.“ Bereits das 1553 ergangene Todesurteil gegen Michael Servetus war unter dem bestimmenden Einfluss Calvins zustande gekommen, den der Genfer Rat „als Ankläger und, wie in anderen Fällen auch, als juristisch-theologische Sachverständigen zugleich zum Prozeß heran“ zog. Die Anzeige war von Calvins Privatsekretär Nicolas de la Fontaine zweifellos im Auftrage seines Herrn erhoben worden. Aus der Untersuchungshaft, die das Genfer Prozessrecht auch für den Ankläger vorsah, war er bezeichnender Weise aufgrund einer Bürgschaft von Calvins Bruder Antoine Calvin nach nur einem Tag entlassen worden. 1559 gründete Calvin die Genfer Akademie, die zur Hochschule des Calvinismus wurde. Nach jahrelanger Krankheit starb er 1564 in Genf. Sein Grab befindet sich auf dem Cimetière des Rois im Genfer Stadtteil Plainpalais. |
G;|Falco (* 19. Februar 1957 in Wien; † 6. Februar 1998 nahe Puerto Plata, Dominikanische Republik; eigentlich Johann „Hans“ Hölzel) war ein österreichischer Musiker. Sein Titel Rock Me Amadeus erreichte als bis heute einziges deutschsprachiges Lied die Spitze der US-Billboard-Charts.   Anfänge (1977–1980) Johann Hölzel zog für einige Monate nach West-Berlin, wo er als Jazz-Bassist durch verschiedene Clubs tingelte und mit der Musikszene in Berührung kam. In einem österreichischen Hotel sah er am 1. Jänner 1978 das „Neujahrsspringen“ der Vierschanzentournee, bei dem ihn der „Falke“ genannte DDR-Skispringer Falko Weißpflog beeindruckte; Hölzel beschloss, sich nach dem Sportler zu benennen. Um eine bessere internationale Vermarktbarkeit zu erzielen, änderte er die Schreibweise des Namens zu Falco. Zunächst ließ er sich bei einigen Auftritten als Falco Gottehrer bzw. Falco Stürmer ankündigen, doch fielen diese Zunamen nach kurzer Zeit wieder weg. Auch seinen bürgerlichen Namen änderte er in dieser Zeit in das internationalere Hoelzel. Zurück in Wien, trat Falco dem Ersten Wiener Musiktheater (später Hallucination Company) bei, einem avantgardistischen Rocktheater. Mit dieser Gruppe erzielte er erste Erfolge, die zunächst auf die Wiener Szene beschränkt waren. Im Jahresverlauf wechselte er zur politischen Anarcho-Band Drahdiwaberl (parallel dazu spielte er ab 1978 auch noch in der eigenen Band Spinning Wheel). Als Bassist und gelegentlicher Sänger zeigte Falco neben seinem musikalischen Talent auch schon seine exaltierte Seite: Bei den Auftritten der „Chaotenband“ schützte er seine Designerkleidung durch Plastiküberzüge vor Beschädigung. Sein selbst geschriebenes Stück Ganz Wien, das von der Band lediglich als Solo-Pausenfüller gedacht war, trug Falco 1980 als Sänger vor. Das Lied, das den Drogenkonsum in der Wiener Szene thematisierte, wurde zum Underground-Hit in der österreichischen Hauptstadt; der Hörfunk boykottierte es. Im Mai 1979 produzierte Falco seine erste Single mit den Titeln Chance to Dance und Summer, die erst 28 Jahre später im Rahmen einer Werbeaktion für die Wiener Einkaufsstraßen in Form einer Werbe-CD veröffentlicht wurden. Diese CD enthält sowohl die beiden Originalaufnahmen als auch jeweils einen mit zusätzlichen Gitarrenparts versehenen Remix sowie ein Interview mit dem Produzenten der Platte, René Reitz. Die ersten Alben (1981–1984) Der Wiener Plattenunternehmer Markus Spiegel erkannte bei einem Konzert der Band Drahdiwaberl Falcos Talent und schloss mit ihm einen Vertrag über drei Solo-LPs ab; auch die Band wurde unter Vertrag genommen. Als erstes erschien Mitte 1981 das Band-Studio-Album Psychoterror, auf dem auch die Nummer Ganz Wien zu finden ist. Im Herbst erschien die englische Version That Scene, Falcos Debütsingle, welche sogar im Radio gespielt wurde und auf Platz 11 der Ö3-Hitparade kam. Weitere Veröffentlichungen dieses Liedes, nun wieder auf Deutsch, folgten auf seinem Debütalbum und der Rückseite der dritten Single Maschine brennt. Markus Spiegel brachte Falco mit dem Musikproduzenten und Soundmixer Robert Ponger zusammen, der im Sommer 1981 ein Lied für Reinhold Bilgeri komponiert hatte, dem es aber nicht gefiel – im Gegensatz zu Falco, der einen Text dazu schrieb. Zusammen produzierten sie den Titel Der Kommissar, der schnell zum Club-Hit aufstieg. Im Herbst 1981 wurde Der Kommissar veröffentlicht und bescherte Falco 1982 europaweit Top-Positionen. Auch in Übersee verzeichnete die Single beachtliche Erfolge: In Kanada erhielt Falco für die Single Gold, in den USA schaffte er es mit dem Titel auf Platz 72. Falco war nach der Gruppe Kraftwerk mit ihrem Titel Autobahn erst der zweite Künstler, der mit einem deutschen Text in die US-Charts gelangte. Auch in Guatemala führte der Song die Hitparade an. Insgesamt wurde Der Kommissar weltweit etwa sieben Millionen Mal verkauft, allein in Frankreich 750.000 Mal. Der Titel war weltweit der erste kommerziell erfolgreiche Rap-Song eines Weißen. Mit der Produktion der Musikvideos zu den Singles entstand eine Zusammenarbeit zwischen Falco und den Regisseuren Hannes Rossacher und Rudi Dolezal (DoRo Produktion), die bis zu seinem Tod anhalten sollte. Im selben Jahr erschien das dazugehörige Album Einzelhaft, das sich an die Spitze der österreichischen Charts setzen konnte und weltweit rund eine dreiviertel Million Mal verkauft wurde. Das zweite Album, Junge Roemer, das ebenfalls von Robert Ponger produziert wurde, erschien 1984. Obwohl das Album später als Falcos gelungenste Platte betrachtet wurde, blieben die Verkaufszahlen deutlich hinter den hohen Erwartungen zurück, die der Vorgänger Einzelhaft geweckt hatte: 120.000 Mal wurde die Platte in Deutschland verkauft, in Österreich erhielt Falco für die erreichten Verkaufszahlen eine Goldene Schallplatte. Um den Plattenverkauf etwas zu steigern, nahm Falco den Song Kann es Liebe sein im Duett mit Désirée Nosbusch neu auf, doch auch dies war nicht sehr erfolgreich. Junge Roemer war das erste Album, das vollständig verfilmt wurde; gedreht wurde in verschiedenen Teilen der Vereinigten Staaten, unter anderem im Chelsea Hotel. Dort wurde No Answer mit dem österreichischen Fotomodell Brigitta Cimarolli gedreht. Die Ausstrahlung unter dem Titel Falco – Helden von heute erfolgte 1984 in der ORF-Reihe Helden von heute. Internationaler Durchbruch (1985–1987) Nach dem kommerziellen Misserfolg mit Junge Roemer verließ Falco Robert Ponger und wechselte 1985 zum niederländischen Produzenten-Duo Rob und Ferdi Bolland. Zunächst produzierte er mit den beiden Brüdern das Album Falco 3. Beeinflusst von Milos Formans Kinofilm Amadeus und zahlreichen neuen Mozart-Biografien entstand dazu Rock Me Amadeus, Falcos größter Hit. Nachdem der Titel bereits zahlreiche Top-Positionen in Europa erreicht hatte, stieg der Song Anfang 1986 Woche für Woche in den Top Ten der US-amerikanischen Billboard-Charts, um schließlich am 20. März 1986 für drei Wochen Platz 1 zu erreichen, was zuvor keinem anderen deutschsprachigen Titel gelungen war. Gleichzeitig erreichte das Album Falco 3 Platz 3 der Billboard 200. Rock Me Amadeus wurde wenige Wochen später auch noch in Großbritannien auf dem 1. Platz gelistet. Falco war zum Weltstar aufgestiegen. Doch der unerwartete Erfolg hatte für Falco auch seine Schattenseiten, denn die eigene Messlatte war damit sehr hoch gelegt, und er hegte Zweifel, ob er an diesen Erfolg noch einmal anknüpfen könne oder die Spitze des Ruhms damit erreicht sei. Im deutschsprachigen Raum gab es eine heftige Kontroverse über sein Lied Jeanny. Nachdem der Titel nach Rock Me Amadeus und Vienna Calling als dritte Single ausgekoppelt worden und das dazugehörige Video im Fernsehen gelaufen war, brach ein Streit über den Inhalt aus. Viele Sendeanstalten verweigerten das Abspielen, weil Jeanny ihrer Meinung nach eine Gewalttat nicht nur beschrieb, sondern sogar verherrlichte. Die Boykotte konnten den Erfolg nicht schmälern; vielmehr wurde der Absatz auf diese Weise noch erhöht (Streisand-Effekt): Jeanny belegte Anfang 1986 acht Wochen lang den 1. Platz in Deutschland und wurde mit einer Verkaufszahl von 2,5 Millionen Stück die meistverkaufte Single des Jahres. Nach seiner Tournee im Sommer 1986 schloss Falco die Arbeit am vierten Album Emotional ab, das im Herbst desselben Jahres erschien. Auf diesem Album befinden sich unter anderem die Singles The Sound of Musik (mit der Falco die umstrittene Wahl des österreichischen Bundespräsidenten Waldheim thematisierte), Coming Home (Jeanny Part 2, Ein Jahr danach) und Emotional. Nach Erscheinen dieses Albums ging Falco auf eine Welttournee, die ihn von Österreich über Deutschland und die Schweiz bis nach Japan führte. Die sechs Konzerte in Japan sollten dann auch der „Testlauf“ für Auftritte in den USA sein, die zwischen Jänner und März 1987 geplant waren. Nach dem immensen Erfolg von Rock Me Amadeus und anderer guter Platzierungen weltweit war für Falco die Möglichkeit gegeben, sich dauerhaft als Weltstar zu etablieren. Doch der Japan-Abstecher und Falcos persönliche Haltung vereitelten dieses Ansinnen. Von Heimweh geplagt, traf Falco die Entscheidung, die Weltstar-Ambitionen zu beenden, da sie längere Auslandsaufenthalte bedingt hätten. In einem späteren Interview sagte er: „Ich hätte oftmals Gelegenheit gehabt, nach Amerika zu gehen. Ich habe es nicht getan, weil das Schönste an der amerikanischen Fahne die rotweißroten Streifen sind.“ Rückschläge (1988–1991) 1987 machte Falco musikalisch wenig von sich reden. Nach der kräfteraubenden Japan-Tour war er körperlich und psychisch in einer schlechten Verfassung und zog sich in der Folge weitgehend aus der Öffentlichkeit zurück. Nachdem im Frühjahr mit Emotional lediglich der Titeltrack seines letzten Albums veröffentlicht wurde (welcher sich in den Charts als nur mäßig erfolgreich erwies), begann er in der zweiten Jahreshälfte mit der Arbeit an neuem musikalischen Material. Die Aufnahmen zu seinem fünften Album, das er mit Gunther Mende und Candy de Rouge produzieren wollte, verliefen jedoch schleppend und wurden schließlich ganz eingestellt, nachdem seitens der Plattenfirma die Qualität der wenigen bis dato eingespielten Titel bemängelt wurde. Als einzige Neuveröffentlichung erschien die zusammen mit Brigitte Nielsen aufgenommene und von Giorgio Moroder produzierte Single Body Next to Body, die allerdings nicht an die Erfolge der beiden vorherigen Jahre anknüpfen konnte. 1988 kam es nach einem zwischenzeitlichen Zerwürfnis mit den Bolland-Brüdern doch noch einmal zu einer Zusammenarbeit mit den beiden holländischen Hit-Lieferanten. Mit ihrer Hilfe wurden die Aufnahmen zum neuen Album wieder aufgenommen und zu Ende gebracht. Im Herbst des Jahres erschien schließlich die Platte Wiener Blut. Diese kam in Deutschland zwar in die Top 10 und erreichte in Österreich Platz zwei, doch war ihr kein anhaltender kommerzieller Erfolg beschieden; die Verkaufszahlen blieben deutlich hinter denen des Vorgängers Emotional zurück. Von der geplanten Europatournee fand nur das Auftaktkonzert in Oldenburg statt, die restlichen Auftritte wurden wegen zu geringer Nachfrage abgesagt. Nach dem Misserfolg von Wiener Blut beendete Falco abermals die Zusammenarbeit mit den Bolland-Brüdern. Mit Robert Ponger, der bereits Falcos erste beiden Alben produziert hatte, nahm er 1990 das Album Data de Groove auf. Die Platte und die gleichnamige Single gelangten zwar in die österreichischen Charts (Platz 11 bei den Alben, Platz 12 bei den Singles), doch außerhalb seiner Heimat konnte Falco keine nennenswerte Notierung verbuchen. Data de Groove markierte somit Falcos kommerziellen Tiefpunkt. In einem Gespräch aus dem Jahr 1991 mit einem Redakteur des Rennbahn-Express sagte Falco: „›Data de Groove‹ war ein introvertiertes, sehr privates Album. Die Menschen wollen nicht bei meinem Semester an der Universität teilnehmen, bis sie es verstehen. Ich werde nicht mehr Texte produzieren wie z. B. ‚The mega the score desto mono de chrome‘. Ich will es besser machen. Ich fühle mich jetzt stärker, als was ich vor fünf Jahren gemacht habe. Zu dieser Zeit war ein Durcheinander, aber heute arbeite ich an meiner Karriere wie nie zuvor.“ Comeback (1992–1994) Im Herbst 1992 erschien das Album Nachtflug, das sich deutlich besser verkaufte als Data de Groove. Auch die Singleauskopplung Titanic konnte – zumindest in Österreich – an die alten Erfolge anknüpfen. Kurz vor Veröffentlichung des Albums Nachtflug gab Falco ein Interview, in dem er auch über die Thematik des Songs Titanic sprach: „Ich hab 200 Freunde gefragt, was ihnen zu dem Wort ‚Dekadenz‘ einfällt. Alle haben etwas anderes gesagt, aber es hat immer irgendwie was mit mir zu tun gehabt. Laut Duden heißt es ja ‚Untergang‘, und dann war für mich klar: Die Titanic […] wird wahrscheinlich nicht an Erfolge wie Rock Me Amadeus anschließen können, aber ich glaube schon, dass es ein kräftiges Lebenszeichen sein wird. […] Die Titanic befasst sich auf jeden Fall kritisch mit der Gesellschaft, die glaubt, dass ihr im Fallen die Flügel wachsen, und ich meine, dieser Gesellschaft gehören wir auch an!“ Vom Erfolg des Albums Nachtflug motiviert, ging Falco im Mai 1993 wieder auf Europa-Tournee. Im Rahmen dieser Tour trat er einen Monat später beim Wiener Donauinselfest vor rund 150.000 Besuchern auf. Obwohl ein heftiges Gewitter die Zuschauer durchnässte und ein Teil der Bühnentechnik ausfiel, wurde das Konzert zunächst fortgesetzt, später aber wegen der Regenmenge und der defekten Technik vorzeitig beendet. Im September des Jahres war Falco Gast beim Jubilée-Konzert von Opus im Grazer Orpheum, um das 20-jährige Bestehen der Band zu feiern. Er sang zusammen mit Opus-Sänger Herwig Rüdisser den Opus-Hit Flyin’ High. Stilwechsel (1995–1997) 1995 veröffentlichte Falco die Single Mutter, der Mann mit dem Koks ist da, eine Techno-Version eines Alt-Berliner Gassenhauers aus den 1920er Jahren. Dafür wählte er das Pseudonym T>>MA, um so dem Druck einer neuen Falco-Single zu entgehen. Ein halbes Jahr später stürmte der Titel die Charts und bescherte Falco unverhofft einen neuen Hit. Im Sommer 1996 wurde die Dance-Nummer Naked (unter Falco feat. T>>MB) veröffentlicht, die die Erfolgsaussichten des geplanten neuen Albums Egoisten (so der ursprüngliche Titel von Out of the Dark) lancieren sollte. Während die Single in Österreich bis auf Platz 4 kam, wurden in Deutschland nicht einmal 50.000 Exemplare verkauft. Dieser Misserfolg führte dazu, dass Falco seine Ideen für das neue Album verwarf und dessen Veröffentlichung auf unbestimmte Zeit verschoben wurde. Naked wurde die letzte Veröffentlichung zu Falcos Lebzeiten. Am 19. Februar 1997 beging Falco mit einem großen Fest seinen 40. Geburtstag, auf dem er vor den versammelten Gästen einige seiner großen Hits spielte und ein Preview auf das neue Album gab. Anwesend war auch Niki Lauda, ein langjähriger Wegbegleiter Falcos, der später eine Boeing 737 auf den Namen Falco taufte. Silvester 1997 hatte Falco seinen letzten offiziellen Live-Auftritt in der Excalibur City. Anfang 1998 flog Falco nach der gemeinsamen Weihnachtsfeier mit seiner Mutter zurück in seine karibische Wahlheimat, die Dominikanische Republik. Er wird vom Tagesspiegel als „der erste weiße Rapper“ bezeichnet. Tod (1998) Am 6. Februar 1998 starb Falco bei einem Autounfall auf der Straße zwischen den Städten Villa Montellano und Puerto Plata in der Dominikanischen Republik. Bei der Ausfahrt vom Parkplatz der „Turist Disco“ rammte ein Bus seinen Geländewagen – Falco war sofort tot. Bei der Obduktion wurden bei ihm ein Blutalkoholwert von 1,5 ‰ und große Mengen an Kokain sowie Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) nachgewiesen. In der Folgezeit kam das Gerücht auf, Falco habe sich selbst das Leben genommen. Dies lag in erster Linie an der entsprechend interpretierten Textzeile „Muss ich denn sterben, um zu leben?“ aus dem Titel Out of the Dark; allerdings entstand das Lied bereits einige Jahre vor Falcos Tod und wurde auch nicht von ihm geschrieben, sondern von Torsten Börger. Nach der Überführung seines Leichnams nach Österreich wurde Falco im Beisein von über 4.000 Fans auf dem Wiener Zentralfriedhof in einem ehrenhalber gewidmeten Grab (Gruppe 40, Nummer 64 ⊙48.14759722222216.443827777778170) beerdigt. Sein Sarg wurde von Mitgliedern der Wiener Motorrad-Rocker „Outsider Austria“ (diese hatten 1985 im Video zu Rock Me Amadeus mitgespielt) zu Grabe getragen. Auch Jahre nach Falcos Tod ist sein Grab eine Pilgerstätte seiner Fans, von denen manche – unter anderem in einem gläsernen Schrein am Fußende des Grabes – Blumen hinterlegen und Kerzen anzünden. |
G;|Denez Prigent (* 17. Februar 1966 in Santec, Département Finistère) ist ein Liedermacher und Interpret bretonischer Lieder. Seine bevorzugten Stilrichtungen sind der Kan ha diskan (Tanzlied) und die Gwerz (Klagelied), ein dramatischer Gesang, der eine Geschichte oder Legende erzählt. Seit seinen ersten Auftritten mit 16 Jahren hat er sich mit der a-cappella-Interpretation traditioneller Gesänge einen Namen gemacht; später mit der Modernisierung bretonischer Musik, bei der Originaltexte von einer Mischung aus akustischen Instrumenten und elektronischen Klängen begleitet werden. Bisher hat er fünf Studio-Alben sowie ein Live-Album veröffentlicht und gibt regelmäßig Konzerte in Frankreich und in anderen Ländern.   Die Anfänge in der Familie Während seiner Kindheit verbringt Denez Prigent die Wochenenden bei seinen Großeltern. Bei seiner Großmutter entdeckt er die Harmonie zwischen der bretonischen Sprache, der Natur und dem Gesang. Als Internatsschüler in Brest zieht er das Hören bretonischer Lieder mit dem Walkman dem Studium vor. Mit 14 Jahren wird er von Alain Leclère, einem ehemaligen Schüler von Manuel Kerjean in den Kan ha Diskan eingeweiht. Dieser wiederum ist dafür bekannt, andere bretonische Sänger wie Erik Marchand ausgebildet zu haben. Zwei Jahre später, 1982, singt er im Duo mit Alain Leclère bei den festoù-noz. Er gewinnt mehrere Preise beim Kan ar Bobl, einem Gesangswettbewerb in der Bretagne. Erwähnenswert sind die ersten Preise beim Kan ha diskan 1987, beim neuen bretonischen Gesang 1988 und beim traditionellen Gesang 1990. 1988 bewegt ihn seine Leidenschaft für die bretonische Sprache dazu, Dozent für Bretonisch in Carhaix zu werden. Gleichzeitig ist er zu Festivals traditioneller Musik eingeladen, wie zum Beispiel Les Tombées de la Nuit in Rennes und das Festival Interceltique in Lorient. Die Bürgermeisterin von Rennes, das 1991 Partnerstadt von Alma-Ata wird (Almaty, frühere Hauptstadt von Kasachstan), schlägt ihm vor, beim dortigen Festival Voice of Asia zu singen. Überrascht von dieser Einladung, schreibt er das humoristische Lied Son Alma Ata, das später auf dem Album Sarac'h veröffentlicht wird. Es spricht die Abwegigkeit an, als Bretone nach Kasachstan zum Singen eingeladen zu werden. Dieses erste Konzert im Ausland gibt ihm die Gelegenheit, das kasachische Volk kennenzulernen, das zu dieser Zeit der Union der Sozialistischen Sowjetrepubliken (UdSSR) angehört, und eine Parallele zum bretonischen Volk und Frankreich zu ziehen. 1991 tritt Denez Prigent von seiner Stelle als Dozent zurück, um sich ganz dem Gesang zu widmen. Beim Sammeln von Texten traditioneller Lieder begegnet er Eugénie Ebrel, eine der Sœurs Goadec, die ihm Ti Eliz Iza diktiert, und ihrer Tochter Louise Ebrel, die beschließt, ihn auf der Bühne zu begleiten. 1992 singt er a cappella beim Festival Transmusicales in Rennes vor einem nicht eingeweihten Rock-Publikum, das ihm Beifall zollt. Auf Grund dieses Erfolgs verlässt er die Gruppe Daouarn, mit der er auf seinen ersten festoù-noz aufgetreten war. Er nimmt teil am Montreux Jazz Festival in der Schweiz, den Francofolies, der Midem, dem Printemps de Bourges, am Coup de Cœur francophone (Quebec, Kanada), dem Festival Mitte Europa (Deutschland – Österreich – Tschechien), den Celtic Connections (Schottland), der Expo '98 (Portugal), oder auch am Festival Eisteddfod (Wales). Ein erstes Album a cappella Im Jahr 1993 veröffentlicht er sein erstes Album Ar gouriz koar (der Wachsgürtel). Obwohl Ar gouriz koar nicht für ein Album bestimmt ist, sondern eher eine Demoaufnahme zum Beispiel für Veranstalter von Festivals sein soll, werden beinahe 50.000 Exemplare verkauft. Die Lieder dieses ersten Albums sind überwiegend traditionell und bis auf drei a cappella interpretiert. Plac'h Landelo stammt aus der Feder von Bernez Tangi, Gwerz ar vezhinerien von Denez Abernot - beides Mitglieder der ehemaligen Gruppe Storlok -, während Gwerz an aksidan von Denez Prigent selbst ist. Seit diesem ersten Album bleibt er den zwei Hauptgattungen des bretonischen Gesangs treu: der Kan ha diskan, und die arhythmischen Gwerz, in der der Sänger zur gleichen Zeit die Gefühle herüber bringen muss, in der er von einem tragischen Ereignis erzählt. Das Label Auvidis/Silex, bei dem Ar gouriz koar erschienen ist, bezahlt den Sänger nicht. Dieser unterzeichnet bei Barclay für sein folgendes Album und geht gerichtlich gegen Auvidis/Silex vor. Er erreicht, dass das Album nicht mehr vertrieben wird, als Revanche behält das Label die Bänder. Denez Prigent beschließt deshalb, es für eine zweite Ausgabe vollständig neu aufzunehmen. Diese wird 1996 bei Barclay veröffentlicht, wie alle seine folgenden Alben. Der Inhalt der Neuauflage ist leicht verändert. An Stelle von Gwerz Penmarc'h, Deuit Ganin und Son Marivonig sind andere traditionelle Titel auf dem Album: Ar bugel koar, Ar goulenn, Biskoazh kement all ! und P'edon war bont an Naoned. Man findet dort auch Tio, tio, ein Wiegenlied, von Germain Horellou geschrieben. Die Neuauflage ist für Denez Prigent auch die Gelegenheit, die vereinheitlichte bretonische Orthographie zu übernehmen (brezhoneg peurunvan- das einheitliche Bretonisch). Die Begegnung mit der elektronischen Musik Unter dem Einfluss seiner Frau begibt sich Denez Prigent im Jahr 1993 trotz seiner Vorurteile auf die erste in Rennes veranstaltete Rave-Party. Dort entdeckt er eine Musik, die, wie die bretonische Musik, dem Tanz dient. Ihm fällt auf, dass die elektronische Musik der bretonischen technisch ähnlich ist, in Bezug auf Rhythmus und den nah beieinander liegenden Tönen. Seitdem hat er die Vorstellung, sie zur Begleitung seines Gesangs zu verwenden. 1995 nimmt Denez Prigent an Dao Dezi teil. Dieses Projekt von Eric Mouquet (vom Duo Deep Forest) und Guilan Joncheray hat die Zielvorstellung, mit der bretonischen Musik genauso zu verfahren, wie Deep Forest mit der afrikanischen Musik verfahren ist, nämlich die traditionellen Texte und die elektronische Musik zu verschmelzen. Michel Sanchez, das andere Mitglied von Deep Forest, nimmt an dem Album teil, das von Erwin Autrique aufgenommen und abgemischt wird. Die bretonischen Sänger Arnaud Maisonneuve und Manu Lann Huel sind ebenfalls beteiligt, genauso wie die Gruppe Tri Yann. Es ist das erste Mal, dass Denez Prigent bretonischen Gesang und elektronische Musik mischt. Ein Funke Gold Im Jahr 1997 veröffentlicht er sein zweites Album Me 'zalc'h ennon ur fulenn aour (Ich bewahre in mir einen Funken Gold). Denez Prigent schreibt alle Texte (abgesehen von dem traditionellen Stück Ar rannoù, Auszug aus dem Barzaz Breiz) und die meisten Melodien, in denen traditionelle Instrumente und elektronische Klänge miteinander verschmolzen werden. Die Texte sprechen die klassischen Themen der Gwerz an: Ungerechtigkeit, Krankheit und Tod. E trouz ar gêr, über die künstliche Seite eines Lebens in der Stadt, und An hentoù adkavet, über die Wiedergeburt des Tro Breizh, sind seine ersten der Bretagne, seiner Kultur und seiner Beziehung zur Natur gewidmeten Lieder. Für die Auswahl der elektronischen Klänge nimmt Denez Prigent Kontakt zu Arnaud Rebotini auf, der ihm seine Plattensammlung öffnet. Die meisten verwendeten Samples sind Jungle-Klänge, deren Tempo, in der Größenordnung von 160 bis 170 bpm, gut zum bretonischen Gesang passt. Für die meisten Arrangements wird zuerst der Gesang aufgenommen, die elektronischen Klänge werden anschließend hinzugefügt. Diese Kombination aus altem Gesang und sehr moderner Musik wird bei Ar rannoù veranschaulicht, einer der ältesten Texte in bretonischer Sprache. Dabei setzt Denez Prigent die traditionelle Melodie mit elektronischen Klängen neu zusammen. Obwohl das Publikum angesichts des großen Unterschieds zwischen dem a-cappella-Gesang des Debüt-Albums und den Samples des zweiten Albums gespalten ist, meint Denez Prigent, dass das Wesentliche bewahrt bleibt: die Treue zur arhythmischen Seite der bretonischen Musik, ohne festes Metrum. Besonders in der Gwerz muss der Sänger vorrangig die Intensität des Gesangs vermitteln, und dabei nicht im Rhythmus singen, stattdessen aber in geeigneten Momenten Pausen setzen. Für Denez Prigent wird eine Gwerz mit festem Zeitmaß zum Chanson, während ein elektronisches Arrangement, das die arhythmische Seite berücksichtigt, vollkommen natürlich ist. Gleichermaßen misst er der traditionellen Aussprache der bretonischen Sprache eine große Bedeutung zu, die das dibril beinhaltet, ein gerolltes R, das nur im gesungenen Bretonisch gebraucht wird. Wichtig für ihn ist ebenfalls, den Regeln des Gwerz-Schreibens treu zu bleiben, mit Texten, die oft sehr lang sind, und von denen nur ein Teil auf dem Album aufgenommen ist, und ihren zeitlosen Themen, die nicht der Mode unterworfen sind. Diese Form des Gesangs geht zurück bis ins 5. Jahrhundert. Diese Treue zur Tradition ist auf keinen Fall ein Weg, sich in sich selbst zu verschließen. Im Gegenteil, für Denez Prigent ist die Weiterentwicklung der bretonischen Musik ein Weg, sich anderen Kulturen zu öffnen. Die Verse von Denez Prigent sind in der Mehrheit achtsilbig, mit einer Zäsur, die sich im Allgemeinen in der Mitte befindet. Diese Form ist üblich in der bretonischen Sprache, die eine Vielzahl von ein- oder zweisilbigen Wörtern besitzt und deshalb keine langen Verse braucht. Er schreibt nur in Bretonisch, einer Sprache, die – laut ihm – im Gegensatz zum Französischen ihre heilige Seite (Côté Sacré) bewahren konnte. Als Folge bleiben manche Gesänge unübersetzbar, sogar für ihren zweisprachigen Autor. 1998 nimmt er an der Rockoper Excalibur, la légende des Celtes teil, gemeinsam mit Roger Hodgson (Ex-Sänger der Gruppe Supertramp), Angelo Branduardi, Didier Lockwood u.a. Sur le chemin d'écume Im Jahr 2000 veröffentlicht Denez Prigent sein neues Album mit dem Titel Irvi – Plural des Worts erv. Es bezeichnet einen Damm oder einen Weg, der eine Insel mit dem Festland oder zwei Inseln untereinander verbindet und der nur bei Ebbe benutzbar ist. Der Gesang Hent-eon (chemin d'écume) - sozusagen das Titellied - beschreibt den Wunsch eines Einwohners von Lesconil, auf einem dieser Wege begraben zu werden, um dort für immer von der Natur behütet zu sein. Diese Idee einer Verbindung zwischen zwei Welten, zwischen dem Leben und dem Tod, wird in Daouzek huñvre (zwölf Träume) wiederholt, wo sieben verlorene Seelen in ihrer fleischlichen Hülle - eine hinter der anderen - auf einem chemin d'écume gehen. In der Fortführung von Me 'zalc'h ennon ur fulenn aour schreibt Denez Prigent alle Texte und die meisten Melodien. Auch in diesem Album verschmelzen traditionelle Instrumente mit elektronischen Klängen. Letztere sind dezenter als in dem vorhergehenden Album. Irvi klingt deshalb weniger jungle und mehr new age. Unter den Gastmusikern sind der Jazz-Musiker Louis Sclavis, der Drehleierspieler Valentin Clastrier, und der Uilleann Pipes-Spieler Davy Spillane. Zum ersten Mal kommen französische Texte in einem Album von Denez Prigent vor. Sie sind von Bertrand Cantat in Daouzek huñvr gesprochen, dessen Struktur die zwölf Serien von Ar rannoù anspricht. Eine weitere Stimme auf diesem Album ist die von Lisa Gerrard, der Sängerin von Dead Can Dance, in Gortoz a ran (ich warte). Dieses Lied, mit dem das Album beginnt, ist im Soundtrack des Ridley Scott-Films Black Hawk Down enthalten. Als weitere Gastmusiker begleiten der Bagad Kemper Denez Prigent in E trouz ar gêr und Ar sonerien du (beide auf der Bonus-CD). Letzteres ist ein Lied über die Legende der schwarzen Musiker, einem Bläser-Duo aus Dudelsack und Bombarde. Diese werden von Polizisten festgenommen, weil sie diese für zwei Diebe halten, die sie suchen. Die zwei Musiker werden gehängt und in Pont l'Abbé begraben, bevor ihre Unschuld bewiesen ist. Ihre Gräber sind noch heute ein Wallfahrtsort. Denez Prigent liefert eine persönliche Version dieser Legende, in welcher die Polizisten die Musiker selbst töten und hängen, um nicht zugeben zu müssen, dass sie die wirklichen Diebe haben entkommen lassen. Diese Version betont das Bild der Ausschweifung, das die Konformisten zu jener Zeit mit der Festmusik verbanden. Das Album ist nominiert für die Victoires de la Musique 2001. Nach einer Reihe von Konzerten nimmt Denez Prigent das Album Live Holl a-gevret ! beim Festival Interceltique 2001 in Lorient auf, mit dem Bagad Roñsed-Mor aus Locoal-Mendon als Gastmusiker. Sarac'h, die Rückkehr zu den Ursprüngen Das folgende Album Sarac'h (Rauschen des Winds im Blattwerk) erscheint im Jahr 2003. Man findet dort Lisa Gerrard wieder, aber auch Yanka Rupkina, die Solistin von Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares (Das Geheimnis der bulgarischen Stimmen), Karen Matheson von der Gruppe Capercaillie und die samische Sängerin Mari Boine. Denez Prigent lädt auch den Bouzouki-Spieler Dónal Lunny ein, den Oud-Spieler Nabil Khalidi und den Violinisten Farhad Bouallagi. Obwohl dieses Album immer noch elektronische Klänge enthält, sind die akustischen Instrumente dominant. Zwei traditionelle Stücke eröffnen das Album: An hini a garan, mit Lisa Gerrard, und E garnison !, im Duett mit Louise Ebrel. Denez Prigent integriert zwei unveröffentlichte, 1991 zu Beginn seiner Karriere, geschriebene Texte in Sarac'h: Son Alma Ata und Ar gwez-sapin. Im Gegensatz zu den vorherigen Alben enthält Sarac'h sehr persönliche Texte, in denen der Autor von sich selbst spricht: N'eus forzh… spricht die Bedeutung des Singens an, dank dem Denez Prigent sich niemals entmutigen lässt (leskiñ a ra va zan atav: mein Feuer brennt immer). Er nimmt auch einen Vers wieder auf, der schon in E trouz ar gêr enthalten ist und der seine Lebensweise zusammenfasst: n'eus ket un deiz na ganfen ket (es gibt keinen Tag, an dem ich nicht singe). Dispi ist eine sehr pessimistische Bestandsaufnahme über den Zustand der Kultur und den der bretonischen Sprache, ein wesentliches Thema für Denez Prigent. Er spricht dort von seiner Verzweiflung angesichts dieser Situation. Er schreibt, dass der Traum von der Rückkehr zur Harmonie zwischen den Generationen rund um die bretonische Sprache und Kultur eine Verrücktheit ist. Das Titellied fasst für sich allein die wesentlichen Überzeugungen von Denez Prigent zusammen. Es spricht seine Rückkehr zur Natur an, als er, gewöhnt an den unaufhörlichen Lärm der Autos auf der Straße, an der er in Rennes wohnt, sich entschließt, ein Haus in Lanvellec (Département Côtes d'Armor) zu kaufen. Zu dieser Zeit entdeckt er die Stille der Natur wieder, vor dem Hintergrund des Windrauschens in den Bäumen. Er gewinnt daraus den Eindruck, den er in Worte fasst: Die Modernisierung trennt die Leute von der Natur und treibt sie dazu, sich allein, hinter ihre Bildschirme zurückzuziehen. Sarac'h gewinnt 2004 den Grand Prix du disque du Télégramme. Danach hat Denez Prigent auf großen Bühnen gesungen. Das sind zum Beispiel das Stade de France (im Rahmen von St. Patrick), das Paléo Festival Nyon (Schweiz), der Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, die Rencontres Trans Musicales in China, das Theater der Stadt Paris, das Festival des Vieilles Charrues (große Bühne), das Casino de Paris, das Theater Rozrywki in Polen, das Stimmen-Festival (Deutschland), das antike römische Theater von Vienne und das Theater auf Teneriffa (Kanarische Inseln). |
G;|Graf Ernst Friedrich Herbert zu Münster, auch von Münster, (* 1. März 1766 in Osnabrück; † 20. Mai 1839 in Hannover) war ein deutscher Staatsmann und Politiker im Dienste des Vereinigten Königreiches und des Hauses Hannover.  Herkunft, Familie Ernst zu Münster entstammte dem alten westfälischen Adelsgeschlecht von Münster und wurde als Sohn des fürstbischöflichen Hofmarschalls Georg Ludwig Dietrich von Münster (bis 1792 auch von Mönster) und dessen zweiter Ehefrau Eleonore von Grothaus geboren, der neben seinem Stammsitz Surenburg aus erster Ehe über das Gut Ledenburg bei Osnabrück verfügte und bis zum Verkauf von Surenburg an beiden Orten lebte. Sein Vater diente dem letzten Fürstbischof Prinz Friedrich August von Großbritannien und Irland, der bereits 1764 als Säugling und Mündel zum Bischof erhoben wurde. Hieraus resultierten die guten Beziehungen der Familie von Münster zum Haus Hannover. Die Familie wurde 1792 durch den Reichsvikar Kurfürst Karl Theodor von der Pfalz in den Grafenstand erhoben. Ausbildung Nach dem Schulbesuch des Philanthropinum in Dessau (1778–81) und der Ritterakademie zu Lüneburg (1781–84) immatrikulierte er sich zum Wintersemester 1784/85 zum Studium der Rechte an der Georg-August-Universität Göttingen. Diese hatte zum 50. Universitätsjubiläum bereits eine außerordentliche Reputation erreicht und wurde als Landesuniversität des Kurfürstentums Braunschweig-Lüneburg (Kurhannover) auch von den drei jüngsten Söhnen König Georgs III. besucht. Die Bekanntschaft mit den drei Welfenprinzen bestimmte das weitere Leben Münsters, der als Student an der Universität, auch in der Auseinandersetzung seines Studentenordens der Unitisten mit dem Orden der schwarzen Brüder, aus der Studentschaft herausragte. Während seines Studiums hörte er unter anderem bei Christian Gottlob Heyne und bei Johann Dominik Fiorillo. Erste Anstellung Nach dem Abschluss des Studiums im Juli 1787 trat er 1788 als Verwaltungsjurist in den Staatsdienst des Kurfürstentums Hannover in Hannover ein. Er verkehrte zu dieser Zeit auch am nahe gelegenen Braunschweiger Hof des Herzogs Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand von Braunschweig, der mit der Schwester des britischen Königs, Augusta, verheiratet war. Festigung der Beziehung zum Königshaus Er wurde 1791 zum Hof- und Kanzleirat in Hannover ernannt, erhielt aber bereits 1793 vom Hof aus London den Auftrag, seinen ehemaligen Göttinger Kommilitonen Prinz August von Hannover, den Herzog von Sussex, aus Rom abzuholen und von Italien nach London zu bringen. Dieser Auftrag verlangte ihm umso mehr Fingerspitzengefühl ab, als August sich in Rom heimlich mit Lady Augusta Murray, Tochter des John Murray, 4. Earl of Dunmore verehelicht hatte. Mit kriegsbedingter Reiseverzögerung wurde dieser Auftrag wohl zur Zufriedenheit des Hofes bis September abgewickelt, und Münster blieb für weitere vier Monate beim Hof auf Schloss Windsor. Die beiderseitigen Beziehungen festigten sich in dieser Zeit weiter. König Georg II. hatte befohlen, gegen seinen zweitjüngsten Sohn, der in London ein zweites Mal Lady Murray geheiratet hatte, wegen Verletzung der Regeln das Verfahren nach dem Royal Marriages Act von 1772 einzuleiten. Der Herzog von Sussex wurde 1794 erneut außer Landes gesandt, und zwar unter von Münsters Begleitung nach Italien, wo beide für die nächsten fünf Jahre an wechselnden Orten Kunst und Kultur des Landes studierten, aber auch an den Höfen Italiens Beziehungen pflegten. Beginn der politischen Laufbahn Münster kehrte 1798 ins Hannoversche zurück und wurde Kammerrat an der für das Kurfürstentum bedeutenden Domänenkammer. Im Jahr 1801 trat er mit einem diplomatischen Auftrag erstmals politisch hervor. Die deutschen Staaten suchten sich jeweils ihren territorialen Anteil aus der Säkularisation zu sichern, das Kurfürstentum Hannover hatte starke Interessen am Fürstbistum Osnabrück und am Fürstbistum Hildesheim, bei letzterem in starker Konkurrenz zu Preußen, dem an einer Herstellung einer Landverbindung zwischen Brandenburg und den rheinisch-westfälischen Landesteilen gelegen war. Die Hannoveraner suchten für ihr Interesse russische Unterstützung durch Zar Alexander I. in Sankt Petersburg. Mit Entsetzen berichtet er von dort über die vorangegangene Ermordung des Zaren Paul und das ihm entgegen gehaltene „Was wollen Sie?“ Der erfolgreiche Abschluss der Mission, zumindest, soweit es das Fürstbistum Osnabrück betrifft, fand zwar Eingang in den Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, aber das Kurfürstentum Hannover wurde im Zuge des Krieges zwischen England und Frankreich bereits 1803 von den Truppen Napoleons unter Mortier besetzt. Im Zuge dieser Krise blieb von Münster in Petersburg, wo er insbesondere zu österreichischen Diplomaten wichtige Kontakte knüpfen konnte. Aufstieg zum Minister - Zeit der Koalitionskriege bis zum Wiener Kongress Nach England zurückgekehrt, wurde er im Mai 1805 vom Kammerrat zum Kabinettsminister beim König ernannt. Zuvor hatte er den am 11. April zwischen England und Russland in London abgeschlossenen Vertrag vermittelt, der die Grundlage der 3. Koalition darstellte und als wesentlichen Inhalt auch die Rückeroberung des Kurfürstentums Hannover zum Gegenstand hatte. Nach dem Rückzug der Franzosen wurde der Herzog von Cambridge im Dezember 1805 zum militärischen Oberbefehlshaber Hannovers ernannt, während Münster die Zivilverwaltung übernehmen sollte. Dem kam Anfang 1806 jedoch Preußen zuvor, indem es Hannover in „administrative Verwahrung“ nahm, also besetzte. Dieser Besetzung folgte im November des Jahres 1806 die erneute durch die Franzosen. Während Hannover so in den nächsten Jahren zwischen Frankreich und dem Königreich Westphalen aufgeteilt wurde, schmiedeten die Kräfte der Koalition im Exil Zukunftspläne. Münster hielt zu fast allen Kontakt. Münster, der seine gefestigte Vertrauensbeziehung zum Haus Hannover am britischen Hofe hatte, entwickelte sich auf dieser Basis während der weiteren Koalitionskriege zu einem „Kontinuitätsbeamten“ in London, der die zahlreichen, sich oftmals abwechselnden Premierminister mit ihren Kabinetten überstand. Dabei waren es sicher auch seine Kenntnisse der Verhältnisse auf dem Kontinent und im verloren gegangenen Kurfürstentum, die ihn in dieser herausragenden Stellung über Jahrzehnte absicherten. Mit Gneisenau diskutierte er den Plan eines großen Welfenreiches in Norddeutschland als Gegengewicht zu Preußen und den Süddeutschen Staaten, aber auch zu den Niederlanden unter den Arbeitstiteln Austrasien und Nordgermanien, einen kontinentalen Küstenstaat zwischen Schelde und Elbe in mit England verbundener Sekundogenitur als loyalem Handelspartner. Diese Gedanken wurden jedoch durch Hardenberg 1813 Gneisenau gegenüber verworfen, da sie eine Provokation Österreichs beinhalteten. Die Krankheit des britischen Königs führte dazu, dass der Thronfolger und Prince of Wales die Regentschaft übernehmen musste. Zu Vormündern über das Privatvermögen des erkrankten Königs wurden von Münster und Sir Herbert Taylor gemeinsam bestellt. Auch unter der Regentschaft blieb Münster Kabinettsminister in London. Kurz vor dem Ausbruch des Krieges zwischen Frankreich und Russland 1811 knüpften er und Gneisenau Kontakte zu dem zwischenzeitlich ebenfalls in London eingetroffenen Herzog Friedrich Wilhelm von Braunschweig. Die zwischen den Diplomaten und Militärs im Exil erörterten Varianten beinhalteten auch die Teilung Deutschlands an der Mainlinie in eine preußische und eine österreichische Interessensphäre (Protektorat), was Lord Castlereagh ansatzweise nicht unplausibel erschienen sein soll. Die persönliche Politik von Münsters stand hingegen wohl eher unter dem Ziel der Wiederherstellung der alten Verfassung des Heiligen Römischen Reiches in modifizierter Form. Für die von ihm vertretenen Interessen kam die Diskussion mit der Konvention von Reichenbach vom 15. Juni 1813 zum Abschluss. Dieser Vertrag sicherte die Wiedereinsetzung beider Linien Braunschweig-Lüneburg und die Erweiterung Hannovers um 250.000 bis 300.000 Einwohner unter Einbeziehung des Hochstifts Hildesheim zu. 1814, während des Wiener Kongresses, heiratete er die Prinzessin Wilhelmine zu Schaumburg-Lippe. Pariser Frieden und Wiener Kongress Im Januar 1814 vertrat er England neben Castlereagh bei den Verhandlungen in Paris und blieb nach dem Abschluss des Ersten Pariser Friedens dort mit Abwicklungen befasst bis zum Juni des Jahres. Ab September nahm er dann als Bevollmächtigter des Regenten am Wiener Kongress teil. Hannover wurde von Minister Ernst von Hardenberg vertreten und England von Castlereagh. Münster nahm instruktionslos teil. Unter den Vertretern der der mittleren und kleinen Staaten des Kongresses war von Münster einer der herausragenden. Für das Haus Hannover war er von den Verhandlungergebnissen her sogar höchst effektiv: Hannover wurde zunächst einmal von der geographischen Größe her mit den „Süddeutschen Erhebungen“ wie Württemberg „automatisch“ ebenfalls zum Königreich erhoben. Das Staatsgebiet wurde entsprechend den vorherigen Absprachen um 1/5 der vorherigen Fläche oder aber 250 Tausend Einwohner erweitert. Auf reichspolitischer Ebene sah von Münster die alles gefährdende Polarität zwischen Preußen und Österreich vor der Bühne der vielfältigen Eitelkeiten deutscher Kleinstaatherrscher und hoffte auf die Niederlande (vertreten durch den ihm wohl bekannten hessischen Staatsmann und Politiker Hans von Gagern) als dritte Kraft in der Mitte Deutschlands und den Prinzen von Oranien als einen Hessen-Nassau verbundenen Herrscher. Zusammengefasst: von Münster sah besorgt die zukünftigen Ambitionen Preußens und war zugleich nicht nur unsicher hinsichtlich der Möglichkeiten und Grenzen Österreichs. Russland genoss unter seinem Zar Alexander I. nicht die Sympathien Londons, Alexander hatte jedoch das erheblich größere Hannover bereits seinem Verwandten, dem Herzog von Oldenburg zugedacht. Vor diesem Hintergrund musste von Münster zunächst hinsichtlich der möglichen Einverleibung Sachsens durch Preußen „umdenken“, durch eine Teilung Sachsens würde für ein wiedererstandenes Hannover der diplomatische Handlungsspielraum im Machtgefüge der kleineren und mittleren deutschen Staaten größer werden. Insofern verfolgte von Münster auf dem Wiener Kongress eine Politik, die von der Abneigung gegen eine Hegemonie Preußens insbesondere in (Nordwest-)Deutschland, sowie auf europäischer Ebene machtpolitisch von einer Ablehnung der Koalition zwischen Preußen und Russland bestimmt war. Hier trat der den Deutschen Bund schwächende Konflikt zwischen den deutschen Großmächten Preußen und Österreich deutlich hervor, der die weitere Entwicklung des 19. Jahrhunderts prägen sollte. Die Durchsetzung der eigenständigen hannoverschen Interessen des britischen Königshauses war sicherlich die bedeutendste der diplomatischen Leistungen von Münsters. Vormundschaft und Testamentsvollstreckung im Herzogtum Braunschweig Der schwarze Herzog Friedrich Wilhelm von Braunschweig hatte vor seinem Tod 1815 in der Schlacht bei Quatre-Bras seinen Schwager, den britischen Thronfolger, zum Vormund seiner Kinder Karl und Wilhelm bestellt. Die Verwaltung seiner Vermögensangelegenheiten hatte er in diesem Testament auf Ernst zu Münster, Lord Liverpool und George Canning übertragen. Die vormundschaftliche Regierung des Herzogtums Braunschweig erfolgte nicht über das Königliche Ministerium in Hannover, sondern direkt durch von Münster in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Geheimen Ratskollegium in Braunschweig unter Graf Gebhard von der Schulenburg-Wolfsburg, nach dessen Tod 1818 unter Graf Johann Ernst von Alvensleben. Der hannoversche Diplomat Friedrich Wilhelm Alexander von Linsingen wurde als Erzieher der beiden Prinzen eingesetzt. Als Herzog Karl 18 Jahre alt wurde, beanspruchte er von seinem Vormund und seinen Testamentsvollstreckern die Regierungsmacht in Braunschweig, und es entbrannte ein Streit über das richtige Alter hierzu: 18 oder 21 Jahre, dies allerdings vor dem Hintergrund, dass man Herzog Karl II. entweder noch nicht oder überhaupt nicht für regierungsfähig hielt. Fürst Metternich, der in Wien die Bekanntschaft des jungen Herzogs gemacht hatte, machte seinen Einfluss geltend, so dass der Vormund dann das vollendete 19. Lebensjahr für die Thronmündigkeit Karls anerkannte. Dieser begann unmittelbar nach Übernahme des Throns in Braunschweig eine Kampagne, die auch von Münster beschädigte und zur Abfassung von Rechtfertigungsschriften veranlasste, schon um den in die Kampagne einbezogenen König Georg IV. zu verteidigen und zu entlasten. Der Herzog erwiderte hierauf seinerseits mit einer erneuten Schmähschrift und forderte von Münster zum Duell. Die Forderung ließ er dem Grafen durch den Pferdeauktionator Richard Tattersall aus London übermitteln, was nach dem Comment der damaligen Zeit durchaus einer weiteren Beleidigung gleichkam. Münster wurde die Annahme der Forderung durch den britischen König untersagt. Die Angelegenheit eskalierte, es kam noch zu einer weiteren Forderung eines Forstmeisters an von Münster, mit der dann nicht nur die Regierungen Preußens und Österreichs sondern auch die Bundesversammlung des Deutschen Bundes befasst waren. Der Aufstand der Braunschweiger Bevölkerung gegen den verhassten Diamantenherzog beendete auch für von Münster den öffentlichen Teil dieser unangenehmen Affäre. Die Restauration des hannoverschen Staatswesens Nach dem Wiener Kongress oblag es von Münster als hannoverschem Kabinettsminister mit Dienstsitz in London, die inneren Strukturen des neuen Königreichs zu stabilisieren. Dabei stand er schon aus seiner „erzwungenen“ Londoner Zeit in einer starken persönlichen Rivalität zu dem General und Begründer der King’s German Legion Friedrich von der Decken. Weiter unterstützte er mit Rat und Tat die Regentschaft des Prinzen von Wales im Hannover benachbarten Braunschweig. Im Königreich Hannover stand der Regent mit seinen liberalen Grundpositionen und dem Kabinett unter Führung von August Wilhelm Rehberg gegen die auf Restauration gerichteten Interessen des hannoverschen Adels, der sich aus seiner Minderheit heraus unter Führung von Münsters Neffen von Schele zunehmend organisierte. Diese Adelsfraktion verstand es, durch Intrige und Kabinettsjustiz mit Rehberg einen qualifizierten Beamten in Widerspruch zu Münster zu setzen und auszuschalten. Der Weg für die Zweikammerverfassung vom Dezember 1819 war frei. Münster hielt politisch weiter Kontakt zu Metternich und besuchte diesen jährlich auf Schloss Johannisberg im Rheingau. So trafen sich die beiden auch 1819 in Karlsbad zur Konferenz. Das Verhältnis zwischen Münster und Metternich verschlechterte sich trotz Einigkeit in Fragen der Karlsbader Beschlüsse in den Folgejahren. Die Gründe hierfür lagen in der positiven Haltung Metternichs zur Person des Herzogs Karl von Braunschweig. Im Königreich Hannover wurde ab 1820 die Staatsorganisation nicht nur an die territoriale Neuordnung aufgrund der Gebietszuwächse infolge des Wiener Kongresses angepasst, es fand gleichzeitig auch eine straffende Zentralisierung der Verwaltung statt. Domänenkammer, Landdrosteien und Ämter wurden 1822/23 neu geschaffen. Der Machtmittelpunkt befand sich allerdings nicht in der Stadt Hannover, sondern in der Person des Kabinettsministers Münster in London. Den Umstand, dass Hannover seit 1815 Küstenstaat geworden war, wusste das Kabinett Münster nicht zu nutzen. Der Hafen an der Unterweser wurde 1827 an Bremen verkauft. Zoll-, geld- und handelspolitisch gelang der Regierung offensichtlich auch deshalb wenig, weil sie ständig unter dem Zwang stand, sich der Umarmung des doppelten Nachbarn Preußen zu entziehen. Münster personifizierte zunehmend ein ungeliebetes System, und Ende 1830 kursierten Flugschriften gegen ihn persönlich im ganzen Land, die bei der Bevölkerung begierig aufgenommen und in Umlauf gehalten wurden. Im Anschluss an die Julirevolution des Jahres 1830 in Paris kam es dann Anfang 1831 zu Unruhen im Königreich Hannover. Der Osteroder Rechtsanwalt Georg Friedrich König fand mit seiner Schrift Anklage des Ministeriums Münster vor der öffentlichen Meinung große Resonanz. Unruhen entstanden insbesondere an der Universität Göttingen. Die Universität und die Bevölkerung forderten eine neue Verfassung, den Rücktritt des Kabinetts Münster, und Ruhe und Ordnung mussten durch das Militär wieder hergestellt werden. In England war zwischenzeitig am 24. Juni 1830 König Wilhelm IV. dem von-Münster-Förderer König Georg IV. auf den Thron gefolgt. In der Konsequenz wurde der konziliantere Herzog von Cambridge, der während der Unruhen das Land bereist hatte, zum Vizekönig von Hannover ernannt und Graf Münster nach 26 ununterbrochenen Dienstjahren am 12. Februar 1831 als Minister entlassen. |
G;|Karen Blixen, eigentlich Karen Christence von Blixen-Finecke, geborene Dinesen, (* 17. April 1885 in Rungstedlund bei Kopenhagen; † 7. September 1962 ebenda) war eine dänische Schriftstellerin und 17 Jahre lang eine Kaffeefarmerin in Kenia. Ihr Pseudonym auf dem deutschen Buchmarkt ist meist Tania Blixen. Ihre englischsprachigen Bücher erschienen meist unter dem Pseudonym Isak Dinesen. Karen Blixen wurde in dem Film Jenseits von Afrika von Meryl Streep dargestellt.  Kindheit und Jugend Karen Christence Dinesen wurde als zweite und mittlere Tochter in eine Unitarier-Familie hineingeboren, die seit 1879, als das Gut gekauft wurde, in Rungstedlund nahe Kopenhagen am Hafen lebte, an der Ostküste von Seeland, am Öresund in Dänemark. Die Familie pflegte Karen Dinesen mit ihrem ungeliebten Spitznamen „Tanne“ zu rufen, ihr kindersprachlicher Ausdruck des Namens Karen. Ihr Vater war der Offizier, Schriftsteller und Politiker Wilhelm Dinesen; ihre Mutter war Ingeborg Westenholz. In einem wohlbehüteten Elternhaus wuchs sie mit weiteren vier Geschwistern auf: Inger Benedicte (Ea), Ellen Alvilde (Elle), Thomas Fasti und Anders Runsti. Ihr jüngerer Bruder Thomas Dinesen hat sie später in Afrika besucht und unterstützt. Geprägt waren diese Jahre vor allem durch eine starre, bürgerliche Erziehung. Die drei Mädchen entwickelten ihr künstlerisches Talent, Karen Dinesen sprachlich und bildnerisch, die beiden Schwestern musikalisch. Karen Dinesen ging hier langsam auf Distanz zur Kirche und entwickelte Widerstand gegen die streng religiöse Lebensweise der Eltern, besonders der Mutter. Der Vater Wilhelm Dinesen war im August 1872 in die USA nach Wisconsin gereist und hatte bis Dezember 1873 in der Gemeinschaft des indigenen Indianervolks der Chippewa gelebt. Nach erfolgreicher Integration in den Volksstamm war er hier zum ersten Mal Vater geworden. Aber noch vor der Geburt dieser Tochter reiste er wieder nach Dänemark zurück. 1895 beging der Vater, dem Karen Dinesen sehr nahestand, Selbstmord, was einen schweren Schlag für das zehnjährige Kind bedeutete. Wilhelm Dinesen hatte sich erhängt, nachdem ihm die Diagnose Syphilis mitgeteilt worden war. Karen besuchte Kunstschulen in Kopenhagen (Fräulein Sode’s Kunstschule und die Königlich Dänische Kunstakademie), Paris und Rom. Sie hatte als Kind häufig Kontakt zu ihrem späteren schwedischen Ehemann Bror von Blixen-Finecke. Er war der Sohn von Baron Frederik von Blixen-Finecke und seiner Frau Clara von Blixen-Finecke und der Zwillingsbruder von Hans von Blixen-Finecke (1886–1917). Clara war die Schwester des größten dänischen Landbesitzers, des Grafen Mogens Frijs, eigentlich Mogens Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs von Schloss Frijsenborg. Mogens’ Mutter wiederum war die Tante mütterlicherseits von Wilhelm Dinesen. Somit waren Brors Mutter und Karens Vater Cousins. Studium und Schreiben Nach Ende ihrer Schulzeit nahm sie 1903 das Studium der Malerei an der Königlich Dänischen Kunstakademie in Kopenhagen auf und begann zu schreiben. 1907, ein Jahr, nachdem sie ihr Studium abgeschlossen hatte, veröffentlichte sie einige Kurzgeschichten unter dem Pseudonym Osceola, nach einem damals weitgehend unbekannten Repräsentanten der Seminolen. Es wird vermutet, dass Karen zu diesem Namen durch ihren weitgereisten Vater Wilhelm Dinesen inspiriert wurde. Aber Osceola war nicht ihr einziges Pseudonym. Karen Blixen hatte viele unterschiedliche Pseudonyme und schien fast in diesen zu leben (weitere Pseudonyme: siehe unten). 1909 verliebte sie sich in den schwedischen Baron Hans von Blixen-Finecke, einen Sohn der Cousine ihres Vaters. Diese Liebe blieb unerwidert. Am 23. Dezember 1912 verlobte sich Karen stattdessen mit Hans’ Bruder, ihrem Halbcousin Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke auf Näsbyholm in Schweden. Die beiden beschlossen, gemeinsam nach Kenia auszuwandern und eine Milchfarm bei Nairobi zu betreiben, finanziert durch Karens bürgerliche Familie. Karen floh damit aus der Enge des bürgerlichen Elternhauses, um sich mit ihrem Mann außerhalb Dänemarks eine Existenz aufzubauen. Mit Bror in Kenia Bror fuhr nach Kenia voraus und kaufte 1913 im heutigen Karen (einem Vorort Nairobis, damals Britisch-Ostafrika) die 800 Hektar große Mbagathi-Farm am Fuße der Ngong-Berge südlich von Nairobi. Die Finanzierung der Farm erfolgte größtenteils mit Geldern der Familie Dinesen, denn Bror war pleite. Das alte Mbagathi-Farmhaus war von Denys Finch Hatton entworfen worden. Im Dezember 1913 kam Karen mit dem Schiff von Neapel nach Mombasa nach, wo Bror sie abholte und sie am 14. Januar 1914 heirateten. Auf dem Schiff hatte Karen den deutschen Oberstleutnant Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, den späteren Kommandeur der kaiserlichen Schutztruppe in Deutsch-Ostafrika, kennengelernt und mit ihm die Lieferung von mehreren Pferden vereinbart, einen Plan, den der Ausbruch des ersten Weltkriegs am 5. August 1914 durchkreuzte. Lettow-Vorbeck war am 14. Januar 1914 in Mombasa ihr Trauzeuge, bevor er mit dem Schiff weiter in die deutsche Kolonie reiste. Später trug das zu dem Verdacht der britischen Siedler bei, Karen Blixen sei deutschfreundlich. Als Karen und Bror die neue Farm erreichten, musste sie feststellen, dass ihr Mann keine Milch-, sondern eine Kaffeefarm gekauft hatte, deren Anbaugebiete ungewöhnlich hoch lagen. Zu dieser Zeit galt es noch als unmöglich, in einer Höhe von etwa 1700 m Kaffee anzubauen. Doch Karen versuchte das Unmögliche. Später würde sie diese Zeit beschreiben und den Roman Afrika, dunkel lockende Welt mit den Worten beginnen „Ich hatte eine Farm in Afrika am Fuße der Ngong-Berge ...“ – so beginnt auch der Film Jenseits von Afrika. Karen Blixen nutzte die Zeit ihrer Jahre in Kenia auch, um immer wieder Bilder zu malen, insbesondere Porträts ihrer neuen Nachbarn. Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke, obwohl offiziell Leiter der Farm, zeigte kein großes Interesse an der Landwirtschaft, sondern gab sich lieber den Großwildjagden und den damit verbundenen Safaris hin. Ähnlich wie sein „Nachfolger“ Denys Finch Hatton beschreibt Karen Bror als einen äußerst charmanten, witzigen und liebenswerten Mann. In ihren Briefen an die Familie berichtete sie von Krankheiten und hob die Qualitäten des Barons als hingebungsvoller Krankenpfleger und guter Masseur hervor. Der Kleinkrieg während des Ersten Weltkriegs entlang der Grenze zu Tanganjika entzog den Farmen Arbeitskräfte und Nachschub. Karen unternahm mehrere Versorgungsfahrten zu den Truppen im Grenzgebiet. Zwischen 1915 und 1918 wurde Kenia von einer großen Trockenperiode überzogen. 1917 stoppten die Briten die Kaffeeeinfuhr, und Krankheiten brachen unter den Rinderherden aus. Unter diesen extremen Bedingungen litten in dieser Zeit viele Farmen Kenias – viele waren erst gerade gegründet worden. Bror ging völlig sorglos mit dem Geld um – meist dem seiner Frau bzw. deren Familie. Es wird kolportiert, dass Bror geglaubt haben soll, eine Rechnung sei bezahlt, wenn er sie unterschrieben hatte. Diese Eigenschaften führten aber auch dazu, dass er ein klassischer „womanizer“ („Weiberheld“) war und ein Freund der Prostitution. 1915 erkrankten er und Karen an Syphilis. In Nairobi wurde Karen mit Quecksilber behandelt; 1915 verließ sie erstmals Kenia, um sich in Dänemark mit dem von Paul Ehrlich neu entdeckten arsenhaltigen Arsphenamin behandeln zu lassen. Bror fuhr ihr nach. In Kopenhagen wurde sie drei Monate lang stationär behandelt; dort gelang es, die Krankheit so weit zu beherrschen, dass sie nicht mehr ansteckend war. Jedoch sollte Karen Blixen ihr restliches Leben lang unter chronischen Schmerzen in Folge der Syphilis-Infektion bzw. der Schwermetallvergiftung als Nebenwirkung der Quecksilbertherapie leiden. 1916 kamen beide nach Kenia zurück. Sie gründeten abermals mit dem Geld der Dinesens die „Karen Coffee Corporation“, vergrößerten Mbagathi auf 2.200 Hektar und kauften eine zweite – gleich große – Farm in den White Highlands. Für kenianische Verhältnisse war das eine relativ normale Farm, gab es doch Latifundien, die 100.000 Hektar groß waren. Noch heute existieren im Laikipia District solch große Farmen. 1917 zogen die Blixens auf dem zugekauften Farmgelände in das nächste Haus, „Mbogani“, das heutige Museum. Mbogani war 1912 von dem Schweden Åke Sjögren erbaut worden. 1985 wurden in Mbagathi (dem ersten Haus), das heute eine Milchfarm ist und Mama Ngina gehört, die Szenen in Jenseits von Afrika gedreht, die in Karen Blixens zweitem Haus Mbogani spielen. 1919 fuhren die beiden nach Dänemark bzw. Schweden. Bror kehrte im März 1920 nach Kenia zurück. Vorher bat er Karen schriftlich um die Trennung. Karen willigte nicht ein, aber 1921 trennten sie sich gegen Karens Willen. Bror wurde 1921 von Aage Westenholz, Karens Onkel und Vorsitzender der Karen Coffee Corporation, als Manager entlassen. Karen lebte ein Jahr lang mit ihrer Mutter auf Rungstedlund. Sie litt an Spanischer Grippe, Blutvergiftung und ständigen Schmerzattacken. 1925 wurde die Ehe geschieden. Farm-Managerin 1920 kehrte sie mit ihrem Bruder Thomas Dinesen (1892–1979) nach Kenia zurück, der das finanzielle Chaos der Farm ordnen sollte. Mit Hilfe ihres Bruders übernahm sie mutig, aber erfolglos das Management der Kaffeefarm. Am 2. März 1922 kehrte Thomas Dinesen nach Dänemark zurück. Am 3. November 1924 kamen Thomas Dinesen und Mutter Ingeborg für zwei Monate auf Besuch. Im Januar 1925 fuhren die drei zurück nach Dänemark. Dort versuchte Karen Kontakte herzustellen, um ihre Werke veröffentlichen zu können, unter anderem mit Georg Brandes, dem führenden dänischen Kritiker. Am 1. Februar 1926 kehrte Karen auf ihre Farm zurück. Ihre Krise versuchte Karen in langen und intensiven Briefen an ihren Bruder zu bewältigen. 1927, am 23. Januar, kam ihre Mutter erneut nach Kenia und blieb mehr als drei Monate lang auf der Farm. 1929 wurde ihre Mutter ernsthaft krank, und Karen weilte vom 18. Mai bis 25. Dezember in Rungstedlund. Sie besuchte die Finch Hattons in England. Thomas Dinesens Buch Niemandsland, Erinnerungen an die französische Front im Ersten Weltkrieg, an dem er teilgenommen hat, erschien auf Dänisch. Die Beziehung zu Denys Finch Hatton Am 15. April 1918 hatte Karen im Muthaiga-Club in Nairobi ihre spätere große Liebe, den britischen Armee-Offizier und Großwildjäger Denys Finch Hatton, kennengelernt. Nach ihrer Rückkehr aus Dänemark nahm sie 1920 eine intensive Liebesbeziehung zu Denys auf. 1923 brannte die Kaffeefabrik vollständig nieder, und Thomas kehrte nach Dänemark zurück. Nun war sie völlig allein auf sich gestellt, denn Bror war ständig auf Safari unterwegs. Ab 1924 begann Denys in Mbogani bei Karen zu übernachten, wenn er nach Nairobi zurückkehrte. 1924 hatte sie eine Fehlgeburt von Denys. Im Januar 1925 wurde die Scheidung zwischen Bror und Karen ausgesprochen, und Karen ging wieder für ein Jahr nach Dänemark. Nach der Scheidung zog Denys ganz bei ihr in „Mbogani“ ein. 1926 war Karen Blixen erneut schwanger. Denys hatte Schwierigkeiten sich vorzustellen, Vater zu werden und Verantwortung zu übernehmen. Am 21. Mai 1926 sandte er Karen aus England ein Telegramm bezüglich „Daniels“ (das Codewort für ein Kind): “Reference your cable and my reply please do as you like about Daniel as I should welcome him if I could offer partnership but this is impossible STOP You will I know consider your mother’s views Denys.” Karen hatte wieder eine Fehlgeburt. 1927 war das harmonischste Jahr, in dem Denys nach dem Tod seines Freundes Berkeley Cole endlich viel Zeit mit Karen verbrachte. Karen Blixen führte ein offenes Haus mit berühmter Küche. Am 9. November 1928 dinierte der damalige Prince of Wales auf seiner Safari in Ostafrika, deren Leiter Denys war, mit Karen, Denys, Bror und der schwangeren Beryl Markham in Mbogani. Die neue Baroness Blixen (Bror hatte mittlerweile Cockie Birkbeck geheiratet) machte Karens gesellschaftliche Situation in Kenia kompliziert. Das Dinner mit dem Prinzen, das Denys arrangiert hatte, sollte Karens Stellung stärken. Andererseits wurde die Beziehung von Karen und Denys besonders durch Denys’ Entscheidung belastet, Bror mit auf die Safari mit dem Prinzen zu nehmen. Die Beziehung zu Denys zerbrach 1929. Im Mai 1931 flog Denys in sein Ferienhaus an der Küste von Mombasa, wo er auch schon mit Karen gewesen war. Auf dem Rückflug landete er in Voi, heute ein wichtiger Haltepunkt auf der Verbindungsstrecke Nairobi–Mombasa und im Tsavo East National Park gelegen. Gemeinsam mit seinem Somali-Helfer Hamisi suchte er Elefanten aus der Luft. Am 14. Mai 1931 startete er mit Hamisi erneut zu einem Erkundungsflug, der sein letzter werden sollte. Der Motor versagte, und beide kamen beim Absturz ums Leben. Finch Hattons Leichnam wurde trotz der Entfremdung an Karen Blixen übergeben, und sie beerdigte ihn im Kreise seiner Freunde in den Ngong Hills, dort, wo er gern begraben sein wollte und wohin sie von ihrem Farmhaus blicken konnte. Verkauf der Farm 1931 musste Karen Blixen nach 17 Jahren Ertraglosigkeit und weniger unter dem Druck der Weltwirtschaftskrise (oder einem Brand auf der Farm) ihre Plantage aufgeben. Ihr Werk in Kenia war damit beendet. Allerdings konnte sie dafür sorgen, dass „ihre“ Kikuyu auf einem Stück Land wohnen bleiben dürfen. Sie verkaufte die Farm an Remi Martin, einen Geschäftsmann aus Nairobi, der nichts mit der namensähnlichen französischen Cognac-Marke Rémy Martin zu tun hat. Remi Martin parzellierte ihr Land und verkaufte es an wohlhabende Siedler, die dort große Villen oder kleinere Stadtfarmen errichten. Bis heute ist das Land um ihre Farm, das ihren Namen „Karen“ trägt, ein eleganter Wohnort von Nairobi geblieben. Rückkehr nach Dänemark Nach Dänemark auf den Familiensitz Rungstedlund (etwa 20 Kilometer nördlich von Kopenhagen) zurückzukehren, fiel Karen Blixen nicht leicht, denn sie hatte kein gutes Verhältnis zu ihrer Familie. Auch musste sie sich mit ihrer Rückkehr wieder der Familie unterordnen und sich in Abhängigkeit von ihr begeben. Auf dem Familiensitz, der bis ins Jahr 1680 zurück datiert, schrieb sie meist im „Ewalds-Zimmer“, das nach dem von ihr verehrten Schriftsteller Johannes Ewald benannt war, der dort von 1773 bis 1775 gelebt und einige seiner Hauptwerke, darunter die Autobiografie Leben und Ansichten, verfasst hat. 1934 veröffentlichte sie Seven Gothic Tales auf Englisch und gewann damit 1939 einen Preis, den Tagea Brandt Rejselegat. 1937 erschien Out of Africa in London. Während des Zweiten Weltkriegs, als die deutsche Armee Dänemark besetzt hielt, schrieb sie ihren einzigen großen Roman The Angelic Avengers, der als Allegorie des Untergangs des Naziregimes interpretiert wird. In den 1940er und 1950er Jahren widmete sie sich ganz den Erzählungen in der Tradition der Geschichtenerzähler. Die bekannteste dieser Erzählungen aus jener Zeit ist Babettes Fest, die 1987 verfilmt und 1988 mit einem Oscar ausgezeichnet wurde. Eine andere der Geschichten, eigentlich ein Märchen, An Immortal Story, in der ein alternder Mann seine Jugend zurückkaufen will, wurde 1968 von Orson Welles verfilmt. In den 1950er Jahren wurde ihr das Schreiben wegen ihrer schwer angeschlagenen Gesundheit unmöglich, doch sie sprach noch in verschiedenen Radiosendungen. Viele ihrer Werke erschienen postum. Im Alter von 77 Jahren starb sie auf dem Familiensitz. Rungstedlund ist seit 1991 ein Museum, das von der (von der Familie begründeten) „Rungstedlund-Stiftung“ betrieben wird. |
G;Vorlage:Infobox Formel-1-Fahrer/Wartung/Alte Parameter Nick Lars Heidfeld (* 10. Mai 1977 in Mönchengladbach) ist ein deutscher Automobilrennfahrer. Er trat von 2000 bis 2011 in der Formel 1 an. Die meisten Rennen absolvierte er für den in Hinwil beheimateten Rennstall Sauber, der einige Zeit als BMW Sauber antrat. Sein größter Erfolg war neben einer Pole-Position und insgesamt acht zweiten Plätzen der fünfte Platz in der Gesamtwertung 2007. Heidfeld ist zudem der Fahrer mit den meisten Podestplätzen (13) in der Geschichte der Formel 1 (Stand 2015), der dabei kein Rennen gewann. Seit 2012 fährt er in der FIA-Langstrecken-Weltmeisterschaft (WEC) für Rebellion Racing. Außerdem trat er 2014 für Venturi in der FIA-Formel-E-Meisterschaft an, seit 2015 fährt er für Mahindra Racing. Heidfeld wurde 1997 deutscher Formel-3- sowie 1999 Formel-3000-Meister.   Anfänge im Motorsport Als Fünfjähriger begann Heidfeld seine Rennsportkarriere, als er in einem Verein mit seinen Brüdern (Tim, Sven) an Motocross-Rennen teilnahm. Nach einem Unfall, bei dem sein Bein zwischen Schutzblech und weiter laufendem Rad eingeklemmt blieb, untersagten ihm seine Eltern den Sport. Denn beinahe hätte er einen Wadenmuskel verloren. Kartsport Schon als Sechsjähriger wäre er nach eigenem Bekunden gerne Kart gefahren. Doch Karts waren für ihn zu groß: „Ich war aber zu klein. An den Leihkartbahnen gab es immer solche Stangen: Wer darunter durchlaufen konnte, durfte nicht fahren.“ Nach einem Ausflug zum Nürburgring überzeugte er seine Eltern 1984, es noch einmal versuchen zu dürfen. Eine Decke und zwei Reifen halfen den Abstand zum Lenkrad zu überbrücken. Als er dann noch seinen Vater Wolfgang überholte und weit hinter sich hielt, versprach man ihm den Kauf eines eigenen Karts, das dann 1985 den Sprung in den Motorsport bedeutete. Im Kartclub in Kerpen-Manheim trat er unter anderem auch gegen Michael und Ralf Schumacher an. Eine WDR-Dokumentation jener Jahre zeigt den sehr kindlichen Nick noch auf dem Schoß von Mutter Schumacher sitzend, die damals das Clubheim betrieb. Während dieser Zeit nahm er vermehrt an Clubmeisterschaften sowie nationalen und internationalen Rennen teil. Anfänge im Motorsport 1994 wechselte Heidfeld in die Monoposto-Klasse Formel Ford 1600. Er gewann bereits in seiner ersten Saison acht von neun Rennen und sicherte sich damit überlegen den Titel. Auch in der nächsten Stufe in der Formel Ford 1800 gewann er 1995 die Meisterschaft. Heidfeld wechselte in die nächsthöhere Klasse, die Formel 3, in der er 1996 drei Rennen gewann und Dritter des Championats wurde. Beim internationalen Formel-3-Masters in Macau erzielte er die Pole-Position und den Laufsieg. 1997 gewann schließlich den deutschen Formel-3-Titel, der ihm die Unterstützung von Mercedes-Benz einbrachte. Dank dieser Unterstützung testete Heidfeld bereits im Dezember 1997 erstmals einen Formel-1-Wagen des McLaren-Mercedes-Teams und wechselte in die internationale Formel-3000-Meisterschaft, in der er zwei Jahre für das Juniorteam von McLaren, West Competition, antrat. Nebenbei testete er weiterhin sporadisch in der Formel 1. In seiner ersten Formel-3000-Saison hatte Heidfeld nach drei Siegen vor dem Finale gute Titelchancen. Beim letzten Rennen wurde jedoch seine Pole-Position wegen eines Fehlers seines Teams nicht anerkannt, sodass er von ganz hinten starten musste. Stattdessen gewann der Kolumbianer Juan Pablo Montoya die Formel-3000-Europameisterschaft. 1999 entschied Heidfeld dann mit vier Siegen und einer Rekordpunktzahl die Meisterschaft für sich. Dabei erreichte er mehr Punkte als der Vizemeister Jason Watt und der Drittplatzierte Gonzalo Rodríguez zusammen. Da McLaren-Teamchef Ron Dennis dem jungen Deutschen kein Cockpit in der Formel 1 anbieten konnte, unterschrieb Heidfeld beim französischen Formel-1-Team Prost Grand Prix, das von Ex-Weltmeister Alain Prost geführt wurde. Formel 1 Prost (2000) In seinem ersten Formel-1-Jahr blieb Heidfeld punktlos, was seinem Ruf als schnelles Nachwuchstalent angesichts des schweren, verwindungsschwachen Chassis seines Rennfahrzeugs und des kaum besseren Auftretens seines erfahrenen Teamkollegen Jean Alesi aber kaum schadete. Seine beste Platzierung war der achte Platz beim Großen Preis von Monaco, für den es aber zu dieser Zeit noch keinen Punkt gab. Da Prost Ende der Saison die Werksmotoren von Peugeot verlor, schaute sich Heidfeld frühzeitig nach Alternativen um und wechselte zur Saison 2001 zum Schweizer Sauber-Team. Sauber (2001–2003) Schon bei Tests im Winter war zu erkennen, dass Sauber ein erheblich besseres Auto gebaut hatte als Prost im Vorjahr. Heidfeld konnte regelmäßig punkten und errang beim Rennen in Brasilien seinen ersten Podestplatz. Am Ende der Saison lag er auf dem achten Rang der Fahrerwertung. Im September 2001 kam es zu einer vorübergehenden Verstimmung mit seinem einstigen Förderer Mercedes-Benz, da McLaren sich entschieden hatte, Heidfelds Teamkollegen Kimi Räikkönen für 2002 zu verpflichten. Der junge Finne fuhr zwar weniger Punkte ein als Heidfeld, überzeugte aber aufgrund seiner im Verhältnis zu seiner Erfahrung außerordentlichen Leistungen vor allem Ron Dennis. Nach der Saison 2001, in der Sauber den vierten Rang in der Konstrukteurswertung erringen konnte, waren die beiden folgenden Jahre weniger erfolgreich. 2002 fuhr Heidfeld an der Seite des Formel-1-Neulings Felipe Massa, gegen den er sich teamintern durchsetzen konnte, die Konkurrenzfähigkeit seines Wagens hielt sich aber in Grenzen. In der Formel-1-Saison 2003 fuhr Heidfeld neben dem ebenfalls aus Mönchengladbach stammenden Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Nachdem die Ergebnisse sich aber nicht merklich besserten, entschied sich Sauber die beiden für die Saison 2004 auszutauschen. Jordan (2004) Heidfeld nahm ein Angebot des Jordan-Teams für die Saison 2004 an. Er kam in diesem Jahr nur zweimal in die Punkte und landete am Ende mit 3 Punkten auf dem 18. Platz in der Gesamtwertung. Sein bestes Resultat war ein siebter Platz beim Großen Preis von Monaco. Williams (2005) Zum Jahreswechsel 2004/2005 war er als zweiter Stammpilot bei Williams im Gespräch. Da ihm einige Experten, wie zum Beispiel Hans-Joachim Stuck zwar rennfahrerische Kompetenz zugesprochen, aber jegliches persönliches Profil abgesprochen hatten, kam dies überraschend. Lediglich der frühere Formel-1-Pilot und BMW-Motorsportdirektor Gerhard Berger sprach sich für Heidfeld aus. Heidfeld musste, um bei Williams fahren zu dürfen, direkte Vergleichstests gegen den vorherigen Testpiloten Antonio Pizzonia bestreiten, den er dabei aber klar übertreffen konnte. Ende Januar 2005 verkündete Frank Williams offiziell, dass Heidfeld zweiter Stammfahrer neben Mark Webber sein würde. Von BMW-Motosportchef Mario Theissen bekam Heidfeld im Zusammenhang mit seinem öffentlichen Auftreten ein großes Lob: „Nick hat einen beeindruckenden Job gemacht. Er hat sich das zweite Cockpit mit seiner souveränen Vorstellung verdient.“ Im Laufe der Saison 2005 fuhr Heidfeld auf einem Level mit Webber. Als Saisonhöhepunkte gelten sein zweiter Platz in Monaco und seine erste Pole-Position auf dem Nürburgring. Ab dem Großen Preis von Italien wurde Heidfeld durch Pizzonia ersetzt. Anfangs konnte Heidfeld wegen eines Trainingsunfalls nicht starten, später musste er wegen einer weiteren Verletzung pausieren. BMW Sauber (2006–2009) Nachdem sich BMW als Motorenlieferant von Williams getrennt und entschieden hatte, durch die Übernahme des Sauber-Rennstalls ein eigenes Team aufzubauen, wurde auch Heidfeld an Bord geholt. Neben ihm wurde für die Saison 2006 Ex-Weltmeister Jacques Villeneuve verpflichtet, der jedoch nicht überzeugen konnte und im Laufe der Saison durch den bisherigen Testfahrer des Teams, Robert Kubica, ersetzt wurde. Heidfeld etablierte sich mit seinem Team im Mittelfeld und konnte regelmäßig Punkte sammeln. Für die Saison 2007 wurde das Ziel formuliert, sich unter die Top-Vier der Konstrukteurswertung zu schieben. In den ersten drei Rennen der Saison 2007 erreichte Heidfeld jeweils den vierten Platz und etablierte sich damit schon zu Anfang als dritte Kraft hinter Ferrari und McLaren. Das Team konnte diese Position durch die Saison halten und belegte am Ende – bedingt durch die Disqualifikation des McLaren-Teams – sogar den zweiten Platz unter den Konstrukteuren. Beim Großen Preis von Kanada konnte Heidfeld das beste Saisonergebnis herausfahren, als er hinter Sieger Lewis Hamilton Zweiter wurde. Dieses Ergebnis stellte zugleich das beste Resultat in der Teamgeschichte dar. Heidfelds gutes Ergebnis wurde allerdings durch einen schweren Unfall seines Teamkollegens Kubica überschattet, der darauf beim nächsten Rennen pausieren musste. Am 21. August 2007 gab BMW-Motorsportdirektor Mario Theissen bekannt, dass Heidfelds Vertrag für die Saison 2008 verlängert wurde. Am Saisonende belegte Heidfeld den fünften Platz in der Fahrerweltmeisterschaft und er musste sich somit nur den Ferrari- und McLaren-Piloten geschlagen geben. Die Saison 2008 begann mit einem zweiten Platz beim Großen Preis von Australien für ihn erfolgreich. Im weiteren Verlauf war er seinem Teamkollegen Kubica jedoch mehrfach, vor allem im Qualifying, unterlegen. Beim Großen Preis von Kanada erzielte Kubica gar den ersten Sieg für BMW Sauber, nachdem Heidfeld für mehrere Runden in Führung lag. Das Rennen beendete er auf Platz zwei. Heidfeld, der auch in Großbritannien und Belgien Zweiter geworden war, gelang es auch in der weiteren Saison nicht, ein Rennen zu gewinnen. Am Saisonende belegte er den sechsten Platz in der Fahrerweltmeisterschaft. Teamintern unterlag er Kubica mit 60 zu 75 Punkten. Obwohl Heidfeld seinem Teamkollegen unterlag ging er auch in der Saison 2009 für BMW Sauber an den Start. Sauber setzte zum Anfang der Saison das Energierückgewinnungssystem KERS ein, konnte jedoch nicht um den WM-Titel mitfahren. Dennoch fuhr Heidfeld bereits beim zweiten Rennen in Malaysia auf den dritten Platz. Nachdem das Rennen wegen starken Regens abgebrochen werden musste und nicht mehr neugestartet werden konnte, wurde für das Rennergebnis die vorherige Runde gewertet, in der Heidfeld den zweiten Platz belegte. Da weniger als 75 % der Renndistanz absolviert wurden, erhielten die Fahrer nur halbe Punkte. Nachdem das Team den Rückstand am Saisonanfang nicht mehr aufholen konnte, gab BMW nach dem Großen Preis von Ungarn bekannt, dass man zum Jahresende aus der Formel 1 aussteigen werde. Nach dieser Entscheidung erzielte Heidfeld noch bei weiteren vier Rennen Punkte. In der Gesamtwertung belegte er mit 19 Punkten den 13. Platz und lag somit genau einen Platz vor Kubica, der 17 Punkte erzielte. Mercedes/Pirelli (2010) Am 4. Februar 2010 gab Mercedes Grand Prix bekannt, dass Heidfeld in der Saison 2010 die Rolle als Test- und Ersatzfahrer des Teams einnehmen werde. Mitte der Saison wurde Heidfeld von Mercedes freigestellt, um als Testfahrer zum Reifenhersteller Pirelli zu wechseln. Zudem war er in dieser Saison, bis zu seinem Abschied von Mercedes, Präsident der Fahrergewerkschaft GPDA. Sauber (2010) Ab dem Großen Preis von Singapur kehrte Heidfeld zu Sauber Motorsport zurück und ersetzte den Spanier Pedro de la Rosa. Damit stand Heidfeld zum insgesamt dritten Mal bei den Schweizern unter Vertrag. Beim Großen Preis von Japan erzielte er mit einem achten Platz seine erste Platzierung in den Punkterängen, die zugleich seine beste war. In der Endphase des Rennens ließ er seinen Teamkollegen, der strategiebedingt über bessere Reifen verfügte, ohne Widerstand auf Platz sieben liegend passieren. Heidfeld bestritt in der Saison fünf Rennen für Sauber, in denen er von den Punkten (sechs zu elf) nicht mit seinem Teamkollegen Kamui Kobayashi mithalten konnte. Allerdings konnte er in weniger Rennen genauso viele Punkte wie sein Vorgänger de la Rosa erzielen. Auch das Qualifying-Duell ging mit eins zu vier gegen den Deutschen, der nur bei seinem letzten Grand Prix einen vergleichbaren Motor hatte, aus. Am Saisonende belegte er den 18. Platz in der Fahrerweltmeisterschaft. Renault (2011) Für die Saison 2011 stand Heidfeld zunächst bei keinem Team unter Vertrag, eine Rückkehr zu Mercedes als Test- und Ersatzfahrer galt aber als recht sicher. Nachdem sich sein ehemaliger Teamkollege Robert Kubica bei einem Rallye-Unfall schwer verletzt hatte, wurde Heidfeld als möglicher Ersatz bis zur vollständigen Genesung Kubicas gehandelt. In der Folge nahm er an Testfahrten für das Renault-Team teil, bei denen er eine Tagesbestzeit erzielte. Mitte Februar wurde er von Renault als Ersatz für den ausgefallenen Kubica unter Vertrag genommen, wo er neben Witali Petrow fuhr. Nachdem er beim Saisonauftakt nach einer unverschuldeten Kollision, die sein Fahrzeug maßgeblich beschädigte, ohne Punkte blieb, beendete er das zweite Rennen in Malaysia auf dem dritten Platz. Dabei gelang es ihm, Red-Bull-Pilot Webber in den letzten Runden hinter sich zu halten. Beim fünften Rennen, dem Großen Preis von Spanien, nahm er wegen eines technischen Defekts nicht am Qualifying teil und musste vom letzten Startplatz starten. Im Rennen zeigte er einige Überholmanöver und verbesserte sich auf den achten Platz. Nachdem sich leitende Mitarbeiter des Rennstalls nicht mit seinen Leistungen zufrieden zeigten, wurde Heidfeld nach dem Großen Preis von Ungarn durch Bruno Senna abgelöst. Teamintern lag Heidfeld zu diesem Zeitpunkt mit 34 zu 32 Punkten knapp vor Petrow. Am Saisonende belegte er den elften Platz in der Weltmeisterschaft. Nach Heidfelds Abgang knüpfte das Team immer weniger an die anfänglichen Erfolge an und die beiden Piloten erzielten nur noch weitere sieben Zähler. WEC und ALMS (seit 2012) Zur Saison 2012 wechselte Heidfeld in die FIA-Langstrecken-Weltmeisterschaft (WEC) zu Rebellion Racing. Er trat dort in einem Lola-Toyota bei drei Rennen in der LMP1-Klasse im Team mit Neel Jani und Nicolas Prost an. Beim 24-Stunden-Rennen von Le Mans belegten er und seine beiden Teamkollegen den vierten Gesamtplatz und entschieden die Wertung der Privatfahrer für sich. 2013 startete Heidfeld weiterhin in der FIA-Langstrecken-Weltmeisterschaft und außerdem in der American Le Mans Series, wo er im Team mit Neel Jani den 2. Rang in der Gesamtwertung belegte. Auch in der Saison 2014 startet Heidfeld weiterhin für Rebellion. Formel E (seit 2014) 2014/15 kehrte Heidfeld in den Formelsport zurück und trat in der neugegründeten FIA-Formel-E-Meisterschaft für Venturi an. Im ersten Rennen, dem Beijing ePrix, kollidierte er in der letzten Rennrunde beim Duell um den Sieg mit Nicolas Prost und verunfallte schwer, blieb aber unverletzt. Auch im zweiten ePrix in Putrajaya kam Heidfeld nach einem Unfall nicht ins Ziel. Beim folgenden Rennen, dem Punta del Este ePrix, erzielte er mit dem zehnten Platz seine erste Punkte-Platzierung. Heidfeld lag bei diesem Rennen zwischenzeitlich in Führung, fiel durch zwei Durchfahrtsstrafen aber nach hinten zurück. Auch beim nächsten Rennen in Buenos Aires ePrix erhielt Heidfeld in Führung liegend eine Durchfahrtsstrafe. Er wurde schließlich Achter. Beim neunten Rennen in Moskau gelang Heidfeld schließlich mit Platz drei die erste Podest-Platzierung. Er schloss die Saison auf dem zwölften Platz im Gesamtklassement ab. 2015/16 wechselte Heidfeld in der Formel E zu Mahindra Racing. Beim Saisonauftakt in Beijing wurde er Dritter. Zum dritten Rennen trat er verletzungsbedingt nicht an und wurde durch Oliver Rowland vertreten. Er beendete die Saison auf dem zehnten Gesamtrang und setzte sich intern mit 53 zu 52 Punkten gegen seinen Teamkollegen Bruno Senna durch. Für die FIA-Formel-E-Meisterschaft 2016/17 bleibt Heidfeld bei Mahindra Racing. 
G;|Hans Kafka, ab 1940 auch John Kafka oder John H. Kafka (* 26. Dezember 1902 in Wien; † 5. Februar 1974 in München) war ein österreichischer Journalist, Schriftsteller und Drehbuchautor. Er ist nicht mit dem Schriftsteller Franz Kafka verwandt. Kafka ging 1925 nach Berlin, wo er als Theater- und Filmkritiker arbeitete und zwei Bände mit Erzählungen veröffentlichte. Nach der Machtübernahme der Nazis 1933 emigrierte er nach Wien, London und Paris und schrieb Drehbücher sowie seinen ersten Roman „Die Geschichte einer großen Liebe“. Von 1940 bis 1958 lebte er in Hollywood und New York, hauptsächlich als Drehbuchautor. Er war lange Jahre Redakteur der Kolumne „Hollywood Calling – Hans Kafka Speaking“ in der deutschen Exilzeitschrift „Aufbau“ und versorgte die deutschsprachige Emigrantenkolonie in Los Angeles mit Neuigkeiten aus dem kulturellen Leben. 1947 und 1949 entstanden seine beiden Hauptwerke, die Romane „The apple orchard“ und „Sicilian street“. 1958 kehrte Kafka zurück nach Deutschland und berichtete als Korrespondent des New Yorker Wochenblatts „Variety“ über das Kulturleben im deutschsprachigen Raum.  Frühe Jahre Hans Kafka wurde am 26. Dezember 1902 in Wien-Mariahilf als Sohn eines jüdischen Arztes geboren. Er hatte eine Schwester, Mimi Kafka, die in erster Ehe mit Fritz Mandel verheiratet war, in zweiter Ehe mit Hans Schnabl. Sie emigrierte 1939 nach Australien und kehrte 1950 nach Wien zurück, wo sie 1975 starb. Der „kleine Kafka“, wie ihn seine Freunde im kalifornischen Exil nannten, war nicht verwandt mit Franz Kafka, eine Begegnung mit diesem gehörte jedoch zu seinen „stärksten Kindheitserinnerungen“. Er besuchte das Wiener Kandl-Gymnasium und begann anschließend auf väterlichen Wunsch ein Medizinstudium an der Wiener Universität. Nach zwei Jahren tauschte er das Studienfach gegen Philosophie und Rechtswissenschaften. Während oder nach dem Studium war er bei der Wiener Creditanstalt angestellt. Als junger Mann veröffentlichte er erste Gedichte und Prosaskizzen in den Wiener Zeitschriften „Die Wage“ und „Der Tag“ (gegründet 1922). Das „Berliner Tageblatt“ brachte Reisereportagen Kafkas aus Italien, aber auch Kurzgeschichten, Skizzen und Aufsätze. Berlin (ab 1925) 1925 ging Kafka nach Berlin und lebte von nun ab vom Schreiben. Er arbeitete hauptsächlich als Theater- und Filmkritiker für die Tageszeitungen „B.Z. am Mittag“ und „Tempo“, die beide im Ullstein-Verlag erschienen, und für das Wochenblatt „Die literarische Welt“. Für die illustrierten Wochenblätter „Simplicissimus“ und „Jugend“ lieferte er kleine Glossen und kurze Erzählungen. Ab 1930 verfasste Kafka im Auftrag des Ullstein-Verlags unter anderem Reportagen über berühmte Kriminalfälle, für die er auf Reisen durch Italien, Frankreich und Skandinavien recherchierte. 1927 erschien seine erste Novellensammlung „Das Grenzenlose“ mit „fünfundzwanzig Geschichten“, die Franz Theodor Csokor als „surrealistisch“ empfand, während Oskar Maria Graf das „Spielerisch-Gelassene“ der Erzählungen hervorhob. Es folgte 1928 sein zweiter Erzählband „Berechnungen“ und 1931 die Biographie „Hans Albers. Das Märchen einer Karriere“. 1932 betätigte sich Kafka zum ersten Mal als Drehbuchautor für das Filmlustspiel „Im Bann des Eulenspiegels“. Von 1928 bis 1932 war Kafka auch an 18 Hörfunksendungen beteiligt. Exil (ab 1933) Nach der Machtübernahme der Nazis verlor Kafka im April 1933 wegen seiner „nicht-arischen“ Abstammung seine Anstellung beim Ullstein-Verlag. Er unternahm eine Reise nach Chikago, lebte kurze Zeit in der Tschechoslowakei, kehrte 1934 in seine Heimatstadt Wien zurück, ging 1936 nach London, 1937 nach Paris und emigrierte 1940 in die USA, wo er bis 1958 in Hollywood lebte, zwischendurch auch drei Jahre in New York. Wien / London Um seinen Lebensunterhalt zu sichern, arbeitete Kafka in Wien für den Ralph A. Höger Verlag an verschiedenen Auftragswerken, unter anderem verfasste er einen Kunst-Baedeker von Wien und 1935 das mit italienischem Geld finanzierte Buch „Gedanken und Worte“, eine Auswahl von Reden und Schriften Mussolinis, die er übersetzte und um eine Einleitung und Kapitelkommentare ergänzte. Zwischen 1935 und 1936 entstand, ebenfalls in Wien, Kafkas erster Roman „Die Geschichte einer großen Liebe“, die „fiktionale Schilderung der Liebesbeziehung zwischen Lord Nelson und Lady Hamilton“, die er unter dem Pseudonym Walter Gundacker veröffentlichte. 1936 übersiedelte er nach London, „um mit Alexander Korda an Filmprojekten zu arbeiten“. Paris 1937 ließ sich Kafka mit seiner Frau, der Theaterschauspielerin Trude Burr, in Paris nieder. Hier verfasste er das Drehbuch zu dem Film „Carrefour“, der 1938 von Kurt Bernhardt verfilmt und vom französischen Staat preisgekrönt wurde. Eine englische Version des Films kam 1940 unter dem Titel „Dead Man’s Shoes“ heraus. In Paris schrieb er auch die Story „The Uniform“, die 1940 unter dem Titel „They Met in Bombay“ in Hollywood verfilmt wurde. Die Story „The Birthday Gift“, konnte er ebenfalls nach Hollywood verkaufen (erst 1960 unter dem Titel „North to Alaska“ verfilmt), und von dem Erlös die Emigration nach den USA finanzieren. Im Juni 1939 zogen Kafka und seine Frau zusammen mit dem Komponisten Erich Zeisl und seiner Familie in eine Villa bei Paris (siehe Hans Kafka und Erich Zeisl). Nach Kriegsausbruch wurde Kafka als Österreicher fünf Monate lang interniert, in Maisons-Laffitte bei Paris und in zwei Lagern in der Normandie, Domfront und Damigny. Nachdem seine Frau beim amerikanischen Konsulat in Paris Visa für die Ausreise nach den USA erwirkt hatte, wurde Kafka im Februar 1940 aus dem Internierungslager entlassen. Hollywood (ab 1940) Nach seiner Freilassung aus der französischen Internierung schifften sich Kafka und seine Frau auf dem Dampfer „De Grasse“ ein, dem letzten Fahrgastschiff, das vor dem deutschen Einmarsch noch von Frankreich aus abfuhr. Am 22. Februar 1940 landeten sie in New York und wurden von dem Produzenten Paul Gordon und Kafkas Agent George Marton empfangen. Im Mai 1940 ließ sich das Ehepaar Kafka in Los Angeles nieder. Sie mieteten einen Bungalow in der Larrabee Street im Westen Hollywoods, einige Kilometer östlich von Beverly Hills, wo viele prominente Emigranten residierten. In der „Kolonie“ der deutsch-österreichischen Emigranten, wo jeder jeden kannte, fühlte er sich alsbald zu Hause. In einem Akt der Anpassung an die neue Heimat änderte Kafka seinen Namen in John Kafka bzw. John H. Kafka und nahm 1945 auch unter diesem Namen die amerikanische Staatsbürgerschaft an. Anders als viele seiner Emigrantenkollegen fand der gut englisch sprechende Kafka dank seiner bereits in England geknüpften Kontakte schnell Arbeit in Hollywood. Seine Frau hatte weniger Glück. Sie arbeitete zwar als Schauspielerin an kleineren Bühnen in Los Angeles, eine Karriere beim Film blieb ihr jedoch verschlossen. Im Sommer 1940 arbeitete Kafka an dem Film „They Met in Bombay“, für den er mit „The Uniform“ die Vorlage geliefert hatte, dann an dem Film „Crossroads“, eine amerikanische Neuauflage von „Carrefour“ bzw. „Dead Man’s Shoes“. Bei beiden Filmen wird Kafka im Vorspann nur als Story-Geber genannt. Auch Kafka musste immer wieder um Verträge mit den Studios ringen, wie aus seinem Briefwechsel mit Erich Zeisl hervorgeht. Im Lauf der Jahre hatte er mehrere Kontrakte mit einer Laufzeit von vier bis zwölf Monaten, drei Verträge bei MGM, je zwei bei Columbia und King Brothers und einen mit Warner Brothers. Seine Mitarbeit an dem Drehbuch zu dem 1960 herauskommenden Film „Man on a String“ war Kafkas letzte Arbeit für Hollywood. Von 1941 bis 1947 war Kafka Mitarbeiter der wöchentlich erscheinenden deutschsprachigen Emigrantenzeitschrift „Aufbau“ (siehe unten). Zeitweise war Kafka auch Redakteur der Beilage „Die Westküste“ und der Clubseite des „Jewish Club of 1933“, in dem er Mitglied war. 1944 und 1946 wurde er jeweils für zwei Jahre als Member of the Board of Directors (Vorstandsmitglied) gewählt und dem Press Committee zugeteilt, das verantwortlich war für die Clubseite im „Aufbau“. Zwischen 1945 und 1946 entstand sein erstes Hauptwerk, ein Roman in englischer Sprache, „The apple orchard“, der 1947 veröffentlicht wurde. Der Roman schildert die „Lebensgeschichte“ einer Apfelbaumplantage im amerikanischen Nordwesten, beginnend zur Zeit des Bürgerkriegs, und beschreibt gleichnishaft die Geschichte des amerikanischen Westens. Die Apfelplantage wird von Pilgern aufgebaut, erlebt während eines Goldrauschs ihren Niedergang und dann ihre erfolgreiche Wiederauferstehung durch die gesammelten Anstrengungen einer Kooperative. Die Meinung der Kritik war geteilt, aber eher positiv. Warner Brothers kaufte zwar die Filmrechte, aber nachdem Kafka ein halbes Jahr am Drehbuch gearbeitet hatte, wurde die Verfilmung des Stoffs wieder aufgegeben, wahrscheinlich aus politischen Bedenken. New York 1947 beendete Kafka seine Mitarbeit beim „Aufbau“ und übersiedelte 1948 mit seiner Frau nach New York, Schauplatz seines zweiten Hauptwerks, des ebenfalls englisch geschriebenen Romans „Sicilian street“, den er 1948 in Hollywood begonnen hatte. 1949 vollendete er den Roman, der „den Existenzkampf eines italienischen Puppentheaters in New York schildert“. Kafka beleuchtet darin „den Zusammenprall der alten europäischen Romantik mit der amerikanischen Wirklichkeit“. Der Roman stand vier Wochen auf der vorläufigen Bestsellerliste der New York Times, im übrigen war die Meinung der Kritik auch bei diesem Werk geteilt. Drei Hollywood-Studios erwarben die Optionsrechte für den Stoff, ohne sie zu nutzen. Nach seiner Rückkehr nach Deutschland erstellte Kafka eine deutsche Neufassung des Romans mit dem Titel „Verzauberung in Manhattan“, die 1960 in Hamburg erschien und 1961 vom Bertelsmann Lesering übernommen wurde. Hollywood (ab 1950) 1950 ließ sich Kafka wieder in Hollywood nieder. Er verfasste ein Drehbuch für seinen Roman „Sicilian street“, das jedoch nicht verfilmt wurde. Um 1952 geriet seine Karriere als Filmschriftsteller ins Stocken. Gründe dafür waren eine schwere Erkrankung in den Jahren 1953 bis 1955, gewiss aber auch sein vorübergehender Weggang nach New York, die reduzierte Produktion der Filmgesellschaften und die Konkurrenz durch renommierte Drehbuchautoren unter den Kriegsheimkehrern. Kafka versuchte, sich durch den Verkauf von Geschichten an kleinere Filmgesellschaften und die aufkommenden Fernsehproduktionen über Wasser zu halten, und lieferte zudem Beiträge für den deutschsprachigen Sender Voice of America und sogar Werbetexte für eine Versicherung. Aus dieser Lebenssituation entsprang eine gewisse Verbitterung, die ihn 1957, zwei Jahre nach dem Tod von Thomas Mann veranlasste, gegen einen deutschen Filmproduzenten einen kuriosen Prozess zu führen. Er behauptete, die Grundidee zu Thomas Manns Roman „Die Bekenntnisse des Hochstaplers Felix Krull“ stamme aus einer seiner Novellen und er müsse deswegen im Filmvorspann als Mitautor genannt werden. Kafka verlor den Prozess, auch darum, weil Thomas Mann den Romanstoff nachweislich 20 Jahre vor der Veröffentlichung von Kafkas Novelle konzipiert hatte. 1956 schrieb Kafka das Theaterstück „Mystery Story“, für das fünf Broadway-Produzenten das Optionsrecht erwarben, ohne dass das Stück jedoch zur Aufführung gelangte. 1960 wurde die gleichzeitig entstandene deutsche Fassung des Stücks unter dem Titel „Der Mann im Turm“ in Wien mit Erfolg uraufgeführt. München (ab 1958) Im Jahr 1958 trat Hans Kafka als Deutschland-Korrespondent in die Dienste der New Yorker Wochenschrift „Variety“, einem Branchenblatt der Film- und Unterhaltungsindustrie. Er übersiedelte mit seiner Frau am 11. Oktober 1958 nach München, Altheimer Eck, und berichtete fortan über das Film-, Fernseh-, Theater-, Opern- und Musikgeschehen in Deutschland und von den Festspielen in Bayreuth, Salzburg und Wien. Obwohl er nie mehr in die USA reiste, hielt er aufgrund seiner Tätigkeit engen Kontakt mit Hollywood und New York. Kafka war aus „pragmatischen Erwerbsgründen“ nach Deutschland zurückgekehrt, nicht als „überzeugter Remigrant“. Er blieb im Herzen Amerikaner und konnte das Verhalten der Deutschen nach 1933 nicht vergessen. 1972 gestand er in einem Brief an John M. Spalek: „If I weren’t employed by an American company, I wouldn’t be here.“ 1959 und 1960 wurden noch einmal drei Filme realisiert, an deren Drehbüchern Kafka beteiligt war: 1959 wurde das letzte Drehbuch, an dem er in Hollywood mitgearbeitet hatte, unter dem Titel „Man on a string“ (deutsch: „Geheimakte M“) verfilmt. Auch seine Story „The Birthday Gift“ kam nach zwanzig Jahren Wartezeit 1960 unter dem Titel „North to Alaska“ in die Kinos. Das 1959 in englischer Sprache geschriebene Drehbuch „Festival“ wurde 1960 als deutscher Spielfilm unter dem Titel „Schlussakkord“ produziert. Ebenfalls 1960 wurde die deutsche Fassung seines Theaterstücks „Mystery Story“ unter dem Titel „Der Mann im Turm“ in Wien erfolgreich uraufgeführt, weitere Inszenierungen blieben jedoch aus. Im gleichen Jahr erstellte Kafka eine deutsche Neufassung seines Romans „Sicilian street“ unter dem Titel „Verzauberung in Manhattan“, die in Hamburg erschien und 1961 vom Bertelsmann Lesering übernommen wurde. Lebensabend Kafka gelang es nicht mehr, in der literarischen Szene der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Fuß zu fassen. Mehrere Herzinfarkte nahmen ihn körperlich und seelisch stark mit, zudem war er zuletzt gelähmt und fast blind und auf Pflege angewiesen. Am 5. Februar 1974 setzte Kafka im Alter von 71 Jahren seinem Leben ein Ende. Er starb in München und wurde in seiner Heimatstadt Wien beigesetzt. Trude Kafka-Burr überlebte ihren Mann um 17 Jahre und starb 1991. Kafkas Nachlass ging in den Besitz von Verwandten in den USA über. Nach Roland Jaeger liefen 2002 „Bemühungen, die dort noch vorhandenen Papiere und Manuskripte für die Exilforschung zu sichern“. Hans Kafka und Erich Zeisl In den Pariser Emigrantenkreisen lernte Kafka den österreichischen Komponisten Erich Zeisl kennen, mit dem er bis zu dessen Tod 1959 eng befreundet war. Kafka kannte Zeisls Frau Gertrud aus Kindertagen, sie war eine Schulfreundin seiner Schwester Mimi, die ebenfalls nach Paris emigriert war. Zeisl war mit seiner Familie nach der Reichskristallnacht von Wien nach Paris geflüchtet und hatte die ersten Monate in einem Hotel verbracht. Im Juni 1939 zogen die Familien Zeisl und Kafka zusammen in die Villa Les Griffons in Le Vésinet, 20 km westlich von Paris. Später im Exil in den USA setzte Kafka alle Hebel in Bewegung, um für Zeisl bei MGM einen Vertrag als Filmmusiker zu erwirken. Im Mai 1939 starb im Pariser Exil Joseph Roth, ein Wiener Landsmann der Kafkas und der Zeisls. Zu seinem Gedenken veranstalteten im Juli 1939 Mitglieder des Wiener Reinhardt-Ensembles unter Leitung von Paul Gordon eine szenische Aufführung von Joseph Roths „Hiob. Roman eines einfachen Mannes“, mit Musik von Erich Zeisl und unter Mitwirkung von Trude Burr als Mendels Tochter Mirjam. Zeisl, tief beeindruckt von Roths Roman, vor allem wegen der starken Bezüge zu seinem eigenen Emigrantenschicksal und weil er sich mit dem Protagonisten des Romans identifizierte, gewann Kafka für die Idee, „Hiob“ in eine Oper umzusetzen. Kafka stellte das englischsprachige Libretto fertig, aber Zeisl blieb in den zwei Jahrzehnten, die er bis zu seinem Lebensende an dem Werk arbeitete, auf halbem Weg stecken: als er 1959 starb, waren nur die ersten zwei von vier Akten fertig. 1952 wurde in Los Angeles Zeisls komische Oper „Leonce und Lena“ aufgeführt. Kafka hatte dazu das deutsche Libretto, das Hugo F. Königsgarten nach Georg Büchners Bühnenstück erstellt hatte, ins Englische übertragen. |
G;Jennifer Lynn Connelly (* 12. Dezember 1970 in Catskill Mountains, New York) ist eine US-amerikanische Schauspielerin und unter anderem Golden Globe- und Oscar-Preisträgerin. Sie war zunächst Kindermodel und begann ihre Kinokarriere 1984 mit dem Gangster-Epos Es war einmal in Amerika. Es folgten Filme wie Die Reise ins Labyrinth (1986) und Rocketeer – Der Raketenmann (1991), bis sie sich in den späten 1990er Jahren als ernsthafte Schauspielerin etablierte. Sie hatte ihren Durchbruch als Marion Silver in Darren Aronofskys Requiem for a Dream (2000) und gewann für die Rolle der Alicia Nash in Ron Howards A Beautiful Mind – Genie und Wahnsinn (2001) die Filmpreise Golden Globe und den Oscar als beste Nebendarstellerin. Neben ihrer Kinokarriere war sie Aushängeschild für Kampagnen der Kosmetikunternehmen Revlon und Shiseido sowie des Pariser Modehauses Balenciaga.  Kindheit und Arbeit als Kindermodel Jennifer Connelly wurde am 12. Dezember 1970 als Tochter des Bekleidungsherstellers Gerard Connelly und der Antiquitätenhändlerin Ilene in den Catskill Mountains geboren. Ihre Familie väterlicherseits ist irischer und norwegischer Herkunft. Die Ahnen ihrer Mutter waren russisch-polnische Juden. Sie wuchs auf im Brooklyner Stadtteil Brooklyn Heights, wo sie die kunstorientierte Privatschule Saint Ann’s besuchte. 1976 zog die Familie nach Woodstock. Vier Jahre später kehrten die Connellys nach Brooklyn zurück und Jennifer ging an ihre alte Schule zurück. Ein Werbefachmann, der mit ihrem Vater befreundet war, schlug ihren Eltern vor, dass sie als Kindermodel arbeiten könne. Kurz danach trat sie der Modelagentur Ford Models bei. Sie sammelte ihre ersten beruflichen Erfahrungen bereits im Alter von zehn Jahren mit einigen Bildern in Modezeitschriften und dann Auftritten in Werbespots. In einem Interview der Tageszeitung The Guardian erklärte sie, dass sie nach einiger Zeit als Kindermodel keine Ambitionen hatte, Schauspielerin zu werden. Frühe Karriere Ihren ersten Filmauftritt hatte Connelly 1984 in dem Film Es war einmal in Amerika. Der italienische Regisseur Sergio Leone gab ihr die Rolle der jungen, aufstrebenden Balletttänzerin und Schauspielerin Deborah Gelly, weil sie beim Vorsprechen die Ballettbewegungen für die Rolle imitierte. Sie beschrieb den Film als „einen unglaublich idyllischen Einstieg in die Schauspielerei“. Während der Dreharbeiten zu Es war einmal in Amerika sah man sie in der Folge Stranger in Town der britischen Serie Die unglaublichen Geschichten von Roald Dahl. Bereits in ihrem zweiten Film Phenomena von 1985 erhielt sie die Hauptrolle der Jennifer Corvino, ein junges Mädchen, das durch seine übersinnlichen Fähigkeiten versucht, einen Serienmörder zu jagen, der Schülerinnen des Mädcheninternates „Richard Wagner“ tötete. Der wenig beachtete Ticket zum Himmel (TV-Titel Sieben Minuten im Himmel) wurde noch 1985 uraufgeführt. Es folgte Jim Hensons Fantasyfilm Die Reise ins Labyrinth (1986), in dem sie als Teenager Sarah ihren kleinen Bruder Toby aus den Fängen des Koboldkönigs Jareth (gespielt von David Bowie) befreien muss. Obwohl der Film an den Kassen nicht erfolgreich war, bekam er eine große Fangemeinde. Im Dezember desselben Jahres spielte sie in phonetischem Japanisch die Pop-Lieder Monologue of Love und Message of Love für den japanischen Markt ein. 1988 war sie als junge Ballett-Studentin im italienischen Film Étoile und als College-Studentin in Some Girls zu sehen. Sie erschien mehrfach auf der Titelseite des US-amerikanischen Teenager-Magazins Seventeen. Über ihre frühe Karriere sagte sie: „Bevor es mir bewusst wurde, wurde die Schauspielerei mein Lebensinhalt. Es war ein sonderbarer Weg zum Erwachsenwerden, gepaart mit meiner Persönlichkeit.“ Sie beschrieb sich, als würde sie sich während der Zeit ihrer Adoleszenz in etwa wie eine „laufende Puppe“ fühlen, ohne sich jemals über ihre Karriere Gedanken machen zu müssen. Inzwischen machte sie ihren High-School-Abschluss und besuchte ein College. Von 1988 bis 1989 studierte sie Englisch an der Yale University. 1990 wechselte sie an die Stanford University, um dort Theaterwissenschaften zu studieren. Auf Vorschlag ihrer Eltern entschloss sie sich, ihr Studium aufzugeben, um ihre Kinokarriere zu verfolgen. 1990 spielte sie die erpresste Gloria Harper in Dennis Hoppers The Hot Spot – Spiel mit dem Feuer, der viel weniger Geld einspielte, als er gekostet hatte. Dort hatte sie ihre erste Nacktszene, von der sie sagte „Nacktheit war für mich hart und etwas, worüber ich nachgedacht habe, aber nicht in einem schäbigen Kontext“. Sie wurde anfangs von Garry Marshall für die Hauptrolle in seiner Liebeskomödie Pretty Woman vorgesehen. Er befand jedoch, dass sie zu jung dafür wäre, und gab Julia Roberts die Rolle. 1991 spielte sie in der Komödie Kevins Cousin allein im Supermarkt, die schlechte Kritiken bekam. Es folgte im selben Jahr Disneys Science-Fiction-Abenteuer Rocketeer – Der Raketenmann, in dem sie die Hauptrolle der aufstrebenden Schauspielerin Jenny übernahm, die von dem Spion Neville Sinclair gefangen genommen ist, während ihr Freund Cliff „Rocketeer“ (gespielt von Billy Campbell) versucht, sie zu retten. Die kostspielige Produktion wurde schließlich zum Flop. 1992 spielte sie an der Seite von Jason Priestley in dem Videoclip von Roy Orbison I Drove All Night. Nach dem Misserfolg ihrer letzten Filme spielte Connelly in einer Reihe von kleineren Filmen wie das Drama Higher Learning – Die Rebellen im Jahr 1995, der Thriller Nach eigenen Regeln von 1996 und das Drama Far Harbor im selben Jahr. Sie etablierte sich in Filmen der späten 1990er Jahre als ernsthafte Schauspielerin. Im Drama Die Abbotts, deren Handlung in den 1950er Jahren spielt, ist sie als die älteste der drei Töchter des Millionärs Lloyd Abbott in der Kleinstadt Haley zu sehen. 1998 übernahm sie eine Nebenrolle in Alex Proyas Science-Fiction-Drama Dark City, in dem Rufus Sewell, William Hurt und Kiefer Sutherland mitspielten. 2000 erschien sie als die junge Geliebte des Malers Jackson Pollock, dessen Stilrichtung der Abstrakte Expressionismus ist, gespielt von Ed Harris, in der Biografie Pollock und als Catherine Miller in der Miniserie The $treet – Wer bietet mehr. Durchbruch Connelly setzte ihre Karriere in den frühen 2000er Jahren erfolgreich mit Rollen in Waking the Dead, der Hubert-Selby-Verfilmung Requiem for a Dream, A Beautiful Mind – Genie und Wahnsinn und der Bestseller-Verfilmung Haus aus Sand und Nebel fort. Obwohl Keith Gordon sie anfangs nicht für eine ernsthafte Schauspielerin hielt, besetzte er sie in seinem Drama Waking the Dead, nachdem er auf Empfehlung ihrer Managerin ihre Arbeit in Far Harbor von 1996 gesehen hatte. Sie trat als die Sozialaktivistin Sarah Williams auf, die in einem Auto mit zwei chilenischen Exilpolitikern in Minneapolis stirbt, als auf die Gruppe ein Attentat verübt wird. Von der Rolle sagte Connelly „Waking the Dead war der erste Film, in dem ich meinte, dass ich spielen konnte, wie es mir beliebte. Ich war wirklich bestrebt, dass ich das Beste aus der Rolle heraushole und habe mich dafür sehr engagiert. Die Rolle bedeutete mir viel.“ Noch im Jahr 2000 feierte sie ihren Durchbruch mit Darren Aronofskys Requiem for a Dream. Sie interessierte sich für das Drehbuch wegen seiner Darstellung der Drogensucht und ihrer Auswirkung auf das Leben der Hauptfiguren. In diesem Film spielt sie die junge Frau Marion Silver, die zusammen mit ihrem Freund Harry Goldfarb (gespielt von Jared Leto) einen Modeladen aufmachen will, sich aber letztendlich prostituiert, um ihre Drogensucht zu finanzieren. Connelly bereitete sich für ihre Rolle vor, indem sie sich ein Apartment in ihrem Haus anmietete und darin wohnte. Während dieser Zeit isolierte sie sich sozial. Sie malte, hörte Musik, entwarf Kleidermode und sann über ihre Süchte und deren Ursache – wie die Protagonistin es ihrer Ansicht nach tun würde. Ferner sprach sie mit Suchtkranken und besuchte ein Treffen der Selbsthilfegruppe Narcotics Anonymous gemeinsam mit einem ihrer Freunde, der Teil der Gruppe war. Sie wurde zum Vorsprechen für die Rolle der Alicia Nash in Ron Howards 2001 erschienenem A Beautiful Mind eingeladen, nachdem ihre Managerin an den Filmproduzenten einen Clip von dem damals noch unveröffentlichten Requiem for a Dream geschickt hatte. Ihr gutes Verhältnis zum Hauptdarsteller Russell Crowe beeindruckte den Regisseur und die Produzenten. Sie verkörpert die Frau des schizophrenen Mathematik-Genies John Nash, dessen Geschichte der Film erzählt. Auf ihren Wunsch lernte sie die echte Alicia Nash kennen, um mehr über ihr Leben zu erfahren, bevor die Dreharbeiten begannen. Der Film wurde zum Kassenschlager, der 313 Millionen US-Dollar weltweit einspielte. Für ihre Leistung erhielt Connelly 2002 den Golden Globe, den Oscar und den BAFTA Award als beste Nebendarstellerin. Sie sagte von dem Film „A Beautiful Mind ist ein Film, auf den ich stolz bin und den ich sehr liebe“. 2003 zeigte sie Interesse an der philosophischen Perspektive des Regisseurs Ang Lee für die Comicverfilmung Hulk. Sie trat in der Rolle der Wissenschaftlerin Betty Ross auf, die die Ex-Freundin des Kernphysikers Bruce Banner ist. Der Film spielte weltweit knapp 245 Millionen US-Dollar ein. Connelly sagte, dass sie sehr daran interessiert war, Kathy Nicolo aus dem Haus aus Sand und Nebel nach dem gleichnamigen Roman von Andre Dubus III zu porträtieren, nachdem sie das Drehbuch gelesen hatte. „Ich mochte die Tatsache, dass es keinen ‚good guy‘ und keinen ‚bad guy‘ gibt. Ich fand es wirklich zwingend, dass beide Seiten Dinge tun, die moralisch zu hinterfragen sind, weil das Leben oft so ist.“ Connelly spielt eine verlassene Frau, die wegen eines bürokratischen Fehlers aus ihrem Bungalow an der nebligen nordkalifornischen Pazifikküste vertrieben wurde, und dann gegen den neuen Besitzer, den iranischen Einwanderer Massoud Amir Behrani (gespielt von Ben Kingsley), um das Haus kämpft. Folgende Karriere 2005 drehte sie unter der Regie des Brasilianers Walter Salles den Horror-Film Dark Water – Dunkle Wasser, der eine Neuverfilmung von Hideo Nakatas Dark Water aus 2002 ist. Sie spielt die attraktive, psychisch labile junge Mutter Dahlia, die mit ihrer kleinen Tochter Cecilia während der Scheidung in eine heruntergekommene Wohnung in einer Massensiedlung in Roosevelt Island in New York zieht, in der paranormale Ereignisse stattfinden. 2006 war sie in dem Drama Little Children in der Nebenrolle der Autorin und betrogenen Ehefrau Kathy Adamson neben Patrick Wilson und Kate Winslet zu sehen. Im selben Jahr übernahm sie die Hauptrolle neben Leonardo DiCaprio in dem Abenteuerfilm Blood Diamond, der den Handel mit Blutdiamanten thematisiert. Sie spielte die US-amerikanische Journalistin Maddie Bowen, die über den Handel mit Blutdiamanten vor dem Hintergrund des Bürgerkriegs in Sierra Leone recherchiert. 2007 erschien sie, neben Joaquin Phoenix und Mark Ruffalo, in dem Drama Ein einziger Augenblick. Der Film handelt von einer Familie, die ihren zehnjährigen Sohn bei einem Verkehrsunfall verliert, als er unachtsam eine Straße betritt. Sie beschrieb damals die Rolle der Grace als härter als ihre bisherigen Rollen. Sie wurde zum Aushängeschild für die Kampagnen 2008 des Kosmetikunternehmens Revlon und des Pariser Modehauses Balenciaga. Sie war zunächst die erste Wahl des Regisseurs Scott Derrickson für die Besetzung der Rolle der Helen Benson in der Neuverfilmung von dem Science-Fiction-Film Der Tag, an dem die Erde stillstand aus dem Jahr 1951. Obwohl sie die Leistung von Patricia Neal in dem originalen Film lobte, in dem Helen Benson eine Sekretärin war, akzeptierte sie die neue Version, in der Helen Benson eine Astrobiologin war. Sie hatte im selben Jahr einen Cameo-Auftritt in dem Fantasyfilm Tintenherz nach dem gleichnamigen Roman der deutschen Autorin Cornelia Funke. Ihr nächstes Projekt war die prominent besetzte Komödie Er steht einfach nicht auf Dich neben Jennifer Aniston, Ginnifer Goodwin, Scarlett Johansson und Drew Barrymore. Sie war zunächst in Creation, ein Film über das Leben des britischen Naturforschers Charles Darwin während des Schreibens seines Buches Die Entstehung der Arten und der Trauer seiner Familie wegen des Verlustes ihrer Lieblingstochter Annie neben ihrem Mann aus dem wirklichen Leben Paul Bettany zu sehen. Sie lieh der Figur #7 des Tim Burtons Animationsfilms #9 ihre Stimme. Anfang 2011 übernahm sie die Nebenrolle der Köchin Beth an der Seite von Vince Vaughn und Kevin James in der Tragikomödie Dickste Freunde, die zum kommerziellen Flop wurde, und überwiegend schlechte Kritiken bekam. Die Komödie Wer’s glaubt, wird selig – Salvation Boulevard, in der sie an der Seite von Greg Kinnear und Pierce Brosnan zu sehen ist, wurde auf dem Sundance Film Festival 2011 uraufgeführt. Die Geschichte handelt von einem Katz-und-Maus-Spiel, in dem der charismatische Megakirche-Pastor Dan, der eine ganze Kleinstadt führt, versucht, den einzigen Zeugen eines Mordes in der Gemeinde loszuwerden. Obwohl Dustin Lance Blacks Kleinstadt-Komödie Virginia 2010 unter dem Namen What’s Wrong with Virginia auf dem Toronto Film Festival 2010 uraufgeführt wurde, kam der Film erst im Mai 2012 nach einer Überarbeitung und Umbenennung in die Kinos. Connelly porträtiert die geistig gestörte alleinstehende Mutter Virginia, die eine über zwei Jahrzehnte dauernden Affäre mit dem verheirateten Sheriff Dick Tipton hat. Sie droht ihren Verstand zu verlieren und ignoriert Zeichen eines Lungenkrebses, als sich ihr Sohn Emmet in die Tochter Tiptons verliebt. Um die Nöte und Hindernisse Virginias zu begreifen, verbrachte Connelly Zeit im New York State Psychiatric Institute sowie im Krebszentrum der New York University. Auf Wunsch des Regisseurs nahm sie an der Kleidungsauswahl für die Rolle sowie an der Wahl der Innenausstattung des Hauses von Virginia teil. Über den Film sagte sie „Virginia ist ein sehr eigenartiger Independent-Film: Er ist sehr persönlich“. Im Frühjahr 2012 wurde bekannt, dass Connelly in dem Familiendrama Love Stories die Ex-Frau des Schriftstellers Bill Borgens (gespielt von Gregg Kinnear) spielen wird, von der er nach der Scheidung vor drei Jahren besessen ist. Im Februar desselben Jahres wurde sie als Markenbotschafterin für die Kampagne 2012 des japanischen Kosmetikunternehmens Shiseido vorgestellt, für das sie schon in den 1980er Jahren gearbeitet hatte. Im März erschien das Audible-Hörbuch The Sheltering Sky von Paul Bowles, in dem sie vorliest. Ebenfalls 2012 begannen die Dreharbeiten zu Darren Aronofskys Noah, in dem sie die Rolle von Noahs Frau Naameh spielt. Es ist ihre erste Zusammenarbeit mit Darren Aronofsky seit Requiem for a Dream aus dem Jahr 2000 und mit Russell Crowe seit A Beautiful Mind aus dem Jahr 2001. Der Film erschien 2014. Im Oktober desselben Jahres wurde bekannt, dass sie sich in Verhandlungen für eine Rolle in der Verfilmung vom Fantasyroman im Stil des magischen Realismus Wintermärchen befand, in der Russell Crowe und Will Smith mitspielen. Sie bekam noch 2012 eine Rolle in dem Drama Cry/Fly. 2013 schloss sie sich mit der Liebesgeschichte Shelter, dem Regiedebüt von ihrem Ehemann Paul Bettany an. 
G;|Wladimir Natanowitsch Gelfand (russisch Влади́мир Ната́нович Ге́льфанд; wiss. Transliteration Vladimir Natanovič Gel’fand; * 1. März 1923 in Nowoarchangelsk, Ukrainische SSR; † 25. November 1983 in Dnepropetrowsk) war ein Offizier der Roten Armee im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Er arbeitete nach dem Krieg bis zu seinem Tod als Berufsschullehrer. Die Erlebnisse während seiner Militärzeit zeichnete Gelfand in einem Tagebuch auf, das in unbearbeiteter Form unter dem Titel Deutschland-Tagebuch 1945–1946: Aufzeichnungen eines Rotarmisten im Jahr 2005 in Deutschland erschien. Es ist das erste und einzige private Tagebuch eines Offiziers der Roten Armee, das in deutscher Sprache vorliegt.  Wladimir Gelfand wurde in einer jüdischen Familie geboren, seine Mutter hieß Nadeschda Wladimirowna Gorodynskaja (1902–1982), sein Vater Natan Solomonowitsch Gelfand (1894–1974). Die jüdische Familie lebte sehr bescheiden. Wladimir Gelfands Mutter kam aus ärmlichen Verhältnissen, sie war eines von acht Kindern. Als junge Frau verdiente sie mit Privatunterricht etwas Geld. Wladimir Gelfands Vater hatte zunächst in einer Zementfabrik in Dniprodserschynsk gearbeitet und nach der Oktoberrevolution berufsbildende Kurse besucht. Während der Vater parteilos blieb, gehörte die Mutter seit 1917, also schon in sehr jungen Jahren, zu den Bolschewiki. Parteifunktionen übte sie offenbar nicht aus, doch Wladimir hielt es in einem Lebenslauf für erwähnenswert, dass sie am Bürgerkrieg teilgenommen hatte. Sie wurde in den 1920ern aus der Partei ausgeschlossen. Dies zerstörte Ihre Karriere, bewahrte sie jedoch vor zukünftigen Repressionen. Wladimir Gelfands Eltern lebten also in einem ganz typischen Milieu des in den dreißiger Jahren zunehmend industrialisierten Südens der Sowjetunion: in dem der proletarisierten jüdischen Minderheit, die Anschluss an die kommunistische Bewegung gefunden hatte. Auf der Suche nach einträglicher Arbeit und familiärer Unterstützung gelangte die junge Familie in die Region um Kislowodsk im Kaukasus. 1926 wohnte sie in Jessentuki, wo die Eltern des Vaters lebten, kehrte aber schon 1928 wieder ins ukrainische Industriegebiet zurück. Hier arbeitete der Vater in einem Metallbetrieb als Brigadier und wurde – den Angaben des Sohnes zufolge – als „Stoßarbeiter“ ausgezeichnet. Die Mutter war als Erzieherin in einem Betriebskindergarten beschäftigt, in dem auch Wladimir betreut wurde. Nach seiner Einschulung im Jahr 1932 übernahm sie eine Stelle in der Personalverwaltung eines großen Industriebetriebes. 1933 zog die Familie in die nahegelegene Industriemetropole Dnipropetrowsk. Die Eltern trennten sich, als Wladimir noch zur Schule ging. An Kleidung und Nahrung konnten die Eltern nichts Besonderes bieten, doch sie förderten Wladimirs Bildung nach Kräften. Er war ein typischer Vertreter der „sowjetischen Oberprima“ der dreißiger Jahre: überzeugter Komsomolze, Wandzeitungsredakteur, glühender Agitator und Organisator von künstlerischen Rezitationswettbewerben. In einer Zeit, da der Wortkunst eine außerordentliche Bedeutung beim Aufbau der sozialistischen Gesellschaft und der Entwicklung des „neuen Menschen“ zugesprochen wurde, meinte auch er, den geistig anspruchsvollen, zugleich politischen „Beruf“ eines Schriftstellers ergreifen zu müssen. Dass das Land vom Großen Terror erschüttert wurde, registrierte der Schüler Gelfand kaum, denn es tangierte ihn und seine Familie nicht, und Schule wie Presse schienen die richtige Erklärung für den Kampf gegen „Verräter“ und „Klassenfeinde“ zu liefern. Warum er 1940 oder 1941 von der Mittelschule in die Abiturklasse der Arbeiterfakultät für Industrie Dnipropetrowsk überwechselte, ist nicht ganz klar. An der neuen Ausbildungsstätte mit zusätzlicher Berufsausbildung absolvierte er „drei Kurse“. Der Überfall Deutschlands auf die Sowjetunion verhinderte Wladimirs Schulabschluss. Als im August 1941 Betriebe und öffentliche Einrichtungen der Heimatstadt evakuiert wurden, schlugen seine Mutter und er sich nach Jessentuki durch. Wladimir fand Unterkunft bei seiner Tante, die Mutter konnte nicht in seiner Nähe bleiben. Auch der Vater verließ die Ukraine. Gelfand wurde in Jessentuki und dessen Umgebung am Anfang des Krieges bei einfachen Reparaturarbeiten eingesetzt. Im April 1942 meldete er sich an die Front, am 6. Mai 1942 wurde er einberufen. Die Grundausbildung erhielt der Neunzehnjährige in einer kleinen Artillerie-Einheit in der Nähe von Maikop im westlichen Kaukasus. Ihm wurde der Rang eines Sergeanten zugesprochen, er übernahm das Kommando über eine Granatwerferbesatzung. Als die Ölfelder bei Maikop im August 1942 direktes Ziel deutscher Angriffe wurden und die Wehrmacht in den Kaukasus vordrang, war Gelfand bereits nicht mehr dort. Er kämpfte seit Juni auf dem linken Flügel der Südwestfront bei Charkow, die den mächtigen Attacken des Gegners allerdings nicht gewachsen war. Gelfand erlebte einen chaotischen Rückzug im Raum Rostow am Don. Mitte Juli 1942 wurde seine Einheit umzingelt und teilweise aufgerieben. Mit einer kleinen Gruppe gelang es ihm, aus dem Kessel auszubrechen und erneut Anschluss an die 62. Armee unter dem Kommando von Tschuikow, die für Stalingrad kämpfte, zu finden. Anfang August wies man Gelfand einer Eliteeinheit zu, der 15. Garde-Schützendivision, die nahe Stalingrad kämpfte. Eine Verwundung rettete Gelfand vor dem schlimmsten Gemetzel, er kam im Dezember 1942 in ein Lazarett in der Nähe von Saratow, östlich der Wolga. Im Februar 1943 wurde er gesundgeschrieben und in ein Reserve-Schützen-Regiment bei Rostow eingewiesen. Im Sommer 1943 baute Vladimir Gelfand den Briefverkehr mit seiner Mutter erneut auf, die vorher nach Zentralasien evakuiert wurde. Von Ihr erfuhr er, dass fast alle seine Verwandten väterlicherseits im besetzten Jessentuki bei Judenvernichtungsaktionen umgekommen waren. Faschisten brachten in Jessentuki die Großmutter von Wladimir, den Onkel, zwei seiner Tanten und zwei Cousinen um. Überlebt hatten nur der Vater und dessen Bruder, die vor dem Einmarsch der Nazis über Kaukasischen Gebirgen nach Derbent flüchteten. Eine dreimonatige Schulung in Offizierskursen beendete Gelfand als Unterleutnant. Ende August 1943 wurde er in die 248. Schützendivision versetzt, wo er nach kurzem Aufenthalt in der Reserve das Kommando über einen Granatwerferzug übernahm. Die 248. Schützendivision hatte bereits eine wechselvolle Geschichte hinter sich. Zweimal völlig aufgerieben und wieder neu formiert, erhielt sie mit der dritten Aufstellung 1942 gut ausgebildete Kräfte aus verschiedenen Infanterie-Unteroffiziersschulen und Frontlazaretten. Die hochmotivierte Truppe machte sich innerhalb der Verbände der Südfront sehr verdient. Gelfand stieß zu ihr, als die Südukraine befreit wurde. Die Rote Armee schnitt die noch von den Deutschen besetzte Krim ab und attackierte die restlichen deutschen Verteidigungslinien. Gelfands Granatwerferzug wurde südlich von Melitopol eingesetzt. Die 248. Schützendivision wurde im Herbst 1943 in eine Garde-Armee der 3. Ukrainischen Front eingegliedert. Ende Januar 1944 erhielt Gelfand den Rang eines Leutnants. Seit November 1943 war er Vollmitglied der KPdSU(B). Anfang 1944 war Gelfands Einheit in Kämpfe am südlichen Dnepr verwickelt. Gelfand durchlebte sie abwechselnd an der Kampflinie und in der Reserve. Anfang Mai 1944 überschritt seine Einheit den Dnister nahe Grigoriopol. Eine neue Offensive am Südabschnitt der Front führte er im August 1944 nach Bessarabien. Im Herbst 1944 befand sich seine Division im Raum östlich von Warschau. Sein Tagebuch füllte sich mit Notizen über Begegnungen mit der polnischen Zivilbevölkerung. Ende November 1944 war er bereits über zwei Monate außerhalb der Kampfhandlungen. Seine Bummeleien erregten bei Vorgesetzten wiederholt Missfallen. Sogar dem Divisionskommandeur Nikolaj Galaj fiel er auf. Als Gelfand auch noch dessen Frontgeliebte anzuhimmeln begann und sie – auf freundschaftlichen Rat nichts gebend – in Briefen und Gedichten bedrängte, zog er Galajs persönlichen Grimm auf sich. Im Dezember 1944 musste er dem Militärstaatsanwalt sein unerlaubtes Entfernen von der Truppe erklären. Vor Jahresende kehrte Gelfand zu den Granatwerfern der 248. Division zurück. Anfang 1945 bereitete sich die Rote Armee auf zwei gewaltige Angriffsoperationen vor, die Weichsel-Oder-Offensive und die Ostpreußen-Offensive. Einheiten mit insgesamt mehr als drei Millionen sowjetischer Soldaten wurden zu diesem Zweck neu formiert, ausgerüstet und in Stellung gebracht. Den erfolgreichen Offensiven sollte die Schlacht um Berlin folgen. Der Roten Armee stand ein noch immer mächtiger Feind entgegen, der an den Grenzen des eigenen Siedlungsraumes zu hartnäckigem Widerstand bereit war. Am 12. und 13. Januar begannen die sowjetischen Angriffe. Sie führten zu einem dynamischen Kampfgeschehen. Gelfand wurde Anfang Januar 1945 in das 1052. Schützenregiment der 301. Schützendivision versetzt, das in Vorbereitung der Offensive Übungen absolvierte. Die 301. Division gehörte seit Oktober 1944 zur 5. Stoßarmee von Generaloberst Bersarin innerhalb der 1. Belorussischen Front unter Armeegeneral Schukow. Gelfand bekam im 3. Schützenbataillon wieder das Kommando über einen Granatwerferzug, und diesmal ging es wirklich an die vorderste Kampflinie. Vielleicht war es für ihn eine Art Strafversetzung zum Zweck der Bewährung, denn Gelfands alte Division (ebenfalls in der 5. Stoßarmee) besetzte den Aufmarschraum hinter der 301. Am 14. Januar 1945 kam südlich von Warschau am Fluss Pilica nach 25-minütiger Artillerievorbereitung der Befehl zum Angriff in nordwestlicher Richtung. Das 1052. Schützenregiment stieß auf deutsche Infanterie und Panzer, dennoch kamen die sowjetischen Truppen in diesem Abschnitt nach einigen Tagen Stellungskampf unerwartet schnell voran. Binnen zwei Wochen erreichten sie die 1939 von der Wehrmacht überrollte Reichsgrenze. Ende März 1945 wurde Gelfand in den Stab der 301. Division gerufen, um das „Tagebuch der Kampfhandlungen“ (Журнал боевых действий) zu führen. Im Vorfeld der Berliner Operation hatte man sich in Antonows Divisionsstab dafür einen neuen Schreiber ausgesucht – Wladimir Gelfand. So saß er also, während die 301. Schützendivision Mitte April bei Küstrin zum Angriff auf Berlin überging, zuerst in Küstrin, dann westlich der Stadt und schließlich in einem östlichen Vorort von Berlin und verfasste das offizielle Divisionstagebuch. Die ersten Friedenswochen erlebte Gelfand als Stabsoffizier in diversen Einsätzen in und bei Berlin. Anfang Juli 1945 kam er in ein Reserve-Offiziersregiment nahe Rüdersdorf. Nachdem Bersarin Mitte Juni 1945 in Berlin bei einem Verkehrsunfall ums Leben gekommen war, wurde die 5.  Stoßarmee aus Berlin herausgeführt. Zugleich rüsteten die Truppen um. Auch für Gelfand musste ein neuer Einsatzort gefunden werden, und er hoffte auf interessante Einsatz- und Qualifizierungsmöglichkeiten. So bemühte er sich um eine Stelle als Politoffizier und malte sich aus, nach Sprachkursen in der Aufklärung eingesetzt zu werden, etwa bei Gefangenenverhören. Mit Aussicht auf eine Politoffiziers-Karriere – und nur so – schien ihm im August 1945 sogar ein Einsatz im Fernen Osten vorstellbar, nachdem die UdSSR Japan den Krieg erklärt hatte. Im Oktober 1945 bewarb er sich erfolglos für den Dienst in einer Einheit südöstlich von Berlin, dann als Schriftführer in Kremmen, schließlich schien irgendwo eine Stelle als Komsomol-Funktionär in Aussicht. Gelfand wurde hin- und hergeschoben, auch weil seine Personalakte, wie er selbst feststellen konnte, schlechte Zeugnisse enthielt. Die schlechte Beurteilung hatte wohl mit seiner Weigerung zu tun, die Plünderung der deutschen Bibliothek aus Kräften zu unterstützen. Als sich im Oktober 1945 eine Stelle in einem Materialstützpunkt bot, die mit 700 bis 750 Rubel Grundgehalt hinlänglich attraktiv war, willigte er ein. Gelfands Stützpunkt war eine technische Versorgungsbasis (База материалов и оборудования) bei Kremmen, nordwestlich von Berlin, die der 21. selbständigen Trophäenbrigade unterstellt war. Dort diente er bis zu seiner Demobilisierung im September 1946. Ihre Transportabteilung beschäftigte zunächst drei, Anfang 1946 dann sechs Offiziere sowie technisches Personal aus den unteren Rängen. Leutnant Gelfand stellte Waren- und Materiallieferungen an sowjetische Einheiten zusammen und begleitete sie, organisierte den Transport von Demontage- und Reparationsgut. Bei seiner Arbeit pendelte er ständig zwischen Nauen, Potsdam, Velten, Kremmen, Hennigsdorf, Schönwalde, Fürstenberg und Berlin. Kurzzeitig setzte man ihn Anfang 1946 in einem Kremmener Sägewerk als Produktionsleiter ein, wo ihm sechs Soldaten und zwei Pferdegespanne unterstanden. Im Stützpunkt hatte er stets auch Wachdienste zu übernehmen. Im Frühjahr 1946 wurde Gelfand für drei Monate gänzlich nach Berlin abkommandiert. Der Demobilisierungsbefehl trägt das Datum vom 10. September 1946. Im September 1947 begann er ein Studium an der Staatlichen Universität Dnipropetrowsk. 1949 heiratet er Berta Dawidowna, geborene Koifman. Ihre Eltern zogen bald nach Molotow (heute Perm). Im Jahr 1950 wurde der Sohn Alexander geboren. Ab August 1952 arbeitete Wladimir als Lehrer für Geschichte sowie russische Sprache und Literatur an der Eisenbahner-Fachschule Nr. 2 in Molotow. Die Ehe mit Berta geriet bald in eine Krise. 1954 verließ Gelfand Frau und Sohn und kehrte nach Dnipropetrowsk zurück. Er nahm eine Stellung als Lehrer an einer städtischen Technischen Fachschule an. 1952 schloss Wladimir Gelfand sein Studium an der Universität Molotow ab. Er schrieb eine Diplomarbeit über Ilja Ehrenburgs Roman „Sturm“ von 1947. Wladimir wurde von Ehrenburg in Moskau zu einem Gespräch empfangen. 1957 lernte er Bella Jefimowna Schulman kennen. Er trug ihr an, mit nach Dnipropetrowsk zu gehen. Bella willigte ein und fand in der Einraumwohnung von Wladimirs Mutter Aufnahme, wo neben Wladimir mittlerweile auch dessen Vater wieder wohnte. Er ließ sich von seiner ersten Frau scheiden. Aus der Ehe mit Bella gingen zwei Söhne hervor. 1959 wurde Gennadi, 1963 Witali geboren. Die Eltern arbeiteten hart, aber aufgrund starken Antisemitismus bekamen beide keine Lehrerstelle in der Zehnklassenschule. Gelfand blieb zeitlebens Lehrer in Berufsschulen, zuerst in der 12., ab 1977 in der 21. Technischen Fachschule der Stadt Dnipropetrowsk. Er gründete einen Geschichtszirkel, lud Zeitzeugen ein und baute mit Schülern ein kleines Museum aus Erinnerungsstücken von Kriegsveteranen der Region auf. Zu seinen Unterrichtsfächern gehörten Ethik und Politökonomie. Für einen Zusatzverdienst übernahm er gelegentlich in den Schulferien Vorlesungen im Auftrag eines Bildungsvereins. Er blieb aktives Parteimitglied, übernahm auch Funktionen in der Parteigruppe der Schule. Dort fanden zeitweise harte Auseinandersetzungen statt. Antisemitische Schmähungen im Lehrerkollektiv und sogar von Seiten der Geschichtslehrer-Kollegen waren keine Seltenheit. Ende der 1960er Jahre erstritt seine Frau mit Eingaben und Anträgen eine Mietwohnung für die Familie des Kriegsteilnehmers und Lehrers. Nach über zehn Jahren kamen die vier Gelfands aus ihren zehn Quadratmeter Wohnraum heraus. Wladimirs Mutter nahmen sie in die Dreiraumwohnung mit, sein Vater lebte damals schon nicht mehr. Doch die Zeit arbeitete gegen ihn, und das gesellschaftliche Umfeld bot immer weniger Raum für kritische Rückschau. Als er in den 1970er Jahren endlich Gelegenheit bekam, Fragmente seiner Kriegserinnerungen zu veröffentlichen, konnte sich Gelfand zudem der Schere im eigenen Kopf nicht erwehren. So zitierte er die Verse, die er 1945 am Reichstag und 1946 an der Siegessäule hinterließ, nie wieder im Original. Statt ihrer findet sich in seinem ganzseitigen Artikel Der Sieg in Berlin im Sowetski Stroitel vom 25. April 1975 ein angeblich in Berlin hinterlassener Vers, in welchem die ursprünglichen Zeilen „Und schaue und spucke auf Germanien – Auf Berlin, das besiegte, spucke ich“ ersetzt waren durch die harmlosen „Schaut her, hier bin ich, Sieger über Deutschland – In Berlin habe ich gesiegt.“ Die selbst angelegte Artikelsammlung umfasst sieben Beiträge aus dem Jahr 1968, 20 aus dem Jahr 1976, 30 aus dem Jahr 1978. Sie erschienen in ukrainischer und russischer Sprache in den lokalen Partei- und Komsomolzeitungen sowie in Zeitungen für Bauarbeiter. Gelfands Mutter starb 1982, sein Vater 1974. |
G;|Simon Wiesenthal, KBE (* 31. Dezember 1908 in Butschatsch, Galizien, heute Ukraine; † 20. September 2005 in Wien) war ein österreichisch-jüdischer Überlebender des Holocaust sowie Architekt, Publizist und Schriftsteller. Nach seiner Befreiung aus dem Konzentrationslager Mauthausen im Mai 1945 machte Simon Wiesenthal die „Suche nach Gerechtigkeit für Millionen unschuldig Ermordeter“ zu seiner Lebensaufgabe. Dadurch wurde er zu einem Zeitzeugen des Holocaust, der weltweit Tätern aus der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus nachforschte, um sie einem juristischen Verfahren zuzuführen. Er gründete das Dokumentationszentrum Jüdische Historische Dokumentation in Linz und später das Dokumentationszentrum des Bundes Jüdischer Verfolgter des Naziregimes in Wien. Wiesenthal verstand sich nicht als „Nazijäger“, wie er im Laufe der Zeit sowohl anerkennend von Anhängern als auch ablehnend von Kritikern bezeichnet wurde. Wiesenthal sah sich selbst eher als Rechercheur, der jene zur Verantwortung ziehen wollte, die an der geplanten „Endlösung der Judenfrage“ mitgewirkt hatten. Entsprechend lehnte er die Kollektivschuldthese nach einem frühen Umdenken ab. Wiesenthal sah in seiner Tätigkeit unter anderem die Pflichterfüllung, als Zeitzeuge und Überlebender des Holocaust vor dem Vergessen der Shoah zu warnen, die nicht mit Massenmord und Gaskammern begonnen habe, sondern mit der Demontage von Demokratie und Menschenrechten. Seine internationale Vortragstätigkeit stand deshalb unter dem Leitspruch „Aufklärung ist Abwehr“. Als Autor zahlreicher Bücher, die in mehrere Sprachen übersetzt wurden, wollte Wiesenthal ein Vermächtnis für nachfolgende Generationen hinterlassen.  Vorkriegszeit und Holocaust Wiesenthal war der Sohn des Zucker-Großhändlers und Offiziers des Vielvölkerstaates Österreich-Ungarn Hans Wiesenthal, der bereits 1915 im Ersten Weltkrieg starb. In Buczacz, das ab 1918 zu Polen gehörte, überlebte Simon Wiesenthal als Zwölfjähriger nur knapp ein Pogrom marodierender Kosaken. Nach seiner Matura 1928 wurde er wegen einer Quotenbeschränkung gegenüber jüdischen Studenten nicht für das Polytechnische Institut in Lemberg (Lwiw) zugelassen. Stattdessen studierte er Architektur an der Technischen Universität in Prag und schloss sein Studium 1932 mit dem Ingenieurdiplom ab. 1936 heiratete er seine jüdische Schulfreundin Cyla Müller, eine entfernte Verwandte Sigmund Freuds, und eröffnete in Lemberg ein Architekturbüro. Nach der sowjetischen Besetzung Ostpolens im Jahr 1939 wurde der jüdische Stiefvater inhaftiert und enteignet. Schließlich starb er an den Folgen der Haft. Wiesenthal musste sein Architekturbüro schließen. Er durfte nur noch als Techniker arbeiten. Nach dem deutschen Überfall auf die Sowjetunion 1941 wurde Wiesenthal im Juli des Jahres als Jude von Angehörigen des Wehrmacht-Bataillons Nachtigall in Lemberg verhaftet. Er arbeitete schon damals mit der polnischen Widerstandsorganisation zusammen. Diese Kontakte nutzte er zur Rettung seiner Frau, so dass sie der Deportation entkam und unter dem Namen Irena Kowalska zuerst nach Warschau flüchtete. Mit einem falschen Pass wurde sie zur Zwangsarbeit ins Rheinland verschleppt und konnte unerkannt überleben. Nach seiner Verhaftung in Lemberg zwangen deutsche SS- und Wehrmacht-Angehörige Männer der Stadt, sich auf dem Marktplatz neben manngroßen Holzkisten aufzustellen. Die Erschießungen begannen. Um 12 Uhr mittags läuteten die Glocken der Kirche. Einer rief „Schluss jetzt, Vesper“ (Originalinterview mit S. Wiesenthal) und etwa 10 bis 20 Mann vor Simon Wiesenthal hörte das Morden auf. Daraufhin wurde er in ein KZ gebracht. Simon Wiesenthal war in insgesamt zwölf Arbeits- und Konzentrationslagern inhaftiert, darunter den KZ-Stammlagern Groß-Rosen und Buchenwald, dem Internierungslager Plaszów und dem Ghetto Lemberg. Anfang Mai 1945 kam er durch die US-Armee aus dem KZ Mauthausen in Oberösterreich frei. Nach dem Holocaust Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg kam er sofort mit den zuständigen amerikanischen Behörden in Kontakt und übergab bereits am 20. Mai 1945 eine Liste mit 91 nationalsozialistischen Verbrechern. Schon im Juli wurde er von den Amerikanern beauftragt, Adolf Eichmann zu suchen. Erst Ende 1945 sah er seine Frau Cyla wieder. Seine einzige Tochter, Pauline, wurde 1946 geboren. Er gründete 1947 in Linz die Jüdische Historische Dokumentation, die sich unter anderem zum Ziel setzte, von Zeugen erhaltene Informationen auszuwerten sowie Karteien zu Tätern und Tatorten anzulegen. Das Büro in Linz schloss er 1954, da sich auf dem Höhepunkt des Kalten Krieges kaum eine staatliche Organisation für seine Ermittlungen einsetzte und er daher keine Unterstützung bekam. In dieser Zeit arbeitete er in der Weiterbildung für jüdische Flüchtlinge, die ohne Beruf kaum eine Chance zur Auswanderung hatten. 1961 gründete er in Wien erneut ein Jüdisches Dokumentationszentrum. Auch dieses Zentrum konnte nur aufgrund von Spenden arbeiten. Simon Wiesenthal berichtete, wie seine 9-jährige Tochter Pauline von der Schule nach Hause gekommen sei und gefragt habe: Was sind wir für Menschen? Alle aus der Klasse haben Oma, Opa, Onkel, Tanten, warum haben wir niemanden? Darauf habe er nicht antworten können und sei in Tränen ausgebrochen. Er berichtete, wie ihn das Grauen und das Morden in Träumen und Gedanken immer wieder heimgesucht habe: Dann lag ich in der Nacht schweißnass. Das Ehepaar Wiesenthal verlor im Holocaust 89 Verwandte. Seine Schlafstörungen bekämpfte Wiesenthal mit dem akribischen Sammeln von Briefmarken, vorwiegend aus seiner galizischen Heimat. Bereits 1953 hatte Wiesenthal mit Hilfe von Briefmarkenfreunden Eichmann in Argentinien aufgespürt. 1954 fand er einen Vermittler, der bereit war, Eichmann zu identifizieren. Jedoch fehlten 500 US-Dollar für dessen Fahrtkosten. Wiesenthal bat den damaligen Präsidenten des Jüdischen Weltkongresses, Nahum Goldmann, um diesen Betrag, er lehnte jedoch ab. Daraufhin gab Wiesenthal sein Wissen an die israelische Regierung weiter. Im Mai 1960 wurde Eichmann von israelischen Agenten nach Israel entführt und im Eichmann-Prozess in Jerusalem vor Gericht gestellt. Bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt hatte Eichmann mit Hilfe von argentinischen Diplomaten, Funktionären der katholischen Kirche und auch der CIA unbehelligt in Argentinien leben können. Eichmann war neben John Demjanjuk der einzige Nationalsozialist, der in Israel vor Gericht gebracht wurde. Später bestritt der frühere Mossadchef Isser Harel, dass Wiesenthal bei der Ergreifung Eichmanns geholfen habe. Tom Segev, Wiesenthal-Biograf und israelischer Journalist, bestätigte aber im Juni 2006 die Existenz eines Schreibens von Wiesenthal an den Jüdischen Weltkongress aus dem Jahr 1954, worin er auf den Aufenthalt Eichmanns in Argentinien hinwies. Tom Segev schrieb in seiner Biografie auch, dass Wiesenthal jahrelang mit dem israelischen Mossad zusammenarbeitete. Er erhielt ein Monatsgehalt des Geheimdienstes und regelmäßig Besuch von Agenten aus Israel. Mit dem Geld finanzierte Wiesenthal die Arbeit seines Dokumentationszentrums. Zu den bekanntesten Tätern, die Wiesenthal neben Eichmann ausfindig machte, zählte 1963 Karl Silberbauer in Wien, der 1944 die damals 15-jährige Anne Frank in Amsterdam verhaftet hatte. Silberbauer arbeitete bis dahin unerkannt als Wiener Kriminalrayoninspektor. Seine Aufdeckung war Wiesenthals schwierigster Fall, da auch in Österreich alte Seilschaften von Nationalsozialisten aktiv wurden. 1967 fand er den KZ-Kommandanten des Vernichtungslagers Treblinka, Franz Stangl, Franz Murer und 1987 in Brasilien den ehemaligen Ghettokommandanten von Przemyśl, Josef Schwammberger. Der Gestapo-Chef von Lyon, Klaus Barbie, bekannt als „Schlächter von Lyon“, arbeitete als Folterspezialist zuerst mit dem CIC zusammen und tauchte dann 1951 in Bolivien unter. Dort spürte ihn das Ehepaar Serge und Beate Klarsfeld auf, worauf er unter Wiesenthals Mithilfe 1983 nach Frankreich ausgeliefert wurde. Franz Murer, der „Schlächter von Vilnius“, wurde auf Wiesenthals Betreiben mehrmals vor Gericht gestellt. Murer wurde 1948 an die Sowjetunion ausgeliefert und in Vilnius zu 25 Jahren Zuchthaus verurteilt. Die Todesstrafe wurde damals wegen einer Gesetzesänderung nicht gegen ihn verhängt. 1955 wurde er, den Vereinbarungen im Staatsvertrag entsprechend, an Österreich ausgeliefert, aber damals von der österreichischen Justiz nicht weiter verfolgt. Erst 1962 kam es nach Intervention von Simon Wiesenthal zur neuerlichen Verhaftung und einem Prozess in Graz, der mit einem skandalösen Freispruch endete. Franz Murer lebte bis an sein Lebensende, auch nach wiederholten Versuchen, ihn erneut vor Gericht zu stellen, in Gaishorn am See, Bezirk Liezen. Er war noch zuletzt Bezirksbauernvertreter der ÖVP. Im Prozess standen ihm prominente Fürsprecher vor allem aus dem Lager der ÖVP zur Seite. Da in Österreich eine zentrale Staatsanwaltschaft fehlt, wurden zahlreiche NS-Prozesse nicht geführt. Lediglich 20 Personen wurden seit 1955 in Österreich verurteilt, 23 Personen (darunter zum Teil mit skandalösen Urteilen) sprach man frei. In seinem Memorandum im Jahr 1966 an die ÖVP-Regierung kritisierte Wiesenthal das Desinteresse österreichischer Behörden an der Ausforschung und Strafverfolgung von NS-Tätern in Österreich. Seine Feststellung blieb folgenlos, denn Staatsanwälte und Polizisten waren stets überlastet, Ermittlungen wurden verzögert, ehemalige NS-Angehörige befanden sich unter den ermittelnden Beamten, zu deutschen Parallelprozessen wurden keine Prozessbeobachter entsandt. Ohne Simon Wiesenthals unermüdliches Engagement wäre eine Vielzahl von Ermittlungen gegen zum Teil auch prominente Täter nicht zustande gekommen. Insgesamt wurden seit 1955 etwa gegen 5.500 Personen Erhebungen geführt, die meisten davon jedoch nicht nachdrücklich genug. Die wenigen Prozesse in Österreich trugen lediglich der außenpolitischen Notwendigkeit Rechnung, überhaupt NS-Prozesse zu führen. Nachdem 1972 die zwei Erbauer der Auschwitzer Krematorien, Fritz Ertl und Walter Dejaco, und 1975 Johann Gogl, einst Schlächter in Mauthausen, von den österreichischen Geschworenen freigesprochen worden waren, schien Wiesenthal vorübergehend zu resignieren: In Österreich bleiben etwa 800 Nazis, gegen die ermittelt wurde, unbestraft. Besonders bitter für die vom Holocaust Betroffenen ist diese Bilanz auch deshalb, weil es unmittelbar nach 1945 durchaus ernsthafte Versuche gegeben hatte, NS-Täter zu verfolgen; dafür zuständig waren die „Volksgerichte“. Sobald die Belasteten aber ab 1949 als Wähler interessant wurden, erlahmte das Interesse der ÖVP-SPÖ-Koalition an der Aufklärung von NS-Verbrechen. Konflikte 1975 entstand zwischen Wiesenthal und dem österreichischen Bundeskanzler Bruno Kreisky ein Disput um die SS-Vergangenheit des FPÖ-Vorsitzenden Friedrich Peter, der als Kreisky-Peter-Wiesenthal-Affäre in die Geschichtsbücher einging. Kreisky warf Wiesenthal im Zuge dieser Affäre ohne Beweise vor, mit der Gestapo kollaboriert zu haben. Wiesenthal erklärte in einem Fernsehgespräch 1978, die Zeit dieser Angriffe seitens Kreiskys sei für ihn die schlimmste seit seinem Aufenthalt im Konzentrationslager gewesen. Ein Gerichtsbeschluss verurteilte Kreisky zu einem Bußgeld für seine Unterstellungen. Der Jüdische Weltkongress (WJC) engagierte sich 1986 maßgeblich für eine Untersuchung der Vergangenheit des damaligen österreichischen Präsidentschaftskandidaten Kurt Waldheim (siehe auch „Waldheim-Affäre“). Waldheim wurde beschuldigt, falsche Angaben zu seinen Tätigkeiten während des Zweiten Weltkrieges im besetzten Griechenland sowie zu seinen Mitgliedschaften gemacht zu haben. Erst schrittweise räumte Waldheim seine Beschönigungen ein, allerdings war er nie ein SS-Mitglied, wie es ihm anfänglich Vertreter des WJC unterstellt hatten. Als bereits gewählter Bundespräsident wurde Waldheim vor allem auf Betreiben des Jüdischen Weltkongress in den Vereinigten Staaten 1987 auf die „Watch List“ gesetzt, was ein Einreiseverbot für ihn als Privatperson bedeutete. Wiesenthal nahm gegenüber Waldheim eine differenziertere Haltung ein und forderte stattdessen eine Historikerkommission. Diese wurde auch von der österreichischen Regierung eingesetzt und kam zu dem Schluss, dass Waldheim keine persönliche Schuld an Kriegsverbrechen trage, ihm aber Mitwisserschaft von Deportationen griechischer Juden und das Verschweigen und Beschönigen seiner Tätigkeiten während des Krieges anzulasten seien. 1996 beschuldigte Eli Rosenbaum, der frühere »general counsel« bzw.Chefsyndikus oder -anwalt des Jüdischen Weltkongresses, Wiesenthal, bei der Suche nach den wichtigsten Kriegsverbrechern versagt zu haben und unterstellte ihm niedrige Beweggründe. Dieser Vorwurf schadete Wiesenthals Ansehen jedoch nur vorübergehend. Für Aufsehen sorgte eine Sendung des NDR-Magazins Panorama am 8. Februar 1996. Redaktionsleiter Joachim Wagner ließ neben einigen jüdischen Zeugen vor allem Eli Rosenbaum seine Vorwürfe wiederholen, wie jenen einer übertriebenen Darstellung der Erfolge Wiesenthals und sogar einer Obstruktion in laufenden Ermittlungen. Die FAZ (14. Februar 1996) sah darin den „Versuch einer Hinrichtung“. Wiesenthals Reaktion blieb gelassen: „Mein Lebenswerk lässt sich nicht von ein paar Leuten, die ja selbst kaum etwas getan haben, mit Hilfe quotensüchtiger Fernsehjournalisten zunichte machen.“ (SZ, 12. Februar 1996). Gefährliche Bedrohungen blieben bestehen, 1982 entging er nur knapp einem Bombenanschlag des Neonazis Ekkehard Weil. Späte Anerkennung 1977 wurde das nach ihm benannte Simon Wiesenthal Center mit Hauptsitz in Los Angeles gegründet. Ziel des Zentrums war und ist es bis heute, flüchtige Kriegsverbrecher und Nazis zu verfolgen. Inzwischen sind weitere Institute in New York, Miami, Toronto, Jerusalem, Paris und Buenos Aires gegründet worden. Zunächst empfand Simon Wiesenthal es als große Ehre, dass das Simon Wiesenthal Center nach ihm benannt wurde. Dessen Leiter, Marvin Hier, vermittelte ihm zahlreiche Vorträge, Preise und Ehrungen in den Vereinigten Staaten. Es gelang ihm nicht, Simon Wiesenthal mit dem Nobelpreis ehren zu lassen. In späteren Jahren fühlte sich Simon Wiesenthal häufig übergangen oder schlecht informiert, so dass sich die Konflikte häuften. Marvin Hier gelang es immer wieder, ihn zu besänftigen. Simon Wiesenthal hinterließ dem Simon Wiesenthal Center seinen Schreibtisch mit der dahinter aufgehängten Landkarte. 1989 wurde sein Leben in dem mehrfach preisgekrönten Spielfilm Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story (deutscher Titel: Recht, nicht Rache) mit Ben Kingsley als Simon Wiesenthal verfilmt. Auf seine Initiative hin wurde das Mahnmal für die österreichischen jüdischen Opfer der Shoa am Wiener Judenplatz errichtet, seither die zentrale Gedenkstelle für die ermordeten österreichischen Juden. 2003 zog sich Wiesenthal in den Ruhestand zurück. In einem Rückblick auf sein Lebenswerk meinte er, seine Ziele weitgehend verwirklicht zu haben (NZZ, 25. April 2003). Seine Arbeit wird nun von Efraim Zuroff vom Jerusalemer Wiesenthal-Center vor allem in osteuropäischen Ländern weitergeführt. Am 10. November 2003 starb seine Ehefrau Cyla. Sie wurde in der Neuen Israelitischen Abteilung des Wiener Zentralfriedhofs beigesetzt. 2004 wurde Wiesenthal von der britischen Königin Elisabeth II. zum Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) ernannt. Die Bedeutung dieser Auszeichnung ist daran zu erkennen, dass für britische Bürger damit die automatische Erhebung in den Adelsstand verbunden ist. Wiesenthal wurden die Ordensinsignien vom britischen Botschafter in Wien bei einem Besuch in seinem Haus überreicht. Am 9. Juni 2005 wurde ihm von Bundespräsident Heinz Fischer das Große Goldene Ehrenzeichen für Verdienste um die Republik Österreich verliehen. Während der Kreisky-Wiesenthal-Affäre war Fischer Klubobmann der SPÖ gewesen und hatte einen Untersuchungsausschuss gegen Wiesenthal vorgeschlagen, der allerdings nicht zustande kam. Im Präsidentschaftswahlkampf 2004 distanzierte sich Fischer öffentlich von seiner damaligen Initiative: Ich würde heute anders und reifer handeln und es tut mir leid, dass ich damals keinen besseren Weg zur Bereinigung des Konflikts gefunden habe. Simon Wiesenthal starb am 20. September 2005 in seinem Haus in Wien Döbling im Alter von 96 Jahren. Er hinterließ seine Tochter Pauline Kreisberg, drei Enkel und sieben Urenkel in Israel. Eine Trauerfeier, bei der Bundespräsident Fischer und Bundeskanzler Schüssel Reden hielten, fand in der Neuen Israelitischen Abteilung des Wiener Zentralfriedhofs statt. Wiesenthals letzter Wille war es, in Israel begraben zu werden. Er wurde am 23.

September 1989 in Troisdorf) ist eine deutsche Tennisspielerin. 2013 stand sie in Wimbledon als erste Deutsche seit Steffi Graf 1999 im Einzelfinale eines Grand-Slam-Turniers.  Kindheit und Jugend Lisicki, deren Eltern 1979 als Aussiedler aus Polen kamen, begann im Alter von sieben Jahren Tennis zu spielen. Trainiert wurde sie zunächst von ihrem Vater Richard, einem promovierten Sportwissenschaftler, der als Tennistrainer in Eckenhagen arbeitete. Dort besuchte sie auch die Grundschule, danach eineinhalb Jahre das Wüllenweber-Gymnasium Bergneustadt. Mit 10 Jahren spielte sie für Rot-Weiß Troisdorf. 2003 zog sie mit ihren Eltern nach Berlin, wo sie sich dem LTTC Rot-Weiß Berlin anschloss. Erste Erfahrungen auf dem ITF Circuit sammelte sie mit 15 Jahren. 2004 besiegte sie beim WTA-Turnier in Berlin unter anderem Cara Black – damals Nummer 2 der Doppel-Weltrangliste. Im Jahr darauf musste sie nach einem Ermüdungsbruch im Fuß geraume Zeit pausieren. 2007 gewann sie auf Jersey und in Toronto ihre ersten ITF-Titel. Zugunsten ihrer Karriere verließ sie das Gymnasium nach der Mittleren Reife. 2008 Anfang 2008 konnte sich Lisicki endgültig auf der WTA Tour etablieren, als sie die Qualifikation bei den Australian Open überstand. In der ersten Runde bezwang sie die an 16 gesetzte Dinara Safina mit 7:6, 4:6 und 6:2, in Runde zwei die Ukrainerin Marija Korytzewa. In der dritten Runde traf sie auf die damals 17-jährige Caroline Wozniacki, der sie sich trotz einer 6:4-, 4:2-Führung noch geschlagen geben musste. Im Februar 2008 berief sie Teamchefin Barbara Rittner ins deutsche Fed-Cup-Team. Bei ihrem Debüt in La Jolla holte sie in der Erstrundenbegegnung gegen die USA (1:4-Niederlage) den einzigen Punkt für das deutsche Team. Lisicki besiegte die frühere Weltranglistenerste Lindsay Davenport mit 6:1, 7:5, ehe sie im zweiten Einzel Ashley Harkleroad nur knapp unterlag. Auf dem Weg ins Achtelfinale von Key Biscayne schlug sie mit Anna Tschakwetadse erstmals eine Spielerin aus den Top 10. Im Auftaktmatch ihres „Heimturniers“ in Berlin gewann sie gegen die Nummer 18 der Welt, Shahar Peer, glatt in zwei Sätzen. Trotz ihres Ausscheidens nach einem engen Match gegen Sybille Bammer in Runde zwei löste sie mit Platz 89 der Weltrangliste am 12. Mai 2008 Martina Müller als beste deutsche Tennisspielerin ab. Bei den French Open kam sie mit einem Zweisatzerfolg über Jelena Wesnina in die zweite Runde, wo sie der an Position 12 gesetzten Ágnes Szávay unterlag. Nach fünf Erstrundenniederlagen in Folge erreichte sie in Cincinnati das Viertelfinale, das sie gegen die an 3 gesetzte Maria Kirilenko in drei Sätzen verlor. Bei den US Open kam sie mit einem Sieg über María José Martínez Sánchez in die zweite Runde, in der sie Aljona Bondarenko in drei Sätzen unterlag. Im Oktober stand Lisicki bei den Taschkent Open erstmals im Finale eines WTA-Turniers, das sie gegen Sorana Cîrstea knapp mit 6:2, 4:6 und 6:74 verlor. 2009 Im Januar trat sie beim Hopman Cup in Perth an der Seite von Nicolas Kiefer für Deutschland an. Das Aus kam allerdings bereits in der Vorrunde, da Kiefer verletzungsbedingt aufgeben musste. Im April gewann Lisicki ihr erstes WTA-Turnier. Beim Family Circle Cup in Charleston triumphierte sie im Endspiel mit 6:2, 6:4 über Caroline Wozniacki. Im gesamten Turnier gab sie keinen einzigen Satz ab, auch nicht gegen die ehemalige Weltranglistenerste Venus Williams. Bei der Fed-Cup-Partie Ende April gegen China siegte sie sowohl im Einzel (gegen Zheng Jie mit 6:4, 2:6, 6:4) als auch im Doppel mit Anna-Lena Grönefeld (gegen Zheng Jie und Peng Shuai mit 4:6, 7:5, 6:2). Das Team schaffte mit einem 3:2-Sieg den Aufstieg in die Weltgruppe I. Beim Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart bezwang Lisicki zu Beginn Patty Schnyder mit 6:4, 6:3, verlor dann aber gegen die an 3 gesetzte Jelena Janković mit 5:7, 7:5 und 3:6. Das Drittrundenspiel der Estoril Open gegen Anna-Lena Grönefeld musste Lisicki beim Stande von 2:6 verletzt aufgeben. Zuvor hatte sie gegen Kirsten Flipkens mit 6:2, 6:2 und gegen Jelena Bowina mit 6:4, 7:5 gewonnen. Bei den French Open schied sie bereits in Runde eins mit 2:6, 6:1, 1:6 gegen Lucie Šafářová aus. Bei den AEGON International in Eastbourne verlor sie auf Rasen beide Erstrundenbegegnungen, im Einzel gegen Samantha Stosur mit 2:6, 1:6 und im Doppel zusammen mit Ana Ivanović gegen die Ranglistenersten Cara Black und Liezel Huber. In Wimbledon schlug sie zu Beginn die an 32 gesetzte Anna Tschakwetadse mit 4:6, 7:64, 6:2. In der zweiten und dritten Runde konnte sie die Österreicherin Patricia Mayr (6:2, 6:4) und die an 5 gesetzte Swetlana Kusnezowa (6:2, 7:5) bezwingen. Im Achtelfinale bezwang sie erneut Wozniacki (6:4, 6:4), im Viertelfinale unterlag sie dann der Weltranglistenersten Dinara Safina mit 7:65, 4:6 und 1:6. Die Hartplatzturniere in den USA und in Asien verliefen wegen zahlreicher Verletzungen, vor allem im Schulterbereich, enttäuschend. Auch die US Open waren für sie nach der zweiten Runde zu Ende. In Luxemburg stieß Lisicki ins Finale vor, das gegen die Schweizerin Timea Bacsinszky mit 2:6, 5:7 verloren ging. Beim Commonwealth Bank Tournament of Champions kam sie am Jahresende mit einem Sieg und einer Niederlage nicht über die Gruppenphase hinaus. Sabine Lisicki wurde 2009 vom Deutschen Tennis Bund mit dem „Deutschen Tennispreis“ in der Kategorie „Profi weiblich“ für herausragende Leistungen und Erfolge in der zurückliegenden Saison ausgezeichnet. 2010 Wegen einer hartnäckigen Sprunggelenksverletzung am linken Fuß (Lisicki musste in Indian Wells und Miami aufgeben) war sie zwischen Ende März und Anfang August nicht am Start. Nach viereinhalb Monaten Pause verlor sie ihr Auftaktmatch in Cincinnati gegen die rumänische Qualifikantin Monica Niculescu ebenso glatt in zwei Sätzen wie ihr Erstrundenmatch gegen Kristina Barrois bei den Bronx Open, einem ITF-Turnier. Nach einem glatten Zweisatzsieg über die US-Amerikanerin Coco Vandeweghe schied sie bei den US Open in Runde zwei gegen die an Position 7 gesetzte Wera Swonarjowa aus. 2011 Beim ASB Classic in Auckland erreichte Lisicki nach Siegen über Sania Mirza (Qualifikation) und Florencia Molinero die zweite Runde, wo sie Yanina Wickmayer in drei Sätzen unterlag. Bei den Sony Ericsson Open in Miami war in der dritten Runde Schluss. Bei den French Open unterlag sie in der zweiten Runde erneut Swonarjowa in drei Sätzen, wobei sie im dritten Satz beim Stand von 5:2 einen Matchball vergab. Sie verausgabte sich bei diesem Match bis zur Erschöpfung, so dass sie nach dem Spiel am Boden liegend von Helfern auf einer Trage vom Platz gebracht werden musste (als Ursache wurde eine Glutenallergie angegeben). Beim Vorbereitungsturnier auf Wimbledon in Birmingham stieß Lisicki mit einem umkämpften Zweisatzsieg über Magdaléna Rybáriková bis ins Halbfinale vor, wo sie auch Peng Shuai bezwang (6:3, 6:1). Im Endspiel konnte sie Daniela Hantuchová ebenso klar (6:3, 6:2) besiegen und damit ihren zweiten Erfolg auf der WTA Tour feiern. In Wimbledon beförderte Lisicki nach einem 6:1-, 6:1-Auftaktsieg über Anastasija Sevastova aus Lettland die Weltranglistenvierte Li Na, die zuvor als erste Asiatin in Paris triumphiert hatte, in der zweiten Runde mit 3:6, 6:4, 8:6 aus dem Turnier. Mit einem mühelosen Sieg über Misaki Doi und einem weiteren Zweisatzsieg über Petra Cetkovská (7:63, 6:1) erreichte sie das Viertelfinale. Dort schlug sie Marion Bartoli mit 6:4, 6:74 und 6:1 und zog erstmals in ihrer Karriere und als erste Deutsche seit Steffi Graf (1999) ins Halbfinale eines Grand-Slam-Turniers ein. Nach Zheng Jie (2008) war Lisicki erst die zweite Spielerin, die mit einer Wildcard in Wimbledon das Halbfinale erreichte. Dort behielt die Nummer 5 der Setzliste, Marija Scharapowa, allerdings mit 6:4, 6:3 die Oberhand. Im Doppel-Halbfinale konnte sich Lisicki dagegen mit ihrer Partnerin Samantha Stosur gegen Tamarine Tanasugarn und Marina Eraković mit 6:3, 4:6, 8:6 durchsetzen und erstmals für das Endspiel eines Grand-Slam-Turniers qualifizieren. Dort unterlag das Duo Květa Peschke und Katarina Srebotnik mit 3:6, 1:6. Zum Auftakt der Hartplatzsaison erreichte sie beim WTA-Turnier in Stanford das Halbfinale, verlor dort aber klar gegen die spätere Siegerin Serena Williams. In der darauf folgenden Woche kam sie in San Diego ins Viertelfinale, wo sie sich der Weltranglistendritten Swonarjowa wieder in drei Sätzen geschlagen geben musste. Beim WTA-Turnier in Cincinnati verlor sie ihr Auftaktmatch gegen Shahar Peer mit 4:6 und 6:7, nachdem sie sich im zweiten Satz nach einem 0:5-Rückstand bis auf 5:6 herangekämpft hatte. Beim WTA-Turnier in Dallas, bei dem sie an Nr. 5 gesetzt war, unterstrich sie ihre Form, als sie ohne Satzverlust bis ins Finale stürmte und mit einem 6:2-, 6:1-Sieg über Aravane Rezaï ihren dritten Einzeltitel auf der Tour sicherte. Bei den US Open kam Lisicki bis ins Achtelfinale, unterlag dort aber in zwei Sätzen erneut Wera Swonarjowa. 2012 Beim Turnier in Auckland musste sie ihr Viertelfinalmatch gegen Angelique Kerber aufgeben. Bei den Australian Open unterlag sie im Achtelfinale Maria Scharapowa mit 6:3, 2:6, 3:6. Bei der Fed-Cup-Begegnung gegen Tschechien verlor sie überraschend beide Einzel (Dreisatzniederlagen gegen Iveta Benešová und Petra Kvitová). In Doha unterlag sie bereits zum Auftakt Angelique Kerber mit 6:4, 4:6, 1:6. Beim WTA-Turnier in Dubai erreichte Lisicki (nach einem Freilos in Runde eins) mit einem Sieg über Iveta Benešová (6:3, 6:3) das Viertelfinale, wo sie gegen Agnieszka Radwańska jedoch chancenlos war. Bei den French Open kam das Aus bereits in Runde eins. Nach mehreren Niederlagen in den Auftaktrunden konnte Lisicki in Wimbledon erstmals wieder die erste Runde überstehen. Sie zog ins Achtelfinale ein, wo sie in zwei Sätzen die topgesetzte Weltranglistenerste Scharapowa klar besiegte. Im Viertelfinale verlor sie gegen Kerber. Bei den Olympischen Spielen 2012 in London trat Lisicki im Einzel und zusammen mit Kerber im Doppel an. Im Einzel schied sie im Achtelfinale knapp in drei Sätzen gegen Scharapowa aus. Im Doppel gewannen Lisicki und Kerber ihr Auftaktspiel, blieben im Achtelfinale gegen die späteren Goldmedaillengewinnerinnen Serena und Venus Williams chancenlos. Im Mixed trat sie mit Christopher Kas an, mit dem zusammen sie noch kein Spiel bestritten hatte. Nach zwei Siegen unterlagen die beiden im Halbfinale Laura Robson und Andy Murray in drei Sätzen. Im Spiel um Bronze mussten sie sich anschließend ebenfalls geschlagen geben, gegen die US-Amerikaner Lisa Raymond und Mike Bryan verloren sie mit 3:6, 6:4, [4:10]. 2013 Zu Beginn des Jahres traf Lisicki beim Turnier in Brisbane in Runde zwei auf die Weltranglistenerste Wiktoryja Asaranka, gegen die sie 3:6, 3:6 verlor. Bei den Australian Open musste sie gegen die an Nummer 10 gesetzte Caroline Wozniacki antreten. Im gesamten Match machte sie 57 vermeidbare Fehler und musste trotz einer 3:0-Führung im dritten Satz am Ende eine Niederlage (6:2, 3:6, 3:6) hinnehmen – es war ihr frühestes Ausscheiden in Melbourne. Am 21. Januar gab Lisicki auf ihrer Homepage Ricardo Sánchez als neuen Trainer bekannt. Beim WTA-Turnier in Pattaya stand sie nach Siegen über Tatjana Maria, Alexandra Panowa, Marina Eraković und Nina Brattschikowa erstmals seit April 2011 wieder in einem Finale. Bis dahin musste sie im gesamten Turnier nur einen Satz abgeben (in der Viertelfinalpartie gegen Eraković). Das Finale verlor sie gegen Marija Kirilenko knapp mit 7:5, 1:6 und 6:71. In der Rangliste verbesserte sie sich um zwölf Plätze auf Position 40. Eine Woche später gewann sie ihr Einzel im Fed Cup gegen Pauline Parmentier mit 7:5, 7:5 und sorgte so für das 2:0 gegen Frankreich. In der Bundesligasaison 2013 trat Lisicki für den TC Rüppurr an. Nach drei Monaten mit Ricardo Sánchez wechselte sie bereits im April zu Trainer Robert Orlik. Ende Mai erfolgte ein weiterer Wechsel zum Belgier Wim Fissette, von dem sie sich im September wieder trennte. Bei ihrer fünften Wimbledonteilnahme zog Lisicki zum vierten Mal ins Viertelfinale ein. Im Achtelfinale gegen die Weltranglistenerste Serena Williams (6:2, 1:6, 6:4) verlor sie zwar neun Spiele in Folge, konnte aber dennoch das Match für sich entscheiden. Es war ihr vierter Sieg gegen eine aktuelle French-Open-Siegerin in Wimbledon und der zweite gegen eine Weltranglistenerste. Zuvor hatte sie bereits Francesca Schiavone, Jelena Wesnina und Samantha Stosur besiegt. Im Viertelfinale setzte sie sich gegen Kaia Kanepi glatt in zwei Sätzen durch und stand damit nach 2011 zum zweiten Mal im Halbfinale, in dem sie Agnieszka Radwańska mit 6:4, 2:6, 9:7 bezwang. Als erste Deutsche seit Steffi Graf 1999 im Dameneinzel-Finale von Wimbledon musste sie sich Marion Bartoli mit 1:6, 4:6 geschlagen geben. Beim letzten Grand-Slam-Turnier des Jahres, den US Open, scheiterte Lisicki in der dritten Runde gegen Jekaterina Makarowa mit 4:6 und 5:7. 2014 Das Jahr 2014 begann Lisicki in Brisbane mit einem Auftaktsieg gegen Magdaléna Rybáriková. Zum Zweitrundenmatch konnte sie jedoch nicht antreten. Bei den Australian Open schied sie in der zweiten Runde gegen Monica Niculescu nach einem Dreisatzmatch aus. Auch beim nächsten Turnier in Pattaya konnte sie das Zweitrundenmatch wegen Krankheit nicht bestreiten. In Dubai scheiterte sie bereits in Runde eins. Bei den BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells schied sie nach einem Freilos in der zweiten Runde aus. In Miami konnte sie zu ihrer Achtelfinalpartie abermals nicht antreten, gewann aber an der Seite von Martina Hingis die Doppelkonkurrenz. In Charleston folgte das Aus im Achtelfinale gegen Andrea Petković, in Stuttgart scheiterte sie bereits in der ersten Runde. In Madrid gelangen ihr erstmals in diesem Jahr zwei Siege in Folge, ehe sie Simona Halep unterlag. Beim Sandplatzturnier in Rom kam sie nicht über die erste Runde hinaus. Beim Turnier in Roland Garros musste sie in der zweiten Runde gegen Mona Barthel aufgeben. Eine deutliche Steigerung gelang ihr mit dem Viertelfinaleinzug in Wimbledon. Beim folgenden Turnier in Stanford verlor sie zwar ihr Auftaktmatch gegen Ana Ivanović, stellte mit 211 km/h aber einen neuen Aufschlag-Weltrekord auf. In Montréal unterlag sie im Achtelfinale. Im September konnte sie in Hongkong zum ersten Mal seit Wimbledon 2013 wieder ein Finale erreichen, in dem sie Karolína Plíšková besiegte. 2015 Am 18. Juni 2015 gelangen Lisicki beim Spiel gegen Belinda Bencic beim AEGON Classic Birmingham 27 Asse und damit ein neuer WTA-Rekord für die meisten Asse in einem Spiel. Bei den US Open erreichte sie das Achtelfinale. Danach musste sie wegen Knieproblemen pausieren. 2016 Im Mai 2016 trennte sich Lisicki von ihrem Trainer Christopher Kas und nach nur drei Monaten von dessen Nachfolger Salvador Navarro. 
G;|Johann Klör, auch Johann Kloer, (* 16. April 1751 in Leutershausen; † 18. März 1818 in Würzburg) war ein Obstbauer, Imker, Leinenweber und Kleinbauer. Er war innerhalb der damaligen Gesellschaft von niederem Stand, schaffte es durch Fleiß und Strebsamkeit zu geringem Wohlstand und erreichte überdauernde Bekanntheit durch seine Biografie, die Franz Oberthür im Zeichen der Aufklärungsliteratur über ihn schrieb.  Kindheit und Wanderjahre Klör wurde in Leutershausen im damaligen Hochstift Würzburg nahe Bad Neustadt an der Saale geboren. Sein Vater war Leinenweber und der örtliche Gemeindehirte. Von Kindheit an musste Klör seinen Vater bei diesen Tätigkeiten unterstützen. Er beschäftigte sich seit seiner Jugend mit Bienen. Ein Bruder seiner Mutter war Imker und unterrichtete ihn. Mit neunzehn begab er sich auf Wanderschaft als Webergeselle. Sein Ziel war dabei, auch die Herstellung von Weberblättern zu erlernen. Schon im ersten Jahr seines Wanderlebens, nachdem er mit sechs Kameraden den ersten Meister verlassen hatte, weil diese keine Arbeit mehr hatte, wurde Brot so teuer und knapp, dass er, unterwegs mit einigen Kameraden auf dem Weg spessartabwärts nach Aschaffenburg, oft auch für Geld keines kaufen konnte und hungern musste. Oft mussten sie sich von rohen Getreideähren ernähren und sie mussten mehrere kranke und ermattete Mitgesellen zurücklassen. In Neuwied verloren sie einen weiteren Kameraden an einen Seelenverkäufer, wie damals Menschenhändler genannt wurden. Mit seinem letzten verbliebenen Kameraden heuerte Klör auf einem Schiff an, um nach Holland zu kommen und dort vielleicht Seemann zu werden. Bei Linz am Rhein musste ihr Schiff wegen eines Sturms anlegen. Nur seinem Kapitän verdankte es Klör, dort nicht auch in die Hände von Menschenhändlern gelangt zu sein. Weiter zur See wollte er daraufhin mit seinem Kameraden nicht fahren und die beiden wanderten über Köln nach Elberfeld, wo sie in einer Kunstweberei Arbeit fanden. Die Arbeit, bei der er viel lernte, gefiel Klör. Wegen der Beschäftigung in einem Kellergewölbe musste er sie aber zu seinem Leidwesen aus gesundheitlichen Gründen beenden. Sie wanderten zurück nach Köln, wo sein Mitgeselle von Menschenhändlern gekidnappt wurde. Über Trier und Koblenz ging Klör zurück nach Neuwied, wo er auf einem Jagdschiff, welches nach Mainz und Frankfurt fuhr, als Ruderer Arbeit fand. Von Mainz ging er nach Herchsheim (heute Giebelstadt) und verdingte sich als Drescher, weil es für Weber keine Beschäftigung gab. Durch Zufall traf er dort den zuletzt verschwundenen Kameraden wieder, dem es gelungen war, seinen Häschern zu entkommen. Mit ihm blieb er während der nächsten Zeit zusammen. Im November wurde Klör krank und es gelang ihnen nicht, eine Herberge zu finden, obwohl er zu der Zeit 40 Gulden besaß. Während ungeschützter Übernachtungen im Freien zog er sich Erfrierungen an den Füßen zu. Nachdem er wieder unter Schmerzen laufen konnte, wanderte sie nach Mainz, wo er sich im Haus der Weberzunft gesund pflegen konnte. Über einen Zeitraum von mehreren Wochen mit teils mehrwöchigen Pausen gelang es ihm, unter Schmerzen nach Hause zu laufen. Nach sieben Wochen machte er sich wieder auf den Weg. Wegen Fiebers musste er nach kurzer Zeit wieder in seine Heimat zurückkehren. Er brauchte ein halbes Jahr zur Genesung. Er lernte Harfe zu spielen, bevor er wieder, diesmal mit dem Instrument, loszog. Fand er in der folgenden Zeit der Wanderschaft keine Beschäftigung als Weber, spielte er auf Tanzveranstaltungen Harfe. Einmal wurde er in Miltenberg Opfer falscher Verdächtigungen, dass er ein „Streuner“ und Deserteur sei. Obwohl ihm die Meister der dortigen Weberzunft glaubten, dass die Anschuldigungen falsch waren, besorgte er Leumundszeugnisse, um sämtliche Zweifler auch unter den Gesellen und Dorfbewohnern von seiner Unschuld zu überzeugen. Im letzten Jahr seiner Wanderschaft wurde der „Harfenhannes“, wie er wegen seines Instruments genannt wurde, auf dem Weg von Miltenberg zur Kirchweih in Marktheidenfeld, wo er spielen sollte, auf Weisung des Sohnes vom Miltenberger Amtsvogt grundlos auf offener Straße von würzburgischen Husaren verprügelt und misshandelt. Er zog, nachdem es bei seinem Meister in Miltenberg keine Arbeit mehr gab, mit Musikanten bis in die Niederlande. Von dort ging es nach Straßburg, von wo er auf Umwegen, immer wieder Beschäftigung als Weber suchend, im Alter von 27 Jahren nach Hause zog. Während seiner Wanderungen war er auch eine Zeitlang als Messer- und Scherenschleifer beschäftigt, was ihm später hilfreich war, da er auch diese Arbeiten für sich und seine später von ihm konstruierten Maschinen selbst übernehmen konnte. Spätere Jahre Zurück in Leutershausen heiratete Klör Margaretha Feller (1751–1816) und wurde Vater von zwei Söhnen und einer Tochter. Das Harfespiel betrieb Klör auch in den folgenden Jahrzehnten weiter. Während seiner Reisen hatte Klör schon versucht, sich möglichst viel Wissen im Obstbaumschnitt und Veredeln von Obstbäumen anzueignen. Er hielt sich für geeignet, nach seiner Heimkehr als im damaligen Sinne angesehener Bürger und Handwerksmeister dieses Wissen unter seinen Mitbürger auch zu verbreiten und praktisch umzusetzen. Seine Söhne arbeiteten später als Weber und stellten Weberblätter her wie ihr Vater. Auch seine Begeisterung für die Obstkultur und die Imkerei teilten sie. Klör hatte sie schon frühzeitig auf seinen Reisen mitgenommen. Auf diesen Reisen hatte Klör selbst oft mehrtägige Umwege in Kauf genommen, wenn er glaubte, irgendwo etwas Neues im gegenseitigen Austausch von Wissen, lernen zu können. So besuchte er, teilweise in Begleitung seiner Söhne, ab 1791 Johann Ludwig Christ alle zwei Jahre. Klör war oft unterwegs, sowohl um Hilfsmittel für seine Weberblattherstellung zu kaufen als auch um die fertigen Blätter und seine gewebten Stoffe zu verkaufen. Diese Reisen zu Fuß machte er hauptsächlich in Thüringen, Sachsen und dem Rheinland. Auf einer dieser Reisen besuchte er 1791 auf Vermittlung von Ludwig Geßner, damals Pfarrer der Pfarrei Brend, zu der Leutershausen zugehörig war, welcher selbst als Bienenzüchter und Pomologe tätig war, Johann Ludwig Christ in Kronberg. Er traf Christ in dessen Baumschule an und blieb acht Tage in Kronberg. Gemeinsam veredelten sie junge Bäume und tauschten sich über pomologische Fragen aus, wobei Klör das Veredlungsschnittverfahren von Christ erlernte. Da Klör in Kronberg gesehen hatte, dass dort fast jeder Bürger einen Obstbaumgarten angelegt hatte, tat er dies, bestärkt in dem Entschluss durch eine Rundschreiben der Regierung, dass in jedem Ort Industriegärten (Schulgärten) angelegt werden müssen, auch. Gegen den Widerstand missliebiger Nachbarn, die ihm in den Folgejahren mehrfach Bäume und den das entsprechende Grundstück umgebenden Zaun zerstörten, hatte er damit langfristig einen erfolgreichen Geschäftszweig begründet. Mehrfach erweiterte er seine Gartenfläche durch Zukauf von Nachbargrundstücken. Auch in der Landeshauptstadt Würzburg hatte man von seinem Können gehört und die Landes-Schul-Kommission beauftragte ihn, die Schullehrer in den Dörfern im Anlegen und der Pflege der Schulgärten zu unterweisen und auch Bericht zu erstatten über den Zustand der Gärten. Er bereiste dazu fünfzehn Landgerichtsbezirke in Franken. Während einige Lehrer ihn freundlich empfingen und froh waren, sich weiterbilden zu können, ließen andere ihn spüren, dass sie sich schämten, von einem Mann niedrigen Standes, der nur zu Fuß reisen konnte, belehrt zu werden. In den meisten Orten, in die Klör in der Funktion als Beauftragter kam, fand er Schulgärten. Diese waren allerdings meist in einem ungepflegten Zustand und vom Nutzen von Obstbäumen hatten die wenigsten Lehrer etwas gehört. Wo er keine Gärten vorfand, half er diese mit Hinweis auf den Befehl zur Anlage durch Franz Ludwig von Erthal auszumessen und herzurichten. Gleichzeitig verkaufte er auf diesen Reisen selbst gezogene Obstbäume und Edelreiser. Nachdem Klör die fünfzehn Bezirke bereist hatte, war er als Regierungsbeauftragter in Randersacker. Nachdem er dort einiges gerügt hatte, wurde er vom Ortsvorstand ins Gefängnis eingesperrt, da er das Beglaubigungsschreiben der Regierung nicht dabei hatte und sich somit nicht ausweisen konnte. Nach dieser Episode wurde sein staatlicher Auftrag von der Schul-Kommission beendet. Auch ohne diese Legitimation hat er in den folgenden Jahren, wenn er gefragt wurde, gerne jedem, insbesondere von den von seinen Inspektionsreisen bekannten, mit Rat und Tat geholfen. Als im benachbarten Sachsen ein Gesetz erlassen wurde, nachdem Baumschulen anlegt und Baumwärter einstellt werden mussten, wurde Klör von der Gemeinde Rohr (heute Thüringen) angefragt, ob er den gewählten aber unkundigen Baumwärter, unterstützen könne. Klör erklärte sich dazu bereit. Nach acht Jahren, in denen entweder Klör oder einer seiner Söhne mindestens einmal im Frühjahr geholfen hatten, standen in Rohr 1422 veredelte Obstbäume. Auf seinem Weg dorthin hatte er auch den Baumwärter in Dietzhausen angeleitet, ohne dort Entlohnung zu verlangen. Für die Brüder Sigismund und Christian Ernst von Rotenhan in Rentweinsdorf legte Klör Gärten und Bienenstöcke an und unterwies die dortigen Arbeiter, wie sie diese zu pflegen hatten. Leutershausen war ein Ganerbendorf, in dem die Gerichtsbarkeit zwischen dem begüterten Edelmann und dem Hochstift Würzburg geteilt war. Um 1800 gab es im Dorf, das zur Pfarrei Brend gehörte, weder eine Schule noch eine Kirche. 1802 wurde Klör ausgewählt, Spenden zu sammeln, mit denen eine Kirche finanziert werden sollte. Mit den von Klör gesammelten 2.000 Gulden wurden die zwei Gebäude gebaut. Dabei hatte dieser neben seiner Arbeitsleistung, die sich während der Bauzeit nicht auf das Sammeln beschränkte, sondern unter anderem auch darin bestand, dass er selbst Bauholz herbeischaffte, noch weitere 108 Gulden aus seinem privaten Besitz ausgegeben. Am Ende der Bauzeit gab es im Dorf Ärger und Streit, weil Klör auf Anweisung des Pfarrers einheitliche Gesangbücher und eine schwarze Tafel aus Holz zum Notieren der Lieder besorgt hatte. Man warf Klör vor, er ließe sich als Werkzeug benutzen, um die katholische Gemeinde lutherisch zu machen. Im folgenden Aufruhr wurde er verhaftet und verbrachte drei Tage im Gefängnis des Ganerben, der die Niedere Gerichtsbarkeit ausübte, und musste zusätzlich 7 Gulden Strafe zahlen, um frei zu kommen. Dies geschah, nachdem der Schultheiß im Namen der Gemeindemitglieder mit einer Klage beim Landgericht als Träger der Gerichtsbarkeit des Großherzogtum Würzburg keinen Erfolg gehabt hatte und das Landgericht sich gegen eine Entfernung der Tafeln ausgesprochen hatte. Der Streit beschäftigte die Gemeinde, Klör und das Landgericht noch bis 1808. Nachdem die Tafel zweimal entfernt worden war und die Täter, darunter einmal Klörs Sohn, bestraft wurden, war sie im Herbst 1808 verschwunden und konnte nicht wieder gefunden werden. Als Folge dieses Streits war Klör die Erlaubnis, Spenden zu sammeln, entzogen worden. Nachdem ihm diese auf mehrmaliges Bitten nicht wieder erteilt wurde, klagte er gegen die Gemeinde, um ausstehende Kosten seinerseits gedeckt zu bekommen. Kurze Zeit nach dem Kirchbau errichtete er für sich und seine Familie ein neues Wohnhaus in seinem Obstgarten. Es war neben dem damaligen gemeindlichen Brauhaus erbaut und es kam in der Folge zu Grenzstreitigkeiten mit der Gemeinde, die von Oberthür so kommentiert werden, dass Klör zu gutmütig war. Klörs Vorsatz, nicht nur als Webermeister tätig zu sein, sondern auch die benötigten Weberblätter selbst herzustellen, beschäftigte ihn auf seinen Reisen lange auf der Suche nach einer Lösung, bessere und regelmäßigere Blätter zu produzieren. Fünfzehn Jahre lang hatte er sich überlegt, wie man diese maschinell herstellen könne. Nachdem er auf einer Geschäftsreise nach Rheine erfahren hatte, das es in Krefeld eine solche Maschine gebe, machte er sich auf den Weg dorthin. In der Gegend von Worms sagte ihm ein Berufskollege, dass er eine solche Maschine nahe Frankenthal finden könne. Diese besichtigte er und baute sie mit Hilfe eines Schlossermeisters aus Gersfeld und eines Uhrmachermeisters verbessert nach. Er selbst und jeder seiner Söhne betrieben später je eine dieser Maschinen. Sein jüngerer Sohn Johann hatte diese soweit verbessert, das er auch aus Stahl Weberblätter für die Tuch- und Seidenweberei herstellten konnte und nicht nur für die Leinenweberei. Insgesamt beschleunigten die maschinell hergestellten Blätter die Weberei bei ihm und seinen Kunden um rund ein Drittel, weil die Blätter gleichmäßiger gefertigt waren und somit weniger zu Arbeitsunterbrechungen kam wie bei den vorher von Hand gefertigten. In seiner Biografie findet sich eine in aller Ernsthaftigkeit wiedergegebene Schilderung, dass Klör einen sächsischen durchziehenden Soldaten während des Vierten Koalitionskriegs von Erfrierungen durch Auflegen eines rohen Herings heilte. Dieses Mittel hätte auch beim ihm während seiner Wanderschaft als Geselle gewirkt. Auch wenn zur damaligen Zeit mehrfach die Wirksamkeit dieser Behandlung, angeblich von höchsten militärischen Stellen, bestätigt wurde, ist es aus heutiger Sicht eher ein Beitrag zur Kulturgeschichte. Klör selbst hielt ungefähr 100 Bienenvölker. Später hatte er auch gemeinsame Bienenstöcke mit anderen Imkern unter anderem im 40 km entfernten Kaltennordheim. Er war weit über die Ortsgrenzen als Experte für Imkerei bekannt, wurde oft um Rat gefragt und hielt Vorträge auf seinen Reisen. Aufgrund seiner Fertigkeiten waren seine Königinnen begehrt bei anderen Imkern. Das Vertrauen der anderer Imker fand darin seinen Ausdruck, dass diese ihn „Bienenvater“ nannten. Er war zeitweise staatlich beauftragter Bienenzuchtinspektor im Großherzogtum Würzburg. In späterem Alter wollte er seine Lebenserfahrungen und auch sein Wissen über die Pomologie und die Bienenzucht einem von ihm eingestellten Gesellen diktieren. Deshalb kam es erstmals zu einem größeren Streit mit seiner Frau. Er hatte als Webermeister zwar das Recht, einen Gesellen zu beschäftigen. Seine Frau hatte allerdings kein Verständnis dafür, dass dieser mit in ihren Augen nutzlosen Tätigkeiten beschäftigt wurde. Nachdem sie schon einige beschriebene Blätter verbrannt hatte, wandte sie sich um Hilfe an den örtlichen Schultheiß, der sie anfänglich beim Versuch unterstützte, den „Fremden“ aus dem Dorf zu vertreiben. Klör bewirkte einen Beschluss beim Landgericht, dass er seinen Schreiber behalten dürfe. Einer der Gründe, weshalb Klör seine Erfahrungen aufschreiben ließ, war, dass die staatliche Schul-Kommission seine Anleitungen zur Obst- und Bienenzucht als Handbuch verteilen lassen wollte. Weiter war er von „angesehenen Männern aus der Hauptstadt (Würzburg)“ gebeten worden, seine Lebenserinnerungen aufzuschreiben. Wegen der Erstellung des Kupferstichs für die von Franz Oberthür erstellte Biografie wurde er als eitel verspottet. In den ersten Monaten des Jahres 1818 stürzte Klör während einer seiner geschäftlichen Wanderungen in Thüringen nachts in einen Wassergraben, woraus er erst nach Stunden befreit wurde. Danach war er gezwungen, noch zwei Stunden durch Schneematsch zu laufen, um den Botenwagen nach Würzburg noch zu erreichen. Dort erkrankte er und verstarb nach einem Aderlass und dem Empfang der Letzten Ölung im Alter von 67 Jahren an einer Lungenentzündung. Sein Sohn Andreas war zu der Zeit Bürger und Bienenzüchter in Reyersbach und sein zweiter Sohn Johann Bürger, Blätterbinder und Baumpflanzer im heimischen Leutershausen. |
G;|Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Ulrich Moritz von Hirschfeld (* 4. Juli 1790 in Halberstadt; † 13. Oktober 1859 in Koblenz) war ein preußischer General der Infanterie. Bekannt wurde er als Offizier der spanischen Armee im Krieg mit Frankreich von 1810 bis 1815 und als Befehlshaber im Feldzug gegen die Revolution von 1849 in der Pfalz und in Baden  Herkunft, Kindheit und Jugend Moritz von Hirschfeld war ein Sohn des preußischen Generals Karl Friedrich von Hirschfeld aus dessen erster Ehe mit Karoline Friederike Philippine von Faggyas (1761–1795). Ab Januar 1803 war er Zögling der Kadettenanstalt in Berlin. Anlässlich seines 14. Geburtstags stellte ihn der Vater in das von ihm kommandierte Regiment „Garde“ in Potsdam als Gefreiterkorporal ein. Hirschfeld besuchte seit 1804 Lehrveranstaltungen Scharnhorsts auf der Schule für junge Offiziere. Im November 1805 wurde er Fähnrich im Bataillon „Leibgarde“ des Regiments. Im Feldzug von 1806/07 nahm Hirschfeld an der Schlacht bei Auerstedt teil und geriet Ende Oktober 1806 in die Kapitulation bei Prenzlau, in deren Folge das Regiment aufgelöst wurde. Auf sein Ehrenwort, in diesem Krieg „bis zur Auswechslung nicht zu dienen“, erlangte Hirschfeld die Freiheit. Inaktiv und auf halbes Gehalt gesetzt, kehrte er nach Hause zurück. Sein älterer Bruder, der Husarenleutnant Eugen von Hirschfeld, war in Kolberg zuerst dem Freikorps Schill beigetreten, hatte dann aber im Dezember 1806 in Stargard zusammen mit seinem Bruder, dem Infanterieleutnant Alexander Adolf von Hirschfeld ein eigenes Freikorps aufgestellt, das bis zum Frieden von Tilsit bestand. Eugen und Moritz von Hirschfelds Heimat gehörte nun zum Königreich Westphalen. Sie erhielten keine Stelle in der preußischen Armee und wurden auf Halbsold gesetzt. Beide bereiteten in ständigem Kontakt mit aktiven preußischen Offizieren einen Aufstand gegen die französischen Besatzer vor. Die Erhebung von 1809 Im April 1809 begann Österreich gegen Frankreich einen Befreiungskrieg, der in ganz Deutschland als Volkskrieg geführt werden sollte. Die weitverzweigten Planungen sahen im Rahmen des Dörnbergschen Aufstands eine handstreichartige Besetzung der Festung Magdeburg durch Freischaren unter Friedrich von Katte und den Gebrüdern Hirschfeld vor. Infolge des Fehlschlags Dörnbergs ging das Überraschungsmoment verloren und das Vorhaben musste in letzter Stunde aufgegeben werden. Die alarmierten Franzosen trieben bei Burg die bereits versammelte Formation der Brüder Hirschfeld auseinander. Beide versteckten sich auf Schloss Eichenbarleben, von wo aus sie mithilfe ihrer Verwandten Minettchen von Alvensleben (1777–1852) auf preußisches Gebiet flüchten konnten. Gemeinsam mit Katte schlossen sie sich der Schwarzen Schar unter dem Herzog Friedrich Wilhelm von Braunschweig an und erreichten London. Eugen trat auf Empfehlung Braunschweigs als Major in den britischen Dienst und erhielt im Juni 1810 die Erlaubnis, mit halbem Gehalt nach Spanien zu gehen, um auf dem iberischen Kriegsschauplatz in den Reihen der spanischen Armee den Kampf gegen Napoleon fortzusetzen. Moritz von Hirschfeld folgte ihm drei Monate später als Leutnant mit britischem 2/3-Gehalt. Der Herzog von Braunschweig hatte ihn nach selbst vorgenommener Offiziersprüfung befördert. In Spanien Moritz von Hirschfeld folgte seinem Bruder nach Cádiz, dem Zentrum des spanischen Widerstands gegen Napoleon, Sitz der Junta Suprema Central und Versammlungsort der Verfassunggebenden Cortes. Die belagerte Hauptstadt Spaniens war auf dem europäischen Festland der aussichtsreichste Treffpunkt jener Deutschen, die nach den misslungenen Aufständen von 1809 weiterkämpfen wollten, wie Karl von Grolman und Leopold von Lützow. Die Brüder Hirschfeld erhielten Offiziersstellen im Kavallerieregiment „Alcántara“ in Katalonien, das sie im September 1810 nach einer Seereise durchs Mittelmeer erreichten. Eugen wurde am 14. Januar 1811, inzwischen Oberst, an der Spitze der Avantgarde des Generals Pedro Sarsfield bei einem Angriff auf die französische Division Palombini bei Pla de Cabra schwer verwundet und starb am Tag darauf in den Armen seines Bruders. Moritz von Hirschfelds Erfolge im Kleinen Krieg veranlassten General Enrique José O’Donnell ihn mit der Überrumpelung der Zitadelle von Barcelona, des Fort Monjuich zu beauftragen. Das Unternehmen schlug fehl, doch kamen seine Ergebnisse einer erfolgreichen Gewaltsamen Aufklärung gleich und Hirschfeld wurde Rittmeister. Bei der Eroberung von Figueres im April 1811 erwarb er sich die „Goldene Medaille für Tapferkeit“. Sein Regiment befand sich im Juni im belagerten Tarragona. Am Abend vor der Eroberung entkam Hirschfeld mit seiner Eskadron aus der eingeschlossenen Festung. Nach schweren Verwundungen in der verlorenen Schlacht von Murviedo am 25. Oktober 1811 hatte Hirschfeld einen Gnadenstoß in den Kopf erhalten und lag zwei Tage für tot gehalten, entkleidet auf dem Schlachtfeld. In ein Massengrab gelegt und erst dann als lebend erkannt, kam Hirschfeld in ein Lazarett nach Saragossa in Gefangenschaft. Kurz vor seiner Genesung gelang ihm im Sommer 1812 die Flucht und die Rückkehr zur spanischen Armee. Infolge der Verwundungen war Hirschfeld zunächst dienstunfähig und konnte den linken Arm nie mehr voll gebrauchen, was seine Reitfähigkeit einschränkte. Die in Spanien übliche Untersuchung einer Reinigungskommission erbrachte ihm ein Lob, veröffentlicht anlässlich seiner Rehabilitierung in einem Armeebefehl vom 1. Februar 1813. Nun einem Infanterieregiment zugeteilt, stieg er zum Major auf. Zu weiteren Einsätzen fehlen Angaben. Wegen seiner ausgezeichneten Kenntnisse der englischen Sprache und der Verhältnisse in der britischen Armee kann angenommen werden, dass er von Katalonien zur Armee Arthur Wellesleys ins Baskenland versetzt wurde. Hirschfeld hatte bei Beginn des Befreiungskrieges in Deutschland im Frühjahr 1813 um seinen Abschied ersucht, um in die preußische Armee zurückzukehren. Stattdessen wurde er 1814 zum spanischen Oberstleutnant befördert, machte den Vormarsch nach Frankreich mit und durfte auch nach dem Pariser Frieden von 1814 nicht ausscheiden. Dies geschah erst am 24. Februar 1815 nach einer Intervention des preußischen Gesandten in Madrid. Im Frühjahr 1815 kam Hirschfeld nach Preußen zurück. Weil er in Spanien hohes Ansehen erworben hatte, zeichnete ihn König Ferdinand VII. nachträglich mit dem Militärischen San Fernando-Orden II. Klasse aus. Als Hirschfelds Sohn Urban Karl, ein preußischer Major, Spanien 1860 bereiste, paradierte vor ihm auf Befehl der Königin Isabella II. das Regiment „Alcantara“, worin sein Vater und sein Onkel gedient hatten. Friedensjahre Weil der 25-jährige Hirschfeld mit Abstand der jüngste Oberstleutnant der preußischen Armee gewesen wäre, stellte sie ihn im September 1815 als Major ein. Hirschfeld übernahm das Kommando des Füsilier-Bataillons im 25. Infanterie-Regiment. In der langen Friedenszeit bis 1849 stieg er vom Oberstleutnant 1830, seit 1831 Kommandeur des 29. Infanterie-Regiments, über den Oberst 1837, ab 1838 Kommandeur der 15. Infanterie-Brigade bis zum Generalmajor 1840 auf. Am 18. Januar 1833 hatte ihn der Großherzog Leopold von Baden mit dem Kommandeurkreuz des Ordens vom Zähringer Löwen dekoriert. Im Frühjahr 1846 wurde Hirschfeld zum Kommandeur der 1. Division in Königsberg ernannt und 1847 zum Generalleutnant befördert. Beachtung fand in der Armee seine Kriegserfahrung aus „sieben Feldzügen“, zu der erfolgreiche, selbständige Kommandos über gemischte Verbände gehört hatten. Seine Vorgesetzten bescheinigten Hirschfeld die Berechtigung zu einem „höheren Wirkungskreis“, zur „außerordentlichen Beförderung“ und „im Falle eines Krieges“ zu „besonderem Vertrauen“. Von ihm sei „viel zu erwarten“. In der Reichsverfassungskampagne König Friedrich Wilhelm IV. rief Hirschfeld während der Märzrevolution im Juni 1848 ins Rheinland zurück und ernannte ihn zum Kommandeur der 15. Division und zum Kommandanten ad interim von Köln. Im Mai 1849 stellte Preußen zwei improvisierte Armeekorps unter dem Oberkommando des Prinzen von Preußen auf, um im Auftrag des Deutschen Bundes den Aufstand in der Pfalz und in Baden niederzuschlagen. Hirschfeld übernahm die Führung des Ersten der beiden Korps. Chef seines Stabes war Oberstleutnant Albrecht von Roon. Hirschfelds Korps besetzte von Norden und Westen aus zwischen dem 11. und 18. Juni „methodisch und behutsam“ die Pfalz, wozu auch der Entsatz der von bayerntreuen Offizieren gehaltenen Festung Landau am 18. Juni gehörte. Die von Daniel Fenner von Fenneberg organisierten pfälzischen Revolutionstruppen zogen sich nach Gefechten bei Homburg, Kirchheimbolanden, Dürkheim, Ludwigshafen und Rinnthal auf die aufständische badische Armee in der Neckargegend zurück. Diese stand bei Mannheim und Heidelberg dem preußischen II. Korps unter Karl von der Groeben und dem Bundeskorps Eduard von Peuckers gegenüber. Zu ihrer Überraschung griff sie Hirschfeld nicht in der Flanke an, sondern setzte am 20. Juni bei Germersheim über den Rhein und befand sich damit in ihrem Rücken. Hirschfeld näherte sich Bruchsal, als die Hauptmacht der badischen Armee unter Ludwik Mierosławski die Vorhut seines linken Flügels angriff. Daraus entwickelte sich am 21. das Gefecht bei Waghäusel. Mieroslawski, verwechselte dabei seinen Gegner Moritz von Hirschfeld mit dessen Bruder Alexander Adolf von Hirschfeld, den er wegen seiner Rolle im Großpolnischen Aufstand im Jahr 1848 als seinen „Todfeind“ ansah. Er wollte nun an ihm „Rache nehmen“, hatte aber nach Anfangserfolgen Mühe, der Einkreisung durch Gefechte bei Ubstadt und Durlach zu entgehen. Am 25. Juni nahm Hirschfeld Karlsruhe ein. Er vereinigte sich mit den Korps Groeben und Peukert. Die Kampfmoral der Aufständischen war durch ihre Niederlage bei Waghäusel und die Nachrichten vom Zusammenbruch der Revolution in Paris und dem russischen Einmarsch in Ungarn schwer erschüttert. Mieroslawski erwartete die Gegner in einer befestigten Stellung südlich der Murg. Hirschfelds Korps durchbrach in Einzelgefechten, so bei Kuppenheim und Muggensturm, vom 28. bis 30. Juni 1849 den linken Flügel der Aufstandsarmee, während ihr von rechts nach dem verlorenen Gefecht in Gernsbach erneut die Einkreisung drohte. Diesmal ging ihr Rückzug in Flucht über und Mieroslawski legte sein Kommando nieder. Ein Teil der Aufstandsarmee rettete sich in die Festung Rastatt, die Groebens Korps einschloss. Der Rest, den Hirschfeld verfolgte, kam nicht mehr zum Stehen und die Truppen lösten sich größtenteils auf. Am 7. Juli 1849 nahm Hirschfeld Freiburg im Breisgau ein, den letzten Sitz der Revolutionsregierung. Zu Kämpfen war es dabei nicht gekommen, weil ein Stimmungswechsel stattgefunden hatte und sich zahlreiche badische Revolutionssoldaten in preußische Gefangenschaft begaben. Hirschfeld ließ sie alle sofort frei. Während Hirschfelds Korps das südliche Baden besetzte, übertraten Mitte Juli die letzten Aufständischen die Schweizer und die französische Grenze, wo sie ihre Waffen niederlegten. Mit der Kapitulation der eingeschlossenen Festung Rastatt vor Groeben endete der Feldzug am 23. Juli 1849. Das 19.400 Mann starke Korps Hirschfelds hatte nach fünfwöchigem Einsatz den Verlust von über 50 Toten und 400 Verwundeten zu beklagen. Der Fall Dortu Die herzogstreuen Bürger Freiburgs hatten anlässlich der Übergabe ihrer Stadt den bereits inhaftierten Max Dortu, der Major der Aufstandsarmee und ehemaliger preußischer Landwehrunteroffizier war, an Hirschfeld ausgeliefert. Er ließ Dortu vor ein Kriegsgericht stellen, das ihn wegen Kriegsverrat am 11. Juli zum Tode verurteilte. Dortu verzichtete auf ein Gnadengesuch. Sein Vater, der ihn besuchen durfte, bat ebenfalls nicht um Gnade, aber um ein Gespräch mit Hirschfeld. Er wurde abgewiesen. Hirschfeld hatte das Urteil, weil es offenbar Rechtsmängel enthielt, zur Überprüfung durch die nächsthöhere Instanz nach Berlin gesandt. Dies verursachte das Missfallen des Königs. An seinen Bruder und präsumptiven Nachfolger Wilhelm, Hirschfelds Vorgesetzten, schrieb er: „Dortü musste 12 Stunden nach seiner Kaptur kalt sein. Statt dessen lässt sich Hirschfeld ein Gutachten von einem demokratischen Auditeur machen, und der ganze Effekt fällt in den Brunnen.“ Schon bei Beginn des Feldzugs am 14. Juni 1849 hatte der König angeordnet, dass nicht sein oberkommandierender Bruder die kriegsgerichtlichen Urteile zu bestätigen hätte, sondern die jeweiligen Korpskommandeure Hirschfeld und Groeben. An den König gerichtete Gnadengesuche sollte das Staatsministerium beurteilen. Nachdem ein Gnadengesuch der Mutter Dortus in Potsdam abgelehnt worden war, unterzeichnete Hirschfeld am 30. Juli das Todesurteil. Am Tag darauf erschossen preußische Soldaten Dortu auf dem Wiehrefriedhof in Freiburg. Auch in der Folge prangte Hirschfelds Unterschrift unter den zur Abschreckung in Plakatform verbreiteten Urteilen der preußischen Militärjustiz in Baden, darunter dem für Gottfried Kinkel vom 30. September 1849. Eine Stellungnahme Hirschfelds zu seiner Rolle ist nicht überliefert. Sein Biograf und Freund Heinrich von Holleben geht in der Lebensbeschreibung Hirschfelds nur kurz auf die „damalige Operation“ ein, erwähnt den Oberbefehlshaber nicht namentlich, sondern schreibt, Hirschfeld hätte „unter einem höheren Kommando“ gestanden und fährt fort: „Aber die deutsche Uneinigkeit und zwar unter den Fürsten selbst, welche sich bei dieser Gelegenheit offenbarte, erschien Hirschfeld gefährlicher und schädlicher, als jene Aufstände“. Bei dem feierlichen Einzug des Großherzogs und des Prinzen von Preußen in Karlsruhe am 18. August 1849, der den Charakter einer Siegesfeier hatte, war Hirschfeld im Unterschied zu Groeben und anderen Befehlshabern abwesend. Letzte Jahre Nach der Rückkehr im September 1849 übertrug ihm Friedrich Wilhelm IV. zunächst die Geschäfte des Kommandierenden Generals des VIII. Armee-Korps in Koblenz. Ab März 1852 trug Hirschfeld auch den Titel des Kommandierenden Generals. Namens König Friedrich Wilhelms IV. begleitete er 1852 Charles-Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, den Präsidenten der französischen Republik, auf seiner Huldigungsreise von Nancy durch das Elsass nach Straßburg. Hirschfelds 50. Dienstjubiläum am 24. Juli 1854, aus dessen Anlass er den Roten Adlerorden I. Klasse mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern in Brillanten erhielt, wurde in der Rheinprovinz als gesellschaftliches Ereignis begangen. Im Oktober 1856 General der Infanterie geworden, leitete er in der Krise von 1859 ab April und seit Juni auch offiziell in der Stellung des Generalgouverneurs der Rheinprovinz die dortige Mobilmachung. Die Planung des Generalstabschefs Helmut von Moltke für den Krieg mit Frankreich sah vor, aus dem VII., dem VIII. und dem anrückenden IV. Armee-Korps bei Trier die Zweite Moselarmee zu bilden. Mit rund 100.000 Mann sollte sie ein Drittel der preußischen Feldarmee umfassen. Zu ihrem Befehlshaber wurde Hirschfeld bestimmt. Schon im Juli 1859 verhinderte der Vorfrieden von Villafranca den Ausbruch des Krieges. Nach einigen Tagen leichten Unwohlseins verbrachte Moritz von Hirschfeld den Abend des 13. Oktober 1859 „froh und heiter“ im Kreis der Familie, ging zu Bett und starb. Er wurde an seinem langjährigen Wohnort Koblenz auf dem Hauptfriedhof beigesetzt. Privates und Familie Hirschfeld galt als wenig gesprächig, stand nicht gern im Mittelpunkt, wirkte im Dienst etwas unnahbar und ging nur im Freundes- und Familienkreis aus sich heraus. Sein Bruder und er hatten in Spanien Tagebücher geführt, die 1811 in den Besitz des späteren Feldmarschalleutnants Palombini kamen. Als dieser 1843 Hirschfeld als Autor identifizieren konnte, schickte er sie an ihn zurück. Hirschfelds Freund General Heinrich von Holleben veröffentlichte sie 1863. Im Jahr 1825 hatte Moritz von Hirschfeld Ida von Kamptz (1801–1875) geheiratet. Der Ehe entsprossen der oben erwähnte Sohn und zwei Töchter. Ida Isabella heiratete 1856 den Leutnant Friedrich Wilhelm von Holleben (* 13. Oktober 1824), einen Sohn Heinrich von Hollebens, und Wilhelmine Ida 1861 den späteren General Karl Gustav von Sandrart. |
G;|Jean Frédéric Bernard (* 1680 in Velaux, Provence; † 27. Juni 1744 in Amsterdam) war ein französischer Buchhändler, Autor, Übersetzer, Drucker und Verleger. Er wirkte hauptsächlich in den Niederlanden, publizierte jedoch überwiegend in seiner Muttersprache. Der Sohn einer hugenottischen Flüchtlingsfamilie, die weit in das kulturelle Netzwerk jener Epoche verwebt war, wurde in Amsterdam dank seines Geschicks mit Reprintauflagen zu einem der auflagenstärksten Verleger der Niederlande, der mit diesem Ertrag und einer Erbschaft auch als Autor bedeutende Werke der europäischen Aufklärung und Naturwissenschaften finanzierte. Die neuere Forschung geht so weit, dass sie zwei seiner Editionen, Recueil de voyages au nord (1715ff.) und Cérémonies et coûtumes religieuses (1723ff.), eine wesentliche und andauernde Wirkung auf die Wahrnehmung der Bildungseliten des frühen 18. Jahrhunderts zuschreibt. Beide Werke hätten die ethische und religiöse Toleranz gegenüber anderen Kulturen und Ethnien in der europäischen Aufklärung verstärkt.  Jugend eines hugenottischen Flüchtlings Jean Frédéric Bernard wurde 1680 in der Provence als Sohn des Pastors Barthélmy Bernard (1646–1694) geboren. Er floh als Hugenotte im Alter von fünf Jahren mit seiner Familie aus religiösen Gründen aus Frankreich zunächst in die Schweiz, nachdem das Edikt von Nantes durch das Edikt von Fontainebleau aufgehoben worden war. Sein Onkel Jean Bernard (1625–1706), der als Pastor in Manosque gedient hatte, galt als bedeutender Theologe und hatte gewissermaßen die Führung der gesamten Familie Bernard und die Leitung der Flucht zunächst nach Lausanne übernommen. Dort sah man ihn als Führer aller hugenottischen Familien in der dortigen Diaspora an. Daher wählte man Jean Bernard aus, um Spenden für die Hugenotten in Europa zu werben, was ihn schließlich nach Den Haag führte. Dort bat er bei Maria Stuart, der Gattin Wilhelm III., um finanzielle Mittel und eine dauerhafte Zuflucht für die Hugenotten. Durch seine Mutter Catherine Guib war Jean Frédéric Bernard fest im Netz der Hugenottischen Eliten verknüpft. Sein Großvater mütterlicherseits war Jean Frederic Guib, der schottischer Abstammung war und einen medizinischen Abschluss der Universität von Valence aufzuweisen hatte. Guib wirkte schließlich als Provost und Professor für Rhetorik am Collége d’Orange. Darüber hinaus war Jean Frederic Guib mit dem persönlichen Sekretär des Niederländischen Statthalters, des Poeten Constantijn Huygens und dessen Sohn dem Astronom, Mathematiker und Physiker Christiaan Huygens, befreundet. Auch diese Verbindungen sollten seinem Enkel Jean Frédéric die weitere Laufbahn erleichtern. Doch die Netzwerke zahlten sich für die gesamte Familie aus: Barthélmy Bernard bekam schon bald eine Pastorenstelle an der reformierten Kirche in Amsterdam. Dies stellte sich als besondere Leistung heraus, da insgesamt 360 hugenottische Pastoren auf rund ein dutzend freie Pfarrstellen der wallonischen Kirche gekommen waren. Bereits am 29. Mai 1686 erhielt Barthélmy Bernard das Bürgerrecht der Stadt Amsterdam, was im Normalfall mehr als ein Jahr gedauert und ihn beträchtliche finanzielle Mittel gekostet hätte. Doch aufgrund seiner schlechten Gesundheit verstarb Barthélmy Bernard bereits 1694. Dies machte Jean Frédéric Bernard im Alter von 14 Jahren und seine zwei überlebenden Geschwister, Elisabeth und Henri, nachdem ihre Mutter bereits verstorben war, zu Vollwaisen. Um diese kümmerten sich nun seine beiden Onkel Jean Bernard und Henri Guib, der Bruder seiner Mutter. Der gesellschaftliche Hintergrund seiner Familie suggerierte eine universitäre oder geistliche Laufbahn - doch Jean Frédéric Bernard brach mit diesen Traditionen. Anfänge im Buchhandel und Verlagswesen 1704 zog Jean Frédéric dank seiner Schweizer Beziehungen zurück nach Genf – jedoch nicht als Student der Theologie, sondern um sein Glück im Handel zu machen. Bereits in Amsterdam hatte er die Bekanntschaft mit einer Hugenottischen Verleger-Dynastie gemacht, die familiäre Beziehungen zu seinem späteren Freund Pierre Humbert besaß. In Genf fasste er dank dieses Netzwerks Fuß im Maklergeschäft, wobei der Buchhandel ein wichtiger Teil seines Geschäfts blieb, das in beiden Bereichen vom wechselseitigen Vertrauen und dem Aufbau einer gewissen Klientel lebte. Selbst Pierre Bayle gehörte zu seinen Kunden. 1707 kehrte Bernard nach Amsterdam zurück. Als facteur de la société des libraires (also Mitglied der Buchhändlergesellschaft) von Genf firmierte Jean Frédéric Bernard in Amsterdam von 1705 bis 1711. Er trat danach als Autor von Übersetzungen, Herausgeber kritischer Editionen, sowie von verschiedenen historischen und literarischen Werken hervor. Die kurze Ehe mit der ebenfalls hugenottischen Jeanne Chartier, die bereits zwei Monate nach der Heirat im Alter von 26 Jahren 1714 starb, markierte einen doppelten Wendepunkt in Bernards Leben. Denn Jeanne Chartier war äußerst vermögend und im Besitz eines größeren Hauses in der renommierten Keizersgracht, sodass ihm als einzigem Erbe ein bedeutendes Kapital zufloss. Dadurch wurde seine Verlegertätigkeit noch angeregt. Gerade dieses Erbe ermöglichte überhaupt erst die anspruchsvollere Produktion der ersten Auflage von Recueil de voyages au nord : contenant divers mémoires très utiles au commerce & à la navigation, 1715, die seinen Ruhm begründen sollte. Dieses Werk war eine Zusammenstellung von mehreren Arktis-Reisen. Darunter befand sich auch die erste Publikation von Nicole Jérémies Relation du détroit et de la baie de Hudson, eines in Québec geborenen Pelzhändlers, der Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville an die Hudson Bay begleitet hatte. Die Beschreibungen der Region und insbesondere der Inuit waren besonders wertvoll, weil Jérémie im Unterschied zu den Forschungsreisenden 20 Jahre am Ort gelebt hatte. In relativ kleinem Format und preisgünstiger Aufmachung vereinten die Reiseberichte Aufzeichnungen von Händlern, Missionaren und Pelztierjägern, die Bernard übersetzte, editierte und zum Teil auch eigene Abhandlungen beisteuerte. Dabei war es für ihn wichtig, dass der Leser letztlich seine persönliche Interpretation über alles stellte. Dies erklärte auch die überaus große Anzahl von Karten und Illustrationen, was neben seinem Redaktionstalent den langjährigen Erfolg der Reihe bis in die 1730er Jahre ausmachte. Allerdings hatte er selbst kuriose Berichte wie den jener Islandreise (La Relation d´Islande, 1644) des französischen Attaché am Kopenhagener Hof, Isaak de Peyères, der 1663 in Frankreich erstmals veröffentlicht wurde, in die Sammlung mit aufgenommen. Denn de Peyères war selbst niemals in Island gewesen und hatte den Bericht komplett auf sekundärem Material allein um des erzählerischen Effekts willens fehlerhaft aufgebaut, obwohl ihn ihm bekannte Fachleute wie der dänische Archäologe Ole Worm auf die Mängel hingewiesen hatten. In einem wichtigen Punkt jedoch ging Peyères auf die wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse Worms ein: Die Einhorn-Saga aufgrund der auf Island gefundenen Narwalstoßzähne versuchte er zu berichtigen. Selbst die erneute Publikation dieser Widerlegung konnte die Legende in den nächsten 150 Jahren nicht aufhalten. Durchbruch als Verleger 1718 heiratete Bernard erneut eine reiche Braut: Marie Sophie Lacoste († 1736), ebenfalls Hugenottin, entstammte einer Familie von Samt-Manufakteuren aus Montauban. Denn Bernard konnte mit Sicherheit Kapital bei dem nicht risikoarmen Geschäft der Buchproduktion benötigten, die manchem aufstrebenden Verleger, wie z.B. dem konvertierten Jesuiten Henri Du Sauzet (1687–1754), trotz wohlwollender Besprechungen und vermeintlicher Verkaufserfolge, in den Bankrott trieben. Du Sauzet, der bei der Herausgabe der skandalträchtigen Erinnerungen des Jean-François Paul de Gondi, Kardinal von Retz, 1719 mit Bernard zusammengearbeitet hatte, stand stets der Insolvenz nahe. 1747 musste du Sauzet seinen Bankrott erklären, um ein paar Jahre später völlig verarmt zu sterben. Denn damals kam es häufig vor, dass gerade kostbare Bücher von ihren vermögenden Kunden nicht etwa bei Ablieferung bar bezahlt wurden, um stattdessen weitere, teure Bücher im Voraus im Subskriptionsprinzip zu bestellen. Dies nötigte die großen Buchhändler zu einem breiten Angebot, während die weniger vermögenden Verleger oft genötigt waren, ihre unverkauften Bestände in einer Auktion feilzubieten. Mit seinem Freund und Kollegen Humbert teilte Bernard eine liberale und freizügige Perspektive auf religiöse und weltanschauliche Fragen, was beide auch nicht daran hinderte, Werke wie das des großen französischen Liberalen des 17. Jahrhunderts, Gabriel Naudé, Apologie pour tous les grands personnages qui ont esté faussement soupçonnez de magie (1625) neu herauszugeben oder die Sermons des englischen Erzbischofs von Canterbury, John Tillotson, zu veröffentlichen. Die Basis für seinen geschäftlichen Erfolg legte Bernard mit der Massenproduktion von für ihn in der Herstellung günstigen Reprint-Auflagen französischer Erfolgsproduktionen in heutiger Paperback-Art, die er in ganz Europa erfolgreich vertrieb. So gehörten unter anderem Jean de la Fontaine, Anne de la Roche-Guilhen, die Studien François Hédelins über das französische Theater oder François Fénelons Abhandlungen über die Rhetorik oder die Poetik zu seinem Angebot. Mit diesen Gewinnen und den Erträgen aus den Vermögen seiner Frauen finanzierte er die renommierträchtigen, aber auf kurze Sicht wenig ertragreichen Luxusproduktionen. Wie viele andere seines Fachs kümmerte er sich bei den Reprint kaum um Urheberrechte, war der Buchhandel jener Ära doch dank eines allseitigen Überlebenskampfes kaum von Skrupeln geprägt. Die Reprints machten alleine 70 Prozent seiner literarischen Gesamtproduktion aus. In den 1720er Jahren wurde Bernard Mitglied eines Konsortiums von Buchhändlern, die sich Die Gesellschaft der 14 nannten und sich darauf spezialisiert hatten, urheberrechtsverletzende Piraten-Reprint-Ausgaben in Massen auf den europäischen Buchmarkt zu werfen. Dazu gehörten auch Jonathan Swifts Gullivers Reisen in französischer Übersetzung, Werke Voltaires (Histoire de Charles XII), für den Bernard daher eine regelrechte Hassfigur war, und Charles Rollins De la manière d´ètudier les belle lettres. Diese rechtswidrige Grundhaltung hinderte die 14 jedoch nicht daran, selbst ihren eigenen Mitgliedern gegenüber restriktive Maßnahmen aufzuerlegen. So veröffentlichte man 1734 selbst äußert erfolgreich Blaise Pascal Lettres provinciales. Als aber Bernard diese unter seinem eigenen Namen herausgeben wollte, musste er wie jedes andere Mitglied der 14 zuerst eine Lizenz erwerben. Um die gestiegene Verfolgung der Raubdrucke durch die niederländischen Behörden zu umgehen, fälschte Bernard selbst die Original-Werksstempel. Dies trug jedoch auch dazu bei, die Produktion vor der Zensur oder der politischen wie religiösen Strafverfolgung zu schützen. In den Cérémonies et coûtumes religieuses de tous les peuples représésentés par des figures dessinées par Bernard Picart, 1723–1743, entwickelte Bernard in seiner Einleitung ein überraschendes religionstheoretisches Konzept: „Religion ist für ihn primär ein gesellschaftliches Phänomen. In ihrem wesentlichen Kern stimmten alle Religionen überein, lediglich in ihren Ausdrucksformen seien sie unterschiedlich. In den diversen Bräuchen und Formen fänden die je eigenen religiösen Vorstellungen der Menschen ihren Ausdruck; dahinter liege jedoch das im Wesen des Menschen ganz allgemein begründete Bedürfnis nach Zeremonien überhaupt. Ebenfalls anthropologisch konstant sei der Wunsch, bestimmte Zeiten und Aspekte des Menschseins wie Geburt und Tod durch religiöse Rituale zu deuten, aber auch der Versuch durch Gebete Zugang zum Göttlichen zu schaffen.“ Die siebenbändige Folioausgabe über die Zeremonien und kultischen Ausdrucksformen sämtlicher bekannter Religionen war trotz des hohen Preises und des unhandlichen Formats ein Bestseller der Epoche der Aufklärung. Die 1.200 Exemplare der ersten Auflage waren bald verkauft, es erschienen Übersetzungen ins Deutsche, Englische und Niederländische, 1741 sogar eine Konkurrenzausgabe in Frankreich selbst. Die zeitgenössischen Rezensenten besprachen das Werk überaus wohlwollend und in den Beständen der prominenten Sammler jener Zeit ist das Werk weit verbreitet nachgewiesen worden. Besondere Bedeutung erlangte das Werk insbesondere durch die zahlreichen Illustrationen des Kupferstechers Bernard Picart, die beim Publikum so sehr beliebt waren, dass man das Werk als Picart assoziierte. In der neueren Forschung will man bei Bernard und Picart eindeutige Wurzeln des Gallikanismus und Jansenismus entdeckt haben. Außerdem zeigten die Illustrationen gerade Ethnien, die im Tenor der Zeit zuvor meist als „blutrünstige Wilde“ abgebildet wurden, wie z. B. die Indianer Floridas, als fürsorgliche Individuen bei der Trauer um ihre Angehörigen. Somit wäre die religiöse und kulturelle Toleranz in der europäischen Aufklärung der ersten Hälfte des 18. Jahrhunderts verstärkt worden. Dagegen billigte eine monokausale Studie den Illustrationen Picarts zwar eine hohe künstlerische Qualität zu, sah aber andererseits in die vielfältigen Illustrationen eines „neuen“ Juden-Typus, der Ashkenazi, gewissermaßen eine soziale Kritik an deren wachsenden Einfluss in Amsterdam. Andere jüdische Studien sahen diesen Einfluss trotz aller Klischees weitaus differenzierter, zumal die Darstellung Picarts bis heute einen ikonographischen Einfluss auf die jüdische Kultur hätten. Mit den Cérémonies et coûtumes religieuses war Bernard eben nicht mehr allein der intellektuelle Unternehmer, sondern ein expandierender Kapitalist geworden. Das Projekt eines neuen Journals, der Mémoires historiques et critiques nahm er 1722 mit dem angesehenen Journalisten François-Denis Camusat und dem bekannten Historiker und Geographen Antoine Augustin Bruzen de la Martinière ambitioniert in Angriff. Während Camusat die inhaltliche Führung übernommen hatte, sorgte Bruzen für die Zusammenfassungen und Besprechungen. Wie ein älteres Projekt, das Bernard mit du Sauzet Jahre zuvor versucht hatte, waren auch die Mémoires historiques et critiques kein Publikumserfolg. Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Camusat und Bruzen hatte sich jedoch bewährt. Camusat war ebenfalls der leitende Journalist bei dem nächsten Projekt Bernards, der Bibliothèque Françoise, die nach längerer Anlaufzeit schließlich Erfolg haben sollte. In ihrem Wesen verwandte Seelen prangerten in diesem Journal insbesondere die Praxis des damaligen Journalismus an, unliebsame Tendenzen zu unterdrücken und wie z.B. Wetstein vor allen Dingen Artikel konkurrierender Unternehmen bewusst zu ignorieren. Als die Bibliothèque Françoise endlich erfolgreich war, schien Bernard – im Gegensatz zu Camusat, der bis zu seinem Tode 1732 für das Journal schrieb – sein Interesse daran verloren zu haben und verkaufte die Rechte an du Sauzet, der die Reihe bis 1746 fortsetzte. Nach Camusats Tod versammelte Bernard dessen literarischen Nachlass in der lange Zeit singulär dastehenden Histoire critique des journaux, 1734. Nachdem Maria Sibylla Merian in Amsterdam gestorben war, kaufte Bernard ihre Druckplatten auf und ließ ihre Werke 1730 erneut herausgeben. Seine andere geographisch-naturwissenschaftliche Reihe, die Recueil de voyages au nord erlebten in den 1730er Jahren komplett eine zweite Auflage, wobei erwähnenswert ist, dass er selbst nicht unerhebliche Summen in die in den Nordamerikanischen Kolonien Frankreichs, wie z.B. Louisiana, operierenden Handelsgesellschaften und darüber hinaus in die Niederländische Ostindien-Kompanie investierte. Auch andere Hugenotten und Niederländer ermutigte er dazu, und im Unterschied zu manch anderen Investoren hatte er damit Glück. Bernard machte niemals ein Geheimnis aus seiner Verlegertätigkeit, verschwieg aber geradezu seine Verdienste als Autor und hinterließ bewusst kein eigenes Bildnis. Dies mag neben den Bedenken wegen der damaligen Zensur damit zusammengehangen haben, dass er zwar großen Respekt vor dem Wissen seiner Umgebung hatte, der reinen Universitätsgelehrtheit jedoch ablehnend gegenüberstand. Im Gegensatz zu einigen seiner Kollegen enttäuschte er die Erwartungen seiner Subskribenten niemals, indem etwa angekündigte Werke nicht erschienen wären. Dennoch zog er zur Sicherheit stets die Gesellschaft von Kontraktkompanien vor, die ein riskantes Buchprojekt gemeinsam stützen konnten. So nahm er die niederländische Übersetzung der Cérémonies et coûtumes religieuses erst dann in Angriff, als sich ihm fünf weitere Verlagshäuser anschlossen, obwohl er bereits mehrere hundert Subskribenten zu verzeichnen hatte. |
G;|Hermann Anastas Bahr (* 19. Juli 1863 in Linz; † 15. Januar 1934 in München) war ein österreichischer Schriftsteller, Dramatiker sowie Theater- und Literaturkritiker. Er gilt als geistreicher Wortführer bürgerlich-literarischer Strömungen vom Naturalismus, über die Wiener Moderne bis hin zum Expressionismus.  1863–1890 Hermann Bahr kam in der Herrenstraße 12 in Linz als Sohn des Rechtsanwalts, Notars und Landtagsabgeordneten Alois Bahr (1834–1898) und seiner Frau Wilhelmine (Minna, geborene Weidlich, 1836–1902) zur Welt. Er besuchte in Linz die Volksschule und für vier Jahre das Akademische Gymnasium. Von November 1878 bis 1881 absolvierte er das Benediktiner-Gymnasium in Salzburg. Das Gymnasium beendete er als einer der herausragendsten Schüler, weswegen er die Abschlussrede halten durfte. Die Rede zu dem Thema Der Wert der Arbeit soll wegen ihrer sozialistischen Aussage zu einem kleinen Skandal geführt haben. Nach dem Umzug nach Wien studierte Bahr Klassische Philologie, wechselte aber schon nach wenigen Wochen zur Rechtswissenschaft. In dieser Zeit wurde der junge Bahr von seinem Onkel Salomo Robiscek in die berühmte Gesellschaft des Café Scheidl eingeführt und wurde 1881 Kneipschwanz der Wiener akademischen Burschenschaft Albia. Trotz Mensur verweigerte er aus Rücksicht auf seinen Vater eine echte Mitgliedschaft. Er lernte Georg von Schönerer, den Führer der Deutschnationalen, kennen und wurde in der Alldeutschen Bewegung aktiv. Wegen einer deutschnationalen Trauerrede auf Richard Wagner wurde er im März 1883 von der Universität in Wien ausgeschlossen. Nun studierte Bahr jeweils nur wenige Monate in Graz und in Czernowitz weiter. Im März 1884 schrieb er sich an der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin ein, wo er Nationalökonomie bei Adolf Wagner und Gustav von Schmoller hörte. Gleichzeitig besuchte er auch Vorlesungen in Philosophie, Geschichte, Literatur und Kunstgeschichte. Ohne Abschluss verließ Bahr 1887 Berlin, um zunächst ein Freiwilligenjahr beim 84. Linzer Regiment in Wien abzuleisten. Danach finanzierte sein Vater ihm einen einjährigen Aufenthalt in Paris sowie zum Abschluss eine Reise nach Südfrankreich, Spanien und Marokko. Durch seinen Aufenthalt in Paris wurde das Interesse Bahrs an Literatur und dem Theater verstärkt. War er schon seit 1882 publizistisch aufgetreten, intensivierte sich das gegen Ende des Jahrzehnts zunehmend. Seine erste Sammlung mit Zeitungsarbeiten erschien als Zur Kritik der Moderne im Herbst 1889 (auf 1890 vordatiert). Er schrieb mit der Guten Schule einen Roman in Nachfolge von Joris-Karl Huysmans’ Gegen den Strich, Literatur- und Kunstkritiken sowie Essays, aber auch Erzählungen und Theaterstücke. 1889–1900 Im nächsten Jahrzehnt wurde Bahr zunehmend zum Prophet der Moderne. Arbeitete er zunächst für verschiedene Verlage und Zeitschriften, so bestimmte einerseits seine 1890 erfolgte Berufung als Mitarbeiter der Zeitschrift Freie Bühne nach Berlin, andererseits auch die Suche nach einer Festanstellung bzw. Versuche, eigene Zeitungsprojekte auf den Weg zu bringen, seinen weiteren Werdegang. Zum wichtigsten Verlag für seine Bücher wurde in dieser Zeit der 1886 gegründete S. Fischer Verlag in Berlin. Durch die Bücher Bahrs sowie durch ihn vermittelte Titel wurde S. Fischer zu einem der wichtigsten Verlage für die moderne Literatur. Als es ihm nicht gelang, Nachfolger von Otto Brahm bei der Freien Bühne zu werden, verließ er mit Arno Holz, Detlev von Liliencron und anderen Ende Juli 1890 die Redaktion. Im folgenden Jahr reiste Bahr nach St. Petersburg, wo er Eleonora Duse kennenlernte und sie mit Feuilletons in Deutschland und Österreich-Ungarn bekannt machte. Wieder in Wien schloss er Bekanntschaft mit Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Arthur Schnitzler, Peter Altenberg und anderen Schriftstellern. Die neuen literarischen Tendenzen, mit denen er so in Kontakt kam, machte Bahr unter dem Namen einer Bewegung Jung-Wiens publizistisch bekannt, wobei Fischer als Verleger fungierte und Bahr selbst zum Sprachrohr dieser Strömung wurde. Ein Buch mit gesammelten Kritiken aus dieser Zeit trägt den programmatischen Titel Die Überwindung des Naturalismus (1891). In Wien arbeitete Hermann Bahr ab 1892 als Kulturredakteur und Theaterkritiker in der Nachfolge von Ludwig Ganghofer für die Deutsche Zeitung und stieg vom Redakteur zum Mitherausgeber auf. Eine in dieser Zeit geführte Interviewreihe zum Antisemitismus, die er nach dem Vorbild der Enquête sur l'évolution littéraire von Jules Huret gestaltete – und die auch als Buch erschien –, ist möglicherweise das erste deutschsprachige Interviewbuch. Nachdem Bahr 1894 bei der Deutschen Zeitung gekündigt hatte, gründete er mit Heinrich Kanner und Isidor Singer die Wochenschrift Die Zeit, deren Kulturteil er betreute und in der mehrere wegweisende Essays Bahrs erschienen. 1899 kündigte er auch hier und arbeitete in der Folge für den Steyrermühl-Konzern, für dessen Blätter Oesterreichische Volks-Zeitung und Neues Wiener Tagblatt er Theaterkritiken schrieb. Außer als Theaterkritiker trat Bahr in dieser Zeit zunehmend auch als Kritiker der bildenden Kunst hervor. Für die neugegründete Secession wurde er Berater und schrieb Programmatisches für ihre Zeitschrift Ver Sacrum. Hermann Bahr heiratete 1895 die jüdische Schauspielerin Rosa Jokl (1871–1940), wenngleich sie, bedingt durch die Engagements seiner Frau, oft längere Zeit getrennt lebten. Fünf Jahre nach Schließung der Ehe trennte sich das Paar, die Scheidung erfolgte allerdings erst 1909, und Bahr bezahlte seiner Ex-Frau bis an sein Lebensende Unterhalt. 1900–1909 1899/1900 ließ sich Bahr von dem Architekten Joseph Maria Olbrich das Haus Bahr in Ober Sankt Veit, einem dem Wienerwald sehr nahe gelegenen Stadtteil des 13. Wiener Gemeindebezirks, in der Veitlissengasse 7 bzw. Winzerstraße 22 errichten. (Karl Kraus, für den Bahr schon zuvor ein „rotes Tuch“ gewesen war – nach Shakespeare und Goethe wird Bahr am dritthäufigsten in der Fackel erwähnt –, verlor einen Zivilrechtsprozess wegen Beleidigung, weil er behauptet hatte, dass Bahr vom Direktor des Volkstheaters Emmerich von Bukovics mit dem Grundstück im Gegenzug für positive Berichterstattung bestochen wurde. Kraus dürfte jedoch recht gehabt haben.) Zur Innenausstattung seiner Villa gehörte unter anderem auch Gustav Klimts Nuda Veritas. Bahr nutzte seine publizistische Kraft, indem er sich 1901 und 1902 mit seiner Rede für Klimt und mit Gegen Klimt verstärkt für den Künstler einsetzte. Neben seiner Tätigkeit als Theaterredakteur (die größeren Kritiken versammelte er in Buchausgaben) wurde Bahr als Lustspieldichter zunehmend erfolgreich. Von seinen insgesamt mehr als 40 Stücken sind jedoch nur Der Meister und Das Konzert (1909) mehrfach verfilmte, bis heute gespielte Stücke. Einige Bemühungen Bahrs scheiterten, einerseits die Gründung eines eigenen Theaters, andererseits musste er auf eine Stelle als Oberregisseur in München trotz unterschriebenem Vertrag verzichten. Dessen ungeachtet zeigte sich seine Bedeutung auch darin, dass ihn Max Reinhardt an das Deutsche Theater in Berlin berief, wo er 1906 bis 1907 vier Aufenthalte bestritt. Das Bühnenbild einer Ibsen-Inszenierung stammte von Edvard Munch. Bahr war auch ein früher Ideengeber für die Salzburger Festspiele. Während seine literarische Produktion in den Neunzigerjahren der Dekadenz und der Ende des Jahrhunderts-Dichtung zuzuordnen ist, begann Bahr 1908 mit Die Rahl eine Reihe ‚Österreichischer Romane‘, die einen zeithistorischen Wert behaupten, da sie die Jahre des Untergangs des Habsburgerreichs umfassen. Österreich ist, neben dem Katholizismus, als das eigentliche Thema seiner zweiten Lebenshälfte zu bezeichnen. Das äußerte sich u. a. in seinen kritischen Schriften wie Wien (1907), Austriaca (1911) und der Dalmatinischen Reise (1909). Als Kritiker und Journalist – nach der Steyrermühl schrieb Bahr 1907–1932 für die Neue Freie Presse Feuilletons, aber auch für bedeutende Blätter in Deutschland (Berliner Tageblatt, Frankfurter Zeitung, Vossische Zeitung, Berliner Börsen-Courier) – gelang es ihm weiterhin, ein gutes Auge für aktuelle kulturelle Tendenzen zu haben. Inszenierte er sich schon in den 1890ern als Kautschukmann und Schlangenmensch des Geistes, so war er auch in den folgenden Jahrzehnten stets auf der Suche nach Neuentdeckungen und neuen Anregungen. Er begleitete so den Jugendstil ebenso wie den literarischen Impressionismus und initiierte mit einer Artikelserie die Entdeckung der Provinz (1899–1900), die sich mit seiner Hinwendung zu Österreich deckte. Gesundheitlich begann das Jahrzehnt für Bahr mit zwei schweren Erkrankungen, die ihn zum Jahreswechsel 1902/03 und zum Jahreswechsel 1903/1904 an den Rand des Todes führten. Im Rückblick machte er daran den Beginn seiner letzten ‚Wandlung‘ zum Glauben fest. Ein ebenso eingreifender Einschnitt ist der Beginn einer Beziehung mit Anna von Mildenburg, einer der erfolgreichsten Wagner-Interpretinnen ihrer Zeit und ehemalige Geliebte Gustav Mahlers, im Herbst 1904. Im August 1909 heirateten die beiden, nachdem Bahr sich dafür von Rosa Jokl hatte scheiden lassen. Sie blieb bis zu seinem Tod seine Gefährtin und war auch die erste Bearbeiterin seines Nachlasses. 1910–1934 Spätestens mit seinem fünfzigsten Geburtstag im Juli 1913 war Bahr ein Fixpunkt in der deutschsprachigen Kulturszene. Zugleich war damit sein Höhepunkt auch überschritten. Mit Wien hatte er schon 1907 in einem Büchlein abgerechnet und 1912 übersiedelte er mit Anna Bahr-Mildenburg in das Schloss Arenberg in Salzburg. Er konvertierte zum katholischen Glauben und besuchte nunmehr täglich die Messe. Von seinen Freunden wurde der Wandel ebenso ungläubig beobachtet wie von katholischer Seite, die beide meinten, darin eine neue Mode Bahrs zu erkennen, die er ebenso ablegen würde wie viele andere davor. Doch Bahr blieb katholisch bis zu seinem Lebensende. So wurde er auch katholischer Publizist, der vor allem für Das Neue Reich und später für die Schönere Zukunft von Joseph Eberle schrieb. Außer in, in verschiedenen Druckmedien veröffentlichten, Feuilletons, die wie gewöhnlich in Buchausgaben gesammelt wurden, entfaltete Bahr auch eine zunehmend intensive (und bislang wenig erforschte) Vortragstätigkeit. Im Ersten Weltkrieg, von dessen Teilnahme er aufgrund seines Alters ausgenommen war, blieb er lange von der herrschenden Kriegsbegeisterung angesteckt, wovon besonders sein Buch Kriegssegen (1915) zeugt. Aber auch in seiner Nachkriegspublizistik neigte er nicht zum Pazifismus, sondern verteidigte den Nutzen des Krieges. Die Kriegspropaganda zeigt erstmals deutlich, dass aus dem Mann von Übermorgen ein Mann von Gestern wurde. Ein letztes Mal erwies sich Bahr als bedeutsamer Theoretiker der Gegenwart, als er in Expressionismus (1916) versuchte, der neuesten Kunstströmung gerecht zu werden. Journalistisch bildeten sich zunehmend zwei Kommunikationskanäle heraus. Einerseits die ab Herbst 1916 bis Ende 1931 im Neuen Wiener Journal publizierte Kolumne Tagebuch (erste Versuche dazu gab es bereits im vorangehenden Jahrzehnt) mit aktuellen Buchbesprechungen und politischen Kommentaren, andererseits Aufsätze zu den für ihn zentralen Künstlern wie Dostojewskij, Blaise Pascal, Gustav Mahler, Walt Whitman aber auch Marcel Proust und anderen. Mit großem Einsatz bemühte er sich um die Vorgeschichte Jung-Wiens, indem er seine Vorstellung einer österreichischen Literaturgeschichte skizzierte. Neben Franz Grillparzer leistete er besonders für die (Wieder-)Entdeckung Adalbert Stifters einen nicht geringen Beitrag. In der Öffentlichkeit war er noch einmal stark präsent, als er von September 1918 bis ins Frühjahr 1919 als erster Dramaturg am Wiener Burgtheater wirkte. 1922 übersiedelte Bahr nach München, wo seine Frau 1920 eine Professur angenommen hatte und er bis zu seinem Tode lebte. 1927 wurde er in die Sektion für Dichtkunst an der Preußischen Akademie der Künste berufen. Zunehmend von Krankheiten, später Demenz geplagt, brach der Kontakt mit vielen seiner Weggefährten in dieser Zeit ab. Am 15. Jänner 1934 starb er. Ehrungen Ehrengrab Sein Ehrengrab befindet sich auf dem Salzburger Kommunalfriedhof. Straßen Im Jahr seines Todes wurde in Wien-Floridsdorf (21. Bezirk) die vormals nach dem Sozialdemokraten Anton Schlinger benannte Schlingerstraße in Hermann-Bahr-Straße nach ihm umbenannt. Die Umbenennung wird als Bestandteil der Eliminierung von Straßennamen des Roten Wiens im Austrofaschismus angesehen. In Lambach, Vöcklabruck, Traun, St. Pölten und Bad Tölz gibt es ebenfalls Hermann-Bahr-Straßen resp. Wege und Gassen. Salzburg verfügt über eine Hermann-Bahr-Promenade. Brunnen In Linz gibt es in der Robert Bernardis-Straße einen Brunnen, der seinen Namen trägt. Bedeutung Hermann Bahr war, insbesondere durch seine kritischen Schriften, ein bedeutender Literatur- und Kulturtheoretiker der Jahrhundertwende im deutschsprachigen Raum und wesentlich an der Definition neuer Stilrichtungen beteiligt. Er verfasste im Laufe seines Lebens über vierzig Theaterstücke, zirka zehn Romane, vierzig Bände kritische Schriften sowie eine Autobiographie. 1919 fasst er zentrale ‚Entdeckungen‘ seiner publizistischen Tätigkeit zusammen: Bahr war mit vielen bedeutenden Personen seiner Zeit in persönlichem Umgang: In Wien mit Schnitzler, Altenberg, Hofmannsthal, Mahler, Klimt, Otto Wagner, Max Burckhard, Bertha Zuckerkandl, Josef Kainz, Richard Strauss, Stefan Zweig, Egon Friedell, Koloman Moser, Theodor Herzl, Viktor Adler, Josef Redlich u. a. In Deutschland mit Arno Holz, Johannes Schlaf, Oscar A. H. Schmitz, Otto Julius Bierbaum, Frank Wedekind, Wolfgang Heine, Gerhart Hauptmann, Samuel Fischer, Max Reinhardt, Otto Brahm, Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann. International unter anderem mit Ibsen, Émile Zola, Gabriele D'Annunzio, Eleonora Duse, George Bernard Shaw und Ethel Smyth. Die rege Korrespondenz Bahrs ist vor allem aufgrund von (nunmehr obsoleten) Streitigkeiten im Nachlass nur teilweise veröffentlicht. Eine Liste der im Nachlass aufbewahrten Korrespondenz findet sich auf der Website des Theatermuseums (PDF; 154 kB), ein Verzeichnis der gedruckten Briefe auf der Website der Universität Wien. Ein wichtiger Grund für die häufig in der Literatur anzutreffende (und nur teilweise zutreffende) negative Konnotation von Bahr liegt in den Angriffen in der Zeitschrift Die Fackel von Karl Kraus, der von ihm abschätzig als dem Herrn aus Linz sprach. Oft wurde das Urteil Kraus’ unhinterfragt übernommen, gerade weil Nachlassstreitigkeiten die Publikation Bahrs in den fünfzig Jahren nach seinem Tod fast zum Erliegen brachten. War Hermann Bahr zu Lebzeiten besonders als Bühnendichter und Feuilletonist bekannt, und hielt sich nach seinem Ableben seine Bedeutung am Theater am längsten, so intensivierte sich zuletzt die Auseinandersetzung mit ihm in den 1990er Jahren parallel zu der unter Moritz Csáky in fünf Bänden herausgegebenen Sammlung Tagebücher, Skizzenbücher, Notizhefte. Bahrs Rolle als Vermittler der Moderne und Vermittler zwischen den Kulturen rückte in den Vordergrund. Von 2009 und bis 2012 lief an der Universität Wien unter der Leitung von Claus Pias ein vom FWF finanziertes Projekt, das die wichtigsten kritischen Schriften in Leseausgaben wieder auflegte und ein Verzeichnis der Texte Bahrs sowie der Erstdrucke erstellte. Eines seiner bekanntesten Zitate aus dem zum Schlagwort gewordenen Text Die Überwindung des Naturalismus lautet: „Die Herrschaft des Naturalismus ist vorüber, seine Rolle ist ausgespielt, sein Zauber ist gebrochen.“ Aber auch die Texte Die Moderne, Der Symbolismus und Loris sind besonders für die Literaturtheorie des Symbolismus von maßgeblicher Bedeutung. Bahr war stets an der Zukunft der Literatur interessiert. In seinem Selbstbildnis schrieb er: „Ein [...] intellektueller „Herr von Adabei“ bin ich gewesen: da liegen die Tugenden meines Geistes, da seine Laster. [...] Ich habe fast jede geistige Mode dieser Zeit mitgemacht, aber vorher, nämlich als sie noch nicht Mode war. Wenn sie dann Mode wurde, nicht mehr. [...] ich konnte mit Goethe sagen: Wenn die Leute glauben, ich wäre noch in Weimar, dann bin ich schon in Erfurt!“ |
G;|Paul Hausser, auch "Papa Hausser", (* 7. Oktober 1880 in Brandenburg an der Havel; † 21. Dezember 1972 in Ludwigsburg) war Generalleutnant der Reichswehr und später SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer und Generaloberst der Waffen-SS. Damit war Hausser neben Sepp Dietrich der ranghöchste Offizier in der Waffen-SS. Ihm unterstehende Einheiten waren verantwortlich für Kriegsverbrechen, insbesondere an der sowjetischen und italienischen Zivilbevölkerung, für die er nie angeklagt wurde. Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg entfaltete Hausser eine vielfältige Lobbyarbeit für die Veteranen der Waffen-SS.  Herkunft und militärische Laufbahn Hausser war der Sohn des preußischen Majors Kurt Hausser und dessen Ehefrau Anna Hausser (geb. Otto). 1892 kam er mit zwölf Jahren an die Preußische Kadettenanstalt Köslin, dann Preußische Hauptkadettenanstalt Lichterfelde und wurde 1899 in die Armee mit Eintritt in das 7. Westpreußische Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 155 übernommen. Im März desselben Jahres wurde er zum Leutnant und nach Verwendungen als Bataillons- und Regimentsadjutant und dem Besuch der Kriegsakademie im August 1909 zum Oberleutnant befördert. Nach einer Kommandierung zur Kaiserlichen Marine wurde er 1912 in den Großen Generalstab versetzt. Am 9. November 1912 heiratete er Elisabeth Gerard (* 18. Juli 1891 in Berlin; † 16. Oktober 1979 in München). Seine Beförderung zum Hauptmann erfolgte am 22. März 1913. Im Ersten Weltkrieg wurde Hausser wechselnd in Front- und Generalstabsverwendungen eingesetzt und mehrfach ausgezeichnet. Bei Kriegsende war er Major i. G. Nach dem Waffenstillstand beteiligte er sich an dem gegen polnische Gebietsbestrebungen eingesetzten „Grenzschutz Ost“. Mit Unterzeichnung des Versailler Vertrags mussten dessen Verbände aufgelöst werden. Hausser wurde daraufhin 1920 in die Reichswehr als Berufsoffizier übernommen, wo er anfänglich als Erster Generalstabsoffizier (Ia) bei der Reichswehr-Brigade 5, seit 1922 im Stab des Wehrkreiskommandos II eingesetzt wurde. 1923 wurde er als Oberstleutnant Kommandeur des III. Bataillons im 4. (Preußischen) Infanterie-Regiment und war anschließend ab 1925 Chef des Stabes der 2. Division in Stettin. Im Juli 1927 wurde er Kommandeur des 10. (Sächsischen) Infanterie-Regiments und in dieser Stellung im November des gleichen Jahres zum Oberst befördert. 1930 wurde er als Infanterieführer IV nach Magdeburg versetzt, 1931 dann zum Generalmajor ernannt. 1932 schied Hausser im Alter von 51 Jahren altersbedingt mit dem Charakter eines Generalleutnants aus der Reichswehr aus. Nach seiner Entlassung aus der Reichswehr schloss sich Hausser Anfang 1933 dem antidemokratischen, paramilitärischen Stahlhelm an, in dem er die Position des Landesführers „Berlin-Brandenburg“ innehatte. Nationalsozialismus Vorkriegszeit Anfang März 1933 wurde der Stahlhelm von der Sturmabteilung übernommen und eingegliedert. In der neuen SA-Reserve II, die aus dem ehemaligen Stahlhelm gebildet wurde, hatte er nun den Rang und die Dienststellung eines Standartenführers. Nach einer Veranstaltung der Reiter-SA in Braunschweig trat er im November 1934 der Allgemeinen SS bei. Ab Ende 1934 war Hausser Kommandeur einer SS-Junkerschule in Braunschweig und Inspekteur der SS-Junkerschulen Braunschweig und Tölz, ab 1936 dann auch Chef des Amtes I (Führungsamt) im SS-Hauptamt und Inspekteur der SS-Verfügungstruppe. Dort übernahm er die militärische Ausbildung aller bewaffneten SS-Einheiten (mit Ausnahme der SS-Totenkopfverbände), namentlich den SS-Standarten „Deutschland“, „Germania“ und „Der Führer“ als motorisierte Verbände. Zwischen SS-Verfügungstruppe und Totenkopfverbänden gab es einen ständigen Personalaustausch. In der SS-Hierarchie stieg er rasch auf. 1935 wurde er SS-Oberführer, im Mai 1936 SS-Brigadeführer und im Juni 1939 SS-Gruppenführer. Als Ausbildungschef der SS-Verfügungstruppe führte Hausser für deren Soldaten Tarnuniformen ein. Nach Ablauf der vierjährigen Aufnahmesperre für Neuaspiranten („Märzgefallene“) nahm ihn die NSDAP im Mai 1937 auf. Seinen Mitgliedsantrag hatte er spätestens 1935 gestellt. Da die SS eine politische Gliederung der NSDAP war, bekundete er als Leiter der SS-Führerschule Braunschweig, dass er eine „Parteimitgliedschaft für notwendig“ erachte. An der NSDAP hatte ihn schon vor 1933 – so er selbst im Rückblick 1951 – „angezogen“, dass sie die Revision von Versailles beabsichtigte, die Linke bekämpfte und für eine „Volksgemeinschaft“ eintrat. Damit sah er sich in einer Kontinuität eines „erheblichen Teils des Offizierskorps“ der Reichswehr mit dem Nationalsozialismus. Laut Mark Gingerich soll Hausser „in keiner Weise in der nationalsozialistischen Ideologie als solcher befangen“ gewesen sein und trat deshalb später aus beruflichen Gründen der NSDAP bei. Zweiter Weltkrieg Hausser nahm im Stab der Panzer-Division Kempf (auch Panzerverband „Ostpreußen“ genannt), der unter anderem das SS-Regiment „Deutschland“ unterstellt war, am Polenfeldzug teil. Im Oktober 1939 stellte er den ersten selbständigen SS-Kampfverband auf: die „SS-Verfügungsdivision“, die spätere Division „Das Reich“. Zugleich erhielt damit Hausser das Recht, den militärischen Rang eines Generalleutnants zu tragen. Er und Theodor Eicke, der erste Kommandeur der SS-Division Totenkopf und zuvor Inspekteur der Konzentrationslager und der SS-Totenkopfverbände, waren die ersten SS-Führer, die Titel und Schulterstücke eines Generals der Wehrmacht trugen. Die Verfügungsdivision führte er im Westfeldzug 1940, im Balkanfeldzug 1941 und beim Angriff auf die Sowjetunion. Am 1. Oktober 1941 wurde Hausser zum SS-Obergruppenführer befördert. Nach einer im Oktober 1941 beim Vormarsch auf Moskau erlittenen schweren Verwundung und einer Genesungspause wurde Hausser im Juni 1942 mit der Aufstellung des SS-Panzerkorps (später II. SS-Panzerkorps) beauftragt, das zunächst im Westen blieb. Im November 1942 erhielt er den Befehl über die beim Unternehmen Lila, dem versuchten Handstreich gegen die in Toulon vor Anker liegende Vichy-Flotte, eingesetzten Truppen. Mit dem SS-Panzerkorps und den drei unterstellten SS-Panzergrenadier-Divisionen wurde Hausser nach der schweren Niederlage von Stalingrad Anfang 1943 zur Heeresgruppe Süd an die Ostfront verlegt, um dort zu einer Stabilisierung der kritischen Lage beizutragen. Während der Kämpfe in und um Charkow ignorierte er den Befehl Hitlers, Charkow bis auf den letzten Mann zu halten, und ordnete stattdessen den Rückzug aus der Stadt an, um seine Truppen vor der drohenden Einkesselung durch die Rote Armee zu bewahren. Hitler, der in der Regel in solchen Fällen mit unterschiedlichen Sanktionen reagierte, nahm Haussers Ungehorsam hin. So hatte Hitler Hausser drei Wochen vorher mit dem Goldenen Parteiabzeichen der NSDAP ausgezeichnet und fürchtete einen Prestigeverlust, wenn er einen Offizier der Waffen-SS bestrafen würde. Stattdessen enthob er Haussers unmittelbaren Vorgesetzten, Hubert Lanz, des Kommandos, wie dieser auch bei späteren Ordensverleihungen übergangen wurde. Als Strafe wegen Charkow wurde aber ein Vorschlag, „Hausser mit dem Eichenlaub zum Ritterkreuz auszuzeichnen, bis Juli 1943 nicht ausgeführt“. Vier Wochen später wurde die Stadt von deutschen Truppen unter der Leitung Generalfeldmarschalls von Manstein erneut eingenommen, woran das SS-Panzerkorps unter Hausser maßgeblich beteiligt war. Seine SS-Einheiten verübten dabei sowohl gegen Soldaten der Roten Armee wie gegen die sowjetische Zivilbevölkerung zahlreiche Kriegsverbrechen und schwere Übergriffe. Nach der Teilnahme am Unternehmen Zitadelle wurde Haussers Korps im Sommer 1943 – die Alliierten waren inzwischen in Sizilien gelandet – mit der SS-Division „Leibstandarte“ nach Oberitalien verlegt. Hausser hatte den Auftrag, bei Eintreten des „Falls Achse“ in Norditalien die italienischen Streitkräfte zu entwaffnen, deren Angehörige als italienische Militärinternierte zur Zwangsarbeit ins Reich zu deportieren waren, sowie „die Säuberung des Ostraumes“. In der Umsetzung bedeutete das – bis heute unzureichend untersuchte – Verbrechen an der italienischen Zivilbevölkerung im Rahmen der Bekämpfung des italienischen Widerstands gegen die Besetzung. Gesichert ist, dass Einheiten unter Jochen Peiper am 19. September 1943 die piemontesischen Ortschaften Boves und Castellar niederbrannten und dabei Massaker unter den Einwohnern begingen. Hausser hatte zum Zeitpunkt der Massaker das verantwortliche Generalkommando des II. SS-Panzerkorps inne; in einer Meldung des Panzerkorps an die Heeresgruppe B hieß es: „Die Versorgungsbasen für Banditen Boves und Castellar wurden abgebrannt.“ Eine erklärende Reaktion auf das Massaker hat es von Hausser weder zum damaligen Zeitpunkt noch nach dem Ende des Nationalsozialismus je gegeben. Er hat vielmehr stets geleugnet, dass es diese wie andere Verbrechen seiner SS-Angehörigen überhaupt gegeben habe. In Erwartung der alliierten Invasion im Westen wurde er mit seinem Korps im Dezember 1943 nach Frankreich verlegt. Nach dem Eintreten einer schweren Krise bei der Heeresgruppe Nordukraine (→ Kesselschlacht von Kamenez-Podolski) wurde das Korps dann jedoch wieder an der Ostfront eingesetzt. Erst nach der Landung der Alliierten in der Normandie (→ Operation Neptune) wurde das Korps Ende Juni 1944 erneut in den Westen verlegt. Am 29. Juni 1944 übernahm Hausser nach dem Tod seines Vorgängers Friedrich Dollmann die 7. Armee an der Invasionsfront und wurde Anfang August 1944 zum SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer und Generaloberst der Waffen-SS befördert. Neben ihm hatte allein der wegen seiner Normüberschreitungen berüchtigte Josef „Sepp“ Dietrich diesen Rang. Nachdem der Versuch einer Gegenoffensive bei Mortain (→ Unternehmen Lüttich) gescheitert war, was von Hitler als weiterer Verratsfall nach dem Attentat vom 20. Juli 1944 gedeutet wurde, setzte er den verantwortlichen Oberbefehlshaber West und Heeresgruppe B, Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge, ab. Zu Recht verdächtigte er ihn, mit den Putschisten im Bunde zu sein. Hausser schätzte er als vertrauenswürdig ein, weshalb er ihn bis zum Eintreffen des Nachfolgers Walter Model an Kluges Stelle setzte. Hausser wurde beim Ausbruch aus dem Kessel von Falaise am 21. August erneut schwer verwundet, was eine längere Genesungspause notwendig machte. Hitler zeichnete ihn am 26. August mit dem Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Schwertern aus, nachdem Hausser bis dahin bereits eine größere Zahl hoher Orden erhalten hatte. Im Januar 1945 erhielt Hausser den Befehl über die Heeresgruppe Oberrhein, bereits nach wenigen Tagen dann den der Heeresgruppe G im südlichen Teil der Westfront. Im Februar erließ er einen Durchhaltebefehl in dieser Schlussphase des Kriegs, dieser drohte zu diesem Zeitpunkt des absehbaren Zusammenbruchs des nationalsozialistischen Regimes die sofortige Erschießung eigener versprengter Soldaten an. Das außerordentliche Vertrauen, das Hitler stets in Hausser gesetzt hatte, erlitt kurz vor Kriegsende angesichts unterschiedlicher Einschätzungen militärstrategischer Details eine deutliche Trübung. Anfang April 1945 enthob Hitler Hausser seines Postens als Oberbefehlshaber der Heeresgruppe G. Hausser, der bis zum Ende des Krieges unbeschäftigt blieb, flüchtete nach Österreich. Nachkriegszeit Im Mai 1945 stellte er sich in Zell am See den US-Truppen und durchlief anschließend verschiedene Lager, so das Internierungslager Dachau, um schließlich als SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer und Generaloberst der Waffen-SS nach dem Grundsatz des „Automatischen Arrests“ in ein Internierungslager für NS-Belastete überstellt zu werden. 1949 wurde er aus der Haft entlassen. Anklagen wurden trotz seines hohen Rangs in der SS nicht erhoben. Die Annahme liegt nahe, dass dies auf seine zeitweilige Tätigkeit im Lager Oberursel für die Operational History (German) Section der Historical Division zurückzuführen ist, in der unter der Leitung des Heeresgeneralstabschefs Franz Halder hohe deutsche Militärs für den US-amerikanischen Geheimdienst Studien zu einer Geschichte der deutschen Operationen im Zweiten Weltkrieg erarbeiteten. Dabei ging es im Zeichen der Blockkonfrontation darum, die deutschen Ostfronterfahrungen für operative Problemstellungen in einem möglichen Krieg gegen die Sowjetunion nutzbar zu machen. In den Nürnberger Prozessen war Hausser 1946 „der wichtigste Entlastungszeuge für die Waffen-SS“ (Mitcham). Er bemühte sich mit hohem Aufwand, die Waffen-SS als eine unpolitische Truppe hinzustellen, wie die Wehrmacht eine gewesen sei. Er leugnete die Bedeutung des Führererlasses vom 17. August 1938, mit dem Allgemeine SS, Verfügungstruppe und Totenkopfverbände gegeneinander und gegen Polizei und Wehrmacht abgegrenzt wurden. Demnach waren die Verfügungstruppe wie auch die Totenkopfverbände „weder ein Teil der Wehrmacht noch der Polizei“, sondern „Gliederungen der NSDAP“ zu Hitlers „ausschließlicher Verfügung“ und den weltanschaulich-politischen Grundsätzen der SS unterworfen. Nach Hausser jedoch habe „dem Erlass … eine grundlegende Bedeutung nicht beigemessen werden“ können. Tatsächlich hatte er selbst auf einer SS-Führertagung in Berlin im Januar 1939 mit Blick auf den Erlass offen bekundet: „Die VT ist und bleibt ein Teil der Schutzstaffel. Sie verwirklicht die Einheit zwischen den bewährten politischen Soldaten und dem Waffenträger innerhalb der Partei“. Obwohl er aufgrund seiner Dienststellung genau wissen musste, dass es eine sehr hohe Zahl von Kommandierungen aus den Totenkopfverbänden in die Waffen-SS und umgekehrt gab, ja, dass Wachmannschaften der KZ, so auch der Vernichtungslager, in mehreren Wellen systematisch in die Waffen-SS überführt worden waren, behauptete er, die beiden Teilverbände der SS hätten nichts miteinander zu tun gehabt. Nach Angaben des britischen Geheimdienstes nahm er Kontakt zur 1949 gegründeten „Bruderschaft“ auf, einer Vereinigung von Altnazis rund um den Exgauleiter Karl Kaufmann, die die junge Bundesrepublik Deutschland unterwandern wollte. Ab 1951 war Hausser zusammen mit Otto Kumm und Herbert Otto Gille einer der Organisatoren der Hilfsgemeinschaft auf Gegenseitigkeit der Soldaten der ehemaligen Waffen-SS (HIAG). Ziel dieser Organisation, die vom Verfassungsschutz als nationalsozialistisch beeinflusst eingeschätzt und observiert wurde, war es, die rechtlich und politisch bedeutsame Definition der Waffen-SS als „verbrecherische Organisation“ durch den Internationalen Militärgerichtshof in Nürnberg rückgängig zu machen und sie als eine „normale militärische Formation“ darzustellen. Zu diesem Zweck verfasste Hausser eine autobiografisch orientierte Rechtfertigungsschrift, die unter unterschiedlichen Titeln und mit hoher Auflage in rechtsextremen Verlagen erschien. Haussers Publikation „Waffen-SS im Einsatz“ wurde 1960 von der Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Schriften indiziert. Seit der Entstehung der HIAG betrieb Hausser eine vielfältige Lobbyarbeit zugunsten der Veteranen der Waffen-SS. So rechtfertigte er die Bildung der HIAG in einer öffentlichen Erklärung, trat als Redner auf Soldatentreffen auf und unterhielt Kontakte mit Politikern, beispielsweise im Januar 1957 mit Bundestagspräsident Eugen Gerstenmaier. 1958 arbeitete er eine Denkschrift aus, um eine Versorgung der ehemaligen Soldaten der Waffen-SS nach Art. 131 GG (sog. 131er) zu erreichen, die Wehrmachtssoldaten bereits 1951 gewährt worden war. Dem Historiker Hermann Weiß zufolge war es Haussers „teilweise verharmlosender Charakterisierung der Waffen-SS als einem zwar elitären, aber soldatisch der Wehrmacht gleichzustellenden ‚vierten Wehrmachtsteil‘ mit zuzuschreiben“, dass der Deutsche Bundestag dann 1961 eine entsprechende Regelung beschloss. Innerhalb der HIAG setzte sich Hausser dafür ein, keine eigenständige zentrale Organisation zu bilden, sondern sich gemeinsam mit früheren Wehrmachtssoldaten im Verband deutscher Soldaten (VdS) zu organisieren, in dessen Präsidium er Mitglied war. Hintergrund war die Befürchtung, eine eigenständige Organisation könne als Nachfolgeorganisation der Waffen-SS verboten werden, und die seitens der Veteranen der Waffen-SS vertretene Behauptung, sie seien „Soldaten wie andere auch“ gewesen. Mit dieser Position konnte sich Hausser in der HIAG nicht durchsetzen. Intern häufig als „Senior“ bezeichnet, wird Haussers herausgehobene Rolle in der HIAG als „Spiritus Rector“ eingeschätzt. So wurde im Januar 1958 auf Haussers Intervention hin sein Vertrauter Otto Weidinger zum HIAG-Bundessprecher gewählt. 1962 benannte die HIAG ihr Sozialwerk nach Hausser. Bis zu seinem Tod war Hausser stets bereit, sich „nahezu unbesehen vor jeden Angehörigen ‚seiner‘ ehemaligen Waffen-SS zu stellen.“ Damit nahm er „sehenden Auges“ auch die zahlreichen an Verbrechen beteiligten Angehörigen dieser Formation in Schutz. Zu Haussers Bestattung 1972 auf dem Waldfriedhof in München kamen Tausende ehemaliger Angehöriger der SS. Die Trauerrede hielt der ehemalige SS-Brigadeführer Otto Kumm. |
G;|Carl Eduard Herzog von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha (getauft als Leopold Charles Edward George Albert, * 19. Juli 1884 in Claremont House, Esher; † 6. März 1954 in Coburg) war von 1905 bis 1918 der letzte regierende Herzog von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha aus dem gleichnamigen Fürstenhaus. Geboren wurde der Enkel der Königin Viktoria des Vereinigten Königreiches von Großbritannien und Irland als Duke of Albany und Prinz von Großbritannien und Irland. Zwischen 1933 und 1945 war er unter anderem Präsident des Deutschen Roten Kreuzes und Obergruppenführer der SA sowie des NSFK.  Herkunft Carl Eduard wurde 1884 in der Grafschaft Surrey geboren und als Leopold Charles Edward George Albert getauft. Sein Rufname war Charles Edward, nach dem Namenspatron Charles Edward Stuart. Seine Eltern waren Leopold, Herzog von Albany, der vierte Sohn von Königin Victoria, und Prinzessin Helene von Waldeck-Pyrmont. Da er erst nach dem Tod seines Vaters zur Welt kam, trug er den Titel eines Herzogs von Albany bereits zur Geburt. Seine ältere Schwester Alice (1883–1981) war die letzte lebende Enkelin Königin Victorias. Die öffentliche Taufe folgte am 4. Dezember 1884. Die Paten waren väterlicherseits sein Onkel, der Kronprinz Eduard, und seine Tanten, die Prinzessinnen Helena und Louise von Großbritannien und Irland, die Prinzessin Friederike von Hannover und Cumberland, und mütterlicherseits sein Großvater, der Fürst von Waldeck und Pyrmont Georg Viktor, sowie sein Onkel, der Erbprinz Friedrich. Landesherr von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha Nach dem Tod von Erbprinz Alfred Alexander, dem einzigen Sohn des Herzogs Alfred von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha, musste die Thronfolge im Herzogtum Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha wieder neu geregelt werden. Da Prinz Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn und nächstjüngerer Bruder Herzog Alfreds, für sich und seinen Sohn auf die Thronfolge verzichtete, wurde 1899 der vierzehnjährige Sohn des verstorbenen gemeinsamen Bruders Leopold, Leopold Charles Edward, als zukünftiger Herzog von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha bestimmt. Im Herbst 1899 übersiedelte er im Alter von 15 Jahren mit seiner Mutter und seiner Schwester von Großbritannien nach Deutschland. Er nannte sich hier Carl Eduard und lebte anfangs im Stuttgarter Schloss bei König Wilhelm II. von Württemberg. Im Frühjahr 1900 zog er mit seiner Mutter und Schwester nach Potsdam, wo sie in der Villa Ingenheim wohnten. Unter der Obhut seines Cousins Kaiser Wilhelm II. erhielt der ehemalige Schüler des Eton College von einem Privatlehrer eine Sondererziehung nach den Lehrplänen eines Realgymnasiums, die er nach einem Jahr mit einem Examen abschloss. Im Herbst 1901 folgte die Ausbildung und Erziehung an der preußischen Hauptkadettenanstalt in Berlin-Lichterfelde, die er im Dezember 1902 mit dem Abitur beendete. Ab 1903 studierte er drei Semester Rechts- und Staatswissenschaften an der Universität Bonn. Dort war er Mitglied im studentischen Corps Borussia. Im Sommer 1904 beendete er das Studium mit dem akademischen Titel Dr. jur. Am 1. Oktober folgte für vier Monate der Eintritt in das 1. Garde-Regiment zu Fuß, um den Dienstgrad eines Leutnants zu erlangen. An seinem 21. Geburtstag 1905 übernahm Carl Eduard die Herrschaft über das Herzogtum Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha, die seit dem Tode Herzog Alfreds im Jahr 1900 durch Ernst zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg als Regent ausgeübt worden war. Am 11. Oktober 1905 heiratete er in Schloss Glücksburg Prinzessin Viktoria Adelheid von Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, eine Nichte der deutschen Kaiserin Auguste Viktoria. Der junge Herzog regierte demonstrativ konservativ und nationalistisch, mit reaktionären Tendenzen. Er war leidenschaftlicher Jäger und reiste viel. Der technikbegeisterte Regent besaß neben einem Salonwagen verschiedene Autos und wandte sich frühzeitig der Luftfahrt zu. Er förderte 1910 in Gotha den Bau eines Landeplatzes mit einer Luftschiffhalle und damit den Ausbau Gothas zur Fliegerstadt mit einer Fliegerschule und ab 1913 mit der Gothaer Waggonfabrik als Flugzeughersteller. Daneben engagierte sich Carl Eduard stark bei der Sanierung und dem Umbau der Veste Coburg und der Veste Wachsenburg. Neben zahlreichen Protektoraten unterstützte der an Rheuma erkrankte Herzog in Oberhof auch den Bobsport und das Golfspiel. Erster Weltkrieg Am Ersten Weltkrieg nahm er als sächsischer General der Kavallerie im Stab des Generalkommandos der 3. Armee teil, die unter anderem das XI. Armee-Korps mit der 38. Division und dem 6. Thüringischen Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 95 umfasste, dem er als Chef vorstand. Dort war er nur formell und hatte, wie bei Bundesfürsten üblich, kein aktives Kommando inne. Er begleitete das Infanterieregiment an die Front und besuchte die Truppe dort oft. 38 % der Kriegsdauer verbrachte er an der Front, bei insgesamt 18 Aufenthalten. Im Dezember 1914 wurde er zum General der Infanterie befördert. Carl Eduard stellte umfangreiche Räumlichkeiten in seinem Schloss in Gotha als Reservelazarett zur Verfügung. Bruch mit Großbritannien Um seine bedingungslose Loyalität zu Deutschland zu demonstrieren, unterzeichnete Carl Eduard am 12. März 1917 ein Gesetz, das außerdeutsche Mitglieder des Hauses Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha von der Thron- und Erbfolge ausschloss, wenn ihr Heimatstaat Krieg gegen das Deutsche Reich führt. Ein Angriff auf London am 17. Juni 1917 mit 17 zweimotorigen Bombern der Gothaer Waggonfabrik kostete 160 Menschenleben und steigerte die antideutsche Stimmung in London. In der Folge verabschiedete das britische Parlament das Gesetz über die Entziehung von Titeln und Auszeichnungen (Titles Deprivation Act). Es war die rechtliche Grundlage für die Aberkennung seiner britischen Adelstitel und -rechte und damit auch seines Sitzes im englischen Oberhaus per Anweisung von König Georg V. von Großbritannien und Irland am 28. März 1919. Außer Carl Eduard als Duke of Albany, Earl of Clarence, Baron Arklow und Prinz von Großbritannien und Irland waren von diesem Gesetz drei weitere Personen betroffen: Ernst August, Kronprinz von Hannover als Herzog von Cumberland und Teviotdale, Earl of Armagh und Prinz von Großbritannien und Irland, ferner Herzog Ernst August von Braunschweig-Lüneburg als Prinz von Großbritannien und Irland sowie außerdem Heinrich Graf von Taaffe als 12. Viscount Taaffe of Corren and Baron of Ballymote. Gemäß dem Titles Deprivation Act haben die männlichen Erben dieser Personen das Recht, die britische Krone um ihre Wiedereinsetzung in diese Titel zu bitten, doch haben sie davon bisher keinen Gebrauch gemacht. Ende der Regentschaft Am 9. November 1918 erklärte der Gothaer Arbeiter- und Soldatenrat Herzog Carl Eduard für abgesetzt. Am 13. November 1918, später als die meisten Bundesfürsten, erklärte er seinen Rücktritt, der am 14. November durch den Staatsminister Hans Barthold von Bassewitz in einer Sitzung des gemeinsamen Landtags in Gotha verkündet wurde und den Thronverzicht auf beide Herzogtümer bedeutete. Damit zerbrach Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha in die beiden Freistaaten Coburg und Gotha. Diese gingen getrennte Wege, als sich Gotha 1920 dem neu geschaffenen Land Thüringen anschloss, während Coburg dem Freistaat Bayern beitrat. Wirken 1918 bis 1945 Dem Freistaat Coburg gelang es, mit Carl Eduard Herzog von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha am 7. Juni 1919 einen Abfindungsvertrag über dessen Besitz- und Vermögensverhältnisse im ehemaligen Herzogtum Sachsen-Coburg zu schließen. Das Abfindungsangebot des Freistaates Sachsen-Gotha in Höhe von 15 Millionen Mark für den Verlust seiner Besitztümer lehnte er jedoch ab. Daher wurde am 31. Juli 1919 das Gesetz über die Einziehung des Gothaischen Hausfideikommiß, des Lichtenberger Fideikommiß, des Ernst-Albert-Fideikommiß, der Schmalkaldener Forsten und des Hausallods von der Gothaer Landesversammlung verabschiedet. Es war die einzige Fürstenenteignung in Deutschland; sie wurde später durch ein Urteil des Reichsgerichts vom 18. Juni 1925 aufgehoben. Er bekam Werte von etwa 37,2 Millionen Reichsmark wieder zugesprochen. Carl Eduard wohnte ab 1918 bis 1945 mit seiner Familie meist im Sommer auf Schloss Callenberg, das sein Eigentum blieb, und im Winter auf der sanierten Veste Coburg, wo er Wohnrecht hatte. Ab 1919 suchte der ehemalige Herzog Anschluss an national-konservative und völkische Kreise. Er war von 1917 bis 1922 Mitglied des Bundes der Kaisertreuen. Im Dezember 1919 lernte er den Freikorpsführer Hermann Ehrhardt kennen, den er sowohl ideell als auch materiell unterstützte. Nach dem misslungenen Kapp-Putsch versteckte er den mit Haftbefehl gesuchten Ehrhardt auf Schloss Callenberg. 1920 wurde Carl Eduard Bezirksführer Coburg bei der Brigade Ehrhardt und der Organisation Consul sowie Oberbezirksführer Thüringen der Organisation Consul. Die gleichen, rein repräsentativen Stellungen übernahm er 1923 bei der paramilitärischen Nachfolgeorganisation Bund Wiking. 1926 folgte die Mitgliedschaft im Stahlhelmbund, den er auch finanziell unterstützte. 1930 wurde er Mitglied des Bundesvorstandes, nachdem er 1928 schon Reichsstaffelführer der Reichskraftfahr-Staffel des Stahlhelm geworden war. 1929 übernahm er die Präsidentschaft des Nationalen Deutschen Automobilklubs, durch die Reichskraftfahr-Staffel gegründet. Am 11. Oktober 1931 nahm Carl Eduard am Treffen der Harzburger Front in Bad Harzburg teil und 1932 wurde er Präsident des Berliner Nationalklubs. Hitler lernte am 14. Oktober 1922 Carl Eduard als Ehrengast des Begrüßungs- und Festabends auf dem dritten Deutschen Tag in Coburg persönlich kennen. In den folgenden Jahrzehnten traf er ihn persönlich mindestens noch 21 Mal. Nach den ersten Wahlerfolgen der NSDAP in Coburg im Jahr 1929 unterstützte er die Partei offen. Am 5. Dezember 1929 besuchte Carl Eduard mit seiner Gattin eine Wahlkampfveranstaltung der NSDAP in den Coburger Hofbräugaststätten mit Hitler als Redner. Am 18. Oktober 1931 nahm er am SA-Aufmarsch in Braunschweig teil. Mit einem öffentlichen Aufruf am 23. März 1932 in der Coburger Nationalzeitung unterstützte er bei der Reichspräsidentenwahl Hitler gegen den konservativen Amtsinhaber Hindenburg. Nach der von der NSDAP gewonnenen Reichstagswahl ließ er anlässlich der Machtübernahme in Bayern am 9. März 1933 auf der Veste Coburg die Hakenkreuzfahne hissen und trat zum 1. Mai 1933 in die NSDAP ein. In der Folge erhielt Carl Eduard viele Ehrenämter, damit er sich als hochrangiges Mitglied der NSDAP fühlen konnte, dafür der Partei Ansehen im eigenen Land verlieh und im Ausland als Aushängeschild mit internationaler Reputation unterstützte. 1933 wurde er Mitglied der Allgemeinen SS, und zwar „förderndes Mitglied“. Ende Juli 1933 wurde er zum SA-Gruppenführer im Stabe des Obersten SA-Führers ernannt und 1938 von Hitler zum SA-Obergruppenführer befördert. Zum 1. Dezember 1933 ernannte ihn der Reichspräsident zum Präsidenten des Deutschen Roten Kreuzes und im Januar 1934 zum Reichskommissar der freiwilligen Krankenpflege. 1933 wurde er Reichsbeauftragter für das Kraftfahrwesen und mit der Mitgliedsnummer 2230 Ehrenführer sowie 1935 Obergruppenführer des Nationalsozialistischen Kraftfahrerkorps NSKK. Weitere Ämter folgten, wie 1933 Senator der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften, 1934 Repräsentant der Reichsregierung im Ausland, 1935 Präsident der Deutsch-Englischen Gesellschaft Berlin, 1936 Reichstagsabgeordneter und Präsident der Vereinigung der deutschen Frontkämpferverbände sowie 1938 Präsident des Ständigen Internationalen Ausschusses ehemaliger Frontkämpfer. Angeblich soll er auch Leiter der Anglo-German-Fellowship gewesen sein. Allerdings gibt es keine Quellen, die das belegen. Im Zuge der Gründung des Nationalsozialistischen Fliegerkorps im April 1937 kam es zur Ernennung zum Ehrenführer der deutschen Luftfahrt mit dem Range eines Fliegerkommodore sowie zum NSFK-Obergruppenführer. Ferner war Carl Eduard in der Wirtschaft als Mitglied in diversen Aufsichtsräten tätig, u. a. seit 1928 bei der Wanderer Werke AG und Rhein-Metall-Borsig AG, ab 1933 bei der Deutscher Ring Lebensversicherung AG, ab 1934 bei der Deutschen Bank und Discontogesellschaft sowie der Deutschen Centralboden-Kredit AG und ab 1938 als Vorsitzender bei der Europäischen Güter- und Reisegepäckversicherung AG. Aufgrund seiner weltläufigen Erfahrungen vertrat der Nationalsozialist Carl Eduard das DRK und auch das Deutsche Reich vor allem gegenüber dem Ausland. Dazu unternahm er von 1933 bis 1944 39 Auslandsreisen und zwei Weltreisen. Sein Stellvertreter als Präsident des Deutschen Roten Kreuzes und Reichskommissar der freiwilligen Krankenpflege war Paul Hocheisen, ab 1937 Ernst-Robert Grawitz. Nach einem verlorenen Machtkampf um Kompetenzen im Jahr 1934 verblieben ihm reine Repräsentationsaufgaben, die eigentlichen Amtsgeschäfte führte Hocheisen. Im selben Jahr begab er sich auf seine erste Weltreise. Sie dauerte vier Monate und führte über England, Kanada, USA, Japan, China, Singapur, Indien, Ägypten und Italien. Er sollte unter anderem das Deutsche Reich bei der XV. Internationalen Konferenz des Internationalen Komitees vom Roten Kreuz in Tokio vertreten. In Japan wurde er auch vom Kaiserpaar empfangen. Im Dezember 1935 wurde Carl Eduard in London zum Präsidenten der Deutsch-Englischen Gesellschaft gewählt, und im Januar 1936 vertrat er offiziell das Deutsche Reich bei der Trauerfeier des Königs des Vereinigten Königreichs von Großbritannien und Irland Georg. Im Leichenzug schritt Carl Eduard in der sechsten Reihe hinter der Lafette mit dem Sarg und trug eine Generalsuniform der Wehrmacht sowie einen Stahlhelm vom Typ M35. Zwischen Februar und Juni 1940 unternahm er als Präsident des DRK und Sonderbotschafter der Reichsregierung eine zweite Weltreise, die über die Sowjetunion und Japan in die USA und zurück führte. Der fünfwöchige, inoffizielle Besuch der USA hatte den Deckmantel eines humanitären, karitativen Charakters und diente aber vor allem einer positiven Darstellung Deutschlands. Am 18. März 1940 wurde er auch von Präsident Franklin D. Roosevelt empfangen. Auf eine Journalistenfrage, ob die Juden in Polen hinsichtlich der Versorgung und Hilfeleistung einer Sonderbehandlung unterworfen würden, antwortete er wahrheitswidrig, dass das Rote Kreuz keine Unterschiede kenne. Auf der Rückreise wurde Carl Eduard am 30. April 1940 vom japanischen Kaiser Hirohito offiziell empfangen. Er überbrachte dabei die Glückwünsche des Deutschen Reiches zum 2600-jährigen Bestehen des Kaiserreiches. Auf der Rückreise hatte er in Moskau am 31. Mai 1940 eine Unterredung mit Wjatscheslaw Michailowitsch Molotow. Initiativen von Mitgliedern der schwedischen Königsfamilie, seine Tochter hatte 1932 den Erbprinzen Gustav Adolf von Schweden geheiratet, Opfern des NS-Regimes zu helfen unterstützte er nicht. Eine Bitte von Prinz Eugen von Schweden im März 1942, eine Ausreisegenehmigung in die USA für Martha Liebermann, der Witwe von Max Liebermann, zu erwirken leitete er ohne weitere Schritte an Reinhard Heydrich weiter. Aufgrund einer Einzelgenehmigung, die seine Verdienste und seine Loyalität zum NS-Regime berücksichtigte, fand der Führererlass über die Fernhaltung international gebundener Männer von maßgebenden Stellen in Staat, Partei und Wehrmacht vom 19. Mai 1943 keine Anwendung. Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg Nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs wurde Carl Eduard am 4. Juni 1945 in Coburg von der US-Armee inhaftiert und bis Ende 1946 interniert. Anfangs wegen Verbrechen gegen die Menschlichkeit angeklagt, wurde Carl Eduard, dem mehrere Persilscheine ausgestellt worden waren und der sich keiner Schuld bewusst war, 1950 im Spruchkammerverfahren nach mehreren Berufungsverfahren als Mitläufer und Minderbelasteter zu einer Sühneleistung von 5000 DM verurteilt. Carl Eduard Herzog von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha starb 1954 als vorletzter ehemaliger deutscher Bundesfürst im Alter von 70 Jahren an einer Krebserkrankung. Er wurde auf dem 1944 angelegten Friedhof der Familie im Forst von Schloss Callenberg bestattet. |
G;Tobias Angerer (* 12. April 1977 in Traunstorf, Ortsteil Traunsteins) ist ein ehemaliger deutscher Skilangläufer, der für den SC Vachendorf startete. Angerer gewann 2006 und 2007 jeweils die Gesamtwertung des Skilanglauf-Weltcups und die Disziplinenwertung für Distanzrennen. Bei Weltmeisterschaften und Olympischen Spielen gewann er in seiner Karriere insgesamt elf Medaillen.  Angerer stammt aus einer wintersportbegeisterten Familie. Sein Onkel Anton Angerer war Mitglied der deutschen Biathlon-Nationalmannschaft. Auch Angerers Schwester Kathrin war jahrelang aktive Skilangläuferin. 1996 absolvierte er das Abitur am Skigymnasium Berchtesgaden. Seitdem gehört er der Sportfördergruppe der Bundeswehr in Berchtesgaden an. Angerer ist mit der Anwältin und ehemaligen Biathletin Romy Groß liiert. Im September 2008 wurden sie Eltern einer Tochter. Ein Jahr später heirateten Groß und Angerer. Im August 2011 brachte Romy einen Sohn zur Welt. Das Paar lebt mit Groß’ Tochter aus einer früheren Beziehung und den beiden gemeinsamen Kindern in Traunstein.  Anfangsjahre (1993 bis 2001) Der an der Langlaufloipe aufgewachsene begeisterte Sportler (Fußball, Tennis, Ski Alpin, Skilanglauf) stand bereits im Alter von zwei Jahren auf Langlaufski. Früh konnte Angerer auf Jugend- und Juniorenebene zahlreiche nationale Erfolge feiern. So gewann er zwischen 1993 und 1997 insgesamt sechs deutsche Meistertitel. 1996 nahm er bei den Juniorenweltmeisterschaften in Asiago an seinem ersten internationalen Wettbewerb teil. Beim Sieg von Per Elofsson über 10 Kilometer klassisch belegte er direkt hinter Lukáš Bauer den 18. Platz. Mit der Staffel verpasste er knapp eine Medaille und belegte den vierten Platz. Ein Jahr später in Canmore reichte es über die 10 Kilometer klassisch nur zum 28. Platz. Auch über 30 Kilometer Freistil konnte er nur den 26. Platz belegen. Mit der Staffel erreichte er den siebenten Platz. In der Saison 1997/98 startete Angerer zum ersten Mal bei den Senioren und konnte seinen ersten deutschen Meistertitel (Staffel) feiern. International startete er im Skilanglauf-Europacup. Sein bestes Resultat war der achte Platz über 15 Kilometer klassisch in Breitenwang. Nach guten Resultaten im Europacup zu Beginn der Saison 1998/99 wurde Angerer am 27. Dezember 1998 erstmals im Skilanglauf-Weltcup eingesetzt. Beim Sprint in Garmisch-Partenkirchen erreichte er die Finalläufe und konnte als 22. seine ersten Weltcup-Punkte verbuchen. In den Distanz-Wettbewerben konnte er jedoch nicht mit der Weltspitze mithalten. Sein bestes Resultat war der 65. Platz in Seefeld über 10 Kilometer Freistil. Am Ende der Saison belegte er den dritten Platz in der Gesamtwertung des Europacups. In der Saison 1999/2000 gelang Angerer zusammen mit Peter Schlickenrieder in der Sprintstaffel beim Weltcup in Asiago der erst dritte Weltcupsieg eines Deutschen überhaupt. In der Saison 2000/01 konnte Angerer unter anderem durch seinen ersten Sieg und mehrere Podiumsplatzierungen die Gesamtwertung des Europacups für sich entscheiden. Zum Ende der Saison gelang ihm im finnischen Kuopio über die selten gelaufene Distanz von 60 Kilometern Freistil mit Platz 17 sein bis dahin bestes Ergebnis im Weltcup. Durchbruch (2001 bis 2005) Der sportliche Durchbruch in die Weltspitze gelang Tobias Angerer in der Saison 2001/02. Direkt zum Auftakt der Saison belegte er in Kuopio den ersten Platz über die Distanz von 10 Kilometer Freistil. Einen Monat später konnte er sich in Ramsau mit Platz zehn über 30 Kilometer Freistil (Massenstart) über sein erstes Top-Ten-Resultat freuen. Beim Sprint im Val di Fiemme schaffte er mit Platz fünf sein bestes Saison-Resultat. Diese guten Ergebnisse sicherten ihm einen Platz im deutschen Aufgebot für die Olympischen Winterspiele 2002 in Salt Lake City. Zusammen mit Jens Filbrich, Andreas Schlütter und René Sommerfeldt gewann Angerer im Staffelwettbewerb die Bronzemedaille und somit die erste Medaille einer deutschen Herrenstaffel überhaupt. Im Sprintwettbewerb erreicht er das Halbfinale und belegte den siebten Platz im Endergebnis. Im Verfolgungswettbewerb reichte es für den 23. Platz und über 30 Kilometer Freistil (Massenstart) zum 33. Platz. Nach zahlreichen guten Resultaten vor allem in Sprintwettbewerben gelang es Angerer zum Ende der Saison, auch in einem Distanzwettbewerb in die Weltspitze vorzustoßen. Über 50 Kilometer Freistil in Oslo belegte er den sechsten Platz. Zum Abschluss der Saison konnte er einen 14. Platz in der Gesamtwertung des Skilanglauf-Weltcups vorweisen und sich somit einen Startplatz in der roten Gruppe sichern. Darüber hinaus gewann er drei deutsche Meistertitel. Auch in der darauffolgenden Saison konnte sich Angerer in der erweiterten Weltspitze festsetzen. Beim Verfolgungswettbewerb in Ramsau gelang ihm hinter Axel Teichmann und Anders Södergren seine erste Podiumsplatzierung in einem Einzelwettbewerb im Weltcup. Dieses Resultat konnte er beim Sprint in Reit im Winkl wiederholen. Zusammen mit René Sommerfeldt belegte er den zweiten Platz beim Teamsprint in Asiago. Die Nordischen Skiweltmeisterschaften 2003 im Val di Fiemme begannen für Angerer jedoch mit einer herben Enttäuschung. Den Verfolgungswettbewerb beendete er nur als 60. von 67 Läufern. Im anschließenden Sprintwettbewerb erreichte er hingegen das Finale, musste sich jedoch den anderen drei Läufern geschlagen geben und verpasste als Vierter knapp seine erste internationale Einzelmedaille. Über 50 Kilometer Freistil reichte es wiederum nur zu einem 36. Platz. In der Weltcup-Gesamtwertung konnte sich Angerer um einen Platz im Vergleich zur Vorsaison verbessern und belegte in der Endabrechnung den 13. Rang. Am 6. Januar 2004 feierte Angerer im Verfolgungswettbewerb in Falun seinen ersten Weltcupsieg. In einem umkämpften Rennen siegte er im Spurt von dem Italiener Pietro Piller Cottrer, René Sommerfeldt und Jens Filbrich. Nach zahlreichen weiteren guten Platzierungen belegte er am Ende der Saison im Gesamtweltcup, der von Sommerfeldt gewonnen wurde, den vierten Rang. Dieses Resultat konnte er auch in der darauffolgenden Saison 2004/05 wiederholen. In der Disziplinenwertung der Distanzrennen verbesserte er sich auf den dritten Gesamtrang. Bei den Nordischen Skiweltmeisterschaften 2005 in Oberstdorf gelang es Angerer jedoch erneut nicht, in einem Einzelwettbewerb die Ergebnisse aus dem Weltcup zu bestätigen. Vor heimischer Kulisse belegte er über die 15 Kilometer Freistil den 19. Platz. Auch im Verfolgungswettbewerb reichte es nur zu einem 17. Platz. Doch im Staffelwettbewerb konnte er mit dem deutschen Team endlich die erhoffte Medaille gewinnen. Angerer kämpfte sich als dritter Läufer im Team vom neunten auf den vierten Platz vor. Schlussläufer Axel Teichmann erkämpfte mit der schnellsten Zeit auf seiner Runde im Schlussspurt gegen Russland die Silbermedaille hinter der Weltmeisterstaffel aus Norwegen. Höhepunkte (2005 bis 2010) In der Saison 2005/06 erkämpfte sich Angerer kontinuierlich Platzierungen in den Top-Ten. Er erreichte acht Podiumsplatzierungen, darunter fünf Weltcupsiege (Oberstdorf, Val di Fiemme, Canmore, Vernon und Kuusamo). Damit sicherte er sich souverän den Sieg in der Gesamtwertung des Skilanglaufweltcups. In der Endabrechnung wies Angerer 829 Punkte auf, während der Zweitplatzierte Norweger Jens Arne Svartedal nur 577 Punkte auf seinem Konto verbuchen konnte. Nach Sommerfeldt und Teichmann war Angerer der dritte Deutsche, der den Gesamtweltcup gewinnen konnte. Auch die Wertung der Distanzwettbewerbe konnte er in dieser Saison für sich entscheiden. Der Höhepunkt der Saison waren die Olympischen Winterspiele 2006 in Turin. Beim Verfolgungswettbewerb konnte der Seriensieger der Saison am Ende nicht mehr mit der Spitzengruppe mithalten und belegte einen für ihn enttäuschenden zwölften Rang. Über die Distanz von 15 Kilometern klassisch sicherte sich Angerer jedoch hinter dem Esten Andrus Veerpalu und Lukáš Bauer die Bronzemedaille. Dies war für Angerer die erste internationale Medaille in einem Einzelwettbewerb. In der Staffel konnte das deutsche Team an die erfolgreiche Bilanz der letzten Jahre anknüpfen. Schlussläufer Angerer sicherte im Schlussspurt gegen den Schweden Mathias Fredriksson die Silbermedaille hinter der siegreichen italienischen Staffel, die vor heimischen Publikum über sich hinauswuchs. Im abschließenden Massenstartwettbewerb über 50 Kilometer Freistil konnte Angerer nur den 24. Platz belegen. Angerer knüpfe auch in der Saison 2006/07 an seine Siegesserie der Vorsaison an und lief im Weltcup wiederum acht Mal auf das Podest. Zu den vier Weltcupsiegen (La Clusaz, Changchun und Falun), die er in dieser Saison feiern konnte, gehörte auch der Sieg bei der erstmals ausgetragenen Tour de Ski. Am Ende der Saison hatte Angerer mit 1131 Punkten mehr als doppelt so viel Zähler auf seinem Konto als der Zweitplatzierte Russe Alexander Legkow. Bei den Nordischen Skiweltmeisterschaften 2007 in Sapporo konnte sich Angerer bei all seinen fünf Starts unter den besten Vier platzieren. Über die 50 Kilometer klassisch, in der Staffel und im Teamsprint, den er zusammen mit Axel Teichmann bestritt, verpasste er als Vierter jeweils den Sprung auf das Siegerpodest. Im Verfolgungswettbewerb musste er sich im Schlussspurt nur Axel Teichmann geschlagen geben. Seine zweite Medaille erkämpfte er über 15 Kilometer Freistil. Dieser Wettbewerb war durch starken Schneefall geprägt, der vor allem die besten 30 Läufer der Weltcupwertung stark behinderte. Hinter dem norwegischen Biathleten und Überraschungsweltmeister Lars Berger und dem bis dahin unbekannten Weißrussen Leanid Karnijenka gewann er die Bronzemedaille. Die Saison 2007/08 verlief für Angerer wie für den Großteil des deutschen Teams, das ihr Training umgestellt hatte, enttäuschend. Zu Beginn der Saison konnte er sich zwar noch mehrmals unter den Top-Ten platzieren, wurde bei der Tour de Ski jedoch nur 14. und erreichte zu Mitte und Ende der Saison nur Platzierungen um den 20. Platz. Am Ende der Saison blieb für den überragenden Läufer der letzten beiden Jahre nur der 16. Platz im Gesamtweltcup. Ein versöhnlicher Saisonabschluss gelang ihm bei den Militär-Weltmeisterschaften in Hochfilzen/Fieberbrunn. Der Sportsoldat gewann jeweils die Silbermedaille im Einzelwettkampf über 15 Kilometer hinter Vincent Vittoz und in der Mannschaftswertung zusammen mit Tom Reichelt und Benjamin Seifert. Auch zu Beginn der Saison 2008/09 konnte Angerer bisher nicht an frühere Erfolge anknüpfen. Zwar gewann er den international sehr gut besetzten Vorbereitungswettbewerb in Muonio, aber zum Saisonauftakt in Gällivare blieb nur der 30. Platz. Nach zahlreichen krankheitsbedingten Rückschlägen, die ihn unter anderem zur Aufgabe bei der Tour de Ski 2008/09 zwangen, meldete er sich mit einem Sieg beim Weltcup in Rybinsk über 15 Kilometer Freistil (Massenstart) in der Weltspitze zurück. Bei den Nordischen Skiweltmeisterschaften 2009 in Liberec holte sich Angerer sowohl Silber im Teamsprint als auch zusammen mit Jens Filbrich, Franz Göring und Axel Teichmann Silber in der 4x10-km-Staffel. Am Schlusstag dieser Titelkämpfe holte sich Angerer Bronze über die 50 KM Freistil. Er beendete die Saison als 15. im Gesamtweltcup. In der Gesamtwertung der Distanzrennen belegte er den neunten Platz. Angerer konzentrierte sich in der Saison 2009/10 ganz auf die Olympischen Winterspiele in Vancouver. Nach mäßigen Resultaten in den ersten Weltcupwettbewerben sicherte er sich überraschend mit Platz zwei im Sprint in Rogla die Nominierung für die Olympischen Spiele. Wie schon im Vorjahr musste er die Tour de Ski erkältungsbedingt nach der fünften Etappe beenden. Angerer verzichtete auf die folgenden Weltcupwettbewerbe und bestritt stattdessen den zum Skilanglauf-Marathon-Cup zählenden Dolomitenlauf, wo er den zweiten Platz belegte. In Vancouver erkämpfte er im ersten Rennen über 15 Kilometer Freistil den siebenten Platz. Am 20. Februar 2010 gewann er in der Doppelverfolgung hinter dem Schweden Marcus Hellner die Silbermedaille. Mit der deutschen Staffel konnte er jedoch nicht die erhoffte Medaille gewinnen und kam als Schlussläufer auf Platz sechs ins Ziel. Im abschließenden Wettbewerb über 50 Kilometer klassisch (Massenstart) gehörte Angerer bis zum Schluss zur Spitzengruppe. Im Zielsprint musste er sich jedoch Petter Northug, Axel Teichmann und Johan Olsson (Skilangläufer) geschlagen geben und belegte den undankbaren vierten Platz. Zum Abschluss der Saison gelang Angerer mit dem zweiten Platz auf der vorletzten Etappe des Weltcup-Finales seine beste Saisonplatzierung in einem Distanzrennen. Er beendete die Saison als 14. im Gesamtweltcup. Letzte Jahre (2010 bis 2014) In der Saison 2010/11 konnte er seine starken Leistungen aus der Vorsaison nicht wiederholen. Nach schwachen Start in die Saison mit dem 44. Rang über 15 km Freistil in Gällivare und den 23. Gesamtrang bei der Nordic Opening in Kuusamo beendete er auch die Tour de Ski 2010/11 nach der zweiten Etappe vorzeitig. National wurde er im Januar 2011 in Hirschau deutscher Meister über 15 km. Im folgenden Monat kam er beim im Weltcup in Rybinsk mit dem vierten Rang im 20 km Verfolgungsrennen erstmals in der Saison unter den ersten Zehn im Weltcup. Zwei Tage später wurde er mit der Staffel Dritter. Bei den Nordischen Skiweltmeisterschaften 2011 in Oslo gewann er mit der Staffel die Bronzemedaille. In den Einzelrennen belegte er den neunten Platz über 15 km klassisch, den achten Rang im 30 km Verfolgungsrennen und den sechsten Platz im 50 km Massenstartrennen. Beim folgenden Weltcup in Lahti erreichte er mit dem neunten Rang im 20 km Verfolgungsrennen seine zweite Top Zehn Platzierung in der Weltcupsaison. Zum Saisonende errang er beim Weltcupfinale in Falun den 19. Platz und erreichte im Gesamtweltcup den 41. Platz. In der folgenden Saison kam er bei 14 Weltcupeinzelteilnahmen, 12 mal in die Punkteränge und dreimal unter den ersten Zehn. Dabei beendete er zu Beginn der Saison die Nordic Opening in Kuusamo auf den 16. Rang und die Tour de Ski 2011/12 auf den 11. Platz. Beim Weltcup in Rybinsk belegte er im Skiathlon und im 15 km Massenstartrennen den dritten Platz. Im März 2012 holte er beim Weltcupfinale in Falun den 17. Gesamtrang und erreichte im Gesamt- und im Distanzweltcup jeweils den 11. Platz. Nach schwachen Start in die Saison 2012/13 mit dem 38. Rang bei der Nordic Opening belegte er beim folgenden Weltcup in Canmore den vierten Platz im Skiathlon und den dritten Rang im 15 km Massenstartrennen. Bei der Tour de Ski 2012/13 kam er auf den 15. Platz. Es folgten mit dem fünften Platz über 15 km klassisch in Lahti und den sechsten Rang beim Skiathlon in Sotschi weitere Top Zehn Platzierungen. Ebenfalls in Sotschi errang er zusammen mit Axel Teichmann den dritten Platz im Teamsprint. Seine besten Platzierungen bei den Nordischen Skiweltmeisterschaften 2013 im Val di Fiemme waren der neunte Platz im Skiathlon und der siebte Rang mit der Staffel. Zum Saisonende kam er beim Weltcupfinale in Falun auf den 24. Rang und belegte den 14. Platz im Gesamtweltcup und den neunten Platz im Distanzweltcup. In der folgenden Saison kam er bei sechs Weltcupteilnahmen zweimal in die Punkteränge und davon einmal unter den ersten Zehn. Die Nordic Opening in Kuusamo beendete er auf den 56. Platz. Nach dem 50-km-Rennen am 8. März 2014 in Oslo beendete Tobias Angerer seine aktive Laufbahn. Zuvor hatte er in Sotschi zum vierten Mal an Olympischen Spielen teilgenommen, wo er im Skiathlon den 14. Platz belegte. 
G;|Franz Joseph Haydn (* 31. März oder 1. April 1732 in Rohrau, Niederösterreich; † 31. Mai 1809 in Wien) war Komponist zur Zeit der Wiener Klassik. Er war Bruder des Komponisten Michael Haydn und des Tenors Johann Evangelist Haydn. Den größeren Teil seiner beruflichen Laufbahn verbrachte Joseph Haydn als Hofmusiker auf dem Landsitz der wohlhabenden ungarischen Familie Esterházy, wo er deren Orchester und Oper leitete. Die Abgeschiedenheit von anderen Komponisten und musikalischen Strömungen beschrieb er mit dem bekannten Zitat: „Ich war von der Welt abgesondert, niemand in meiner Nähe konnte mich an mir selbst irremachen und quälen, und so musste ich original werden.“ 1797 vertonte Haydn für den Kaiser des Heiligen Römischen Reiches Franz II. das hierzu bei Lorenz Leopold Haschka ebenfalls vom Hof bestellte Gedicht Gott! erhalte Franz, den Kaiser, Unsern guten Kaiser Franz!. Die Melodie war bis zum Ende der Habsburgermonarchie 1918 die der Österreichischen Kaiserhymnen und fand auch danach noch in der Ersten Republik Anwendung. Im Jahr 1841 wurde ihr das extra hierzu gedichtete Lied der Deutschen von Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben unterlegt, das in dieser Form 1922 die Hymne des damaligen Deutschen Reiches wurde.  Kindheit und Jugend Joseph Haydn wurde als zweites von zwölf Kindern des Wagners und späteren Marktrichters Mathias Haydn und seiner Mutter Maria Haydn (geb. Koller) im Dorf Rohrau, Obere Hauptstraße 25, im Erzherzogtum Österreich, dem heutigen Niederösterreich, geboren. Zwar konnten beide Eltern keine Musiknoten lesen, aber nach Haydns Erinnerungen wurde in seiner Familie und mit den Nachbarn häufig gesungen. Seine musikalische Begabung wurde entdeckt, als er ein kleines Kind war. Im Alter von sechs Jahren wurde Haydn 1738 zu Verwandten in das nahe Hainburg an der Donau geschickt. Im Jahr 1740 wurde er von Georg von Reutter, dem musikalischen Direktor des Stephansdoms in Wien, bemerkt, als dieser durch die Provinzen reiste, um talentierte Chorknaben zu finden. Reutter nahm Haydn mit nach Wien, wo er neun Jahre als Chorsänger lebte, davon die letzten vier in Gesellschaft seines jüngeren Bruders Michael. Die fälschliche Behauptung, Haydn habe 1741 beim Begräbnis Antonio Vivaldis gesungen, wurde 1978 von Alan Kendall in die Welt gesetzt, der die beim Kondukt als anwesend verzeichneten „6 Kuttenbuben“ im Bahrleiherbuch der Wiener Dompfarre irrig als „Choirboys“ bezeichnete. Diese „Kuttenbuben“ (Ministranten) falteten nur die Hände und gaben keinen Ton von sich. Da Vivaldi nur ein „Kleingleuth“ erhielt und keine Musik bezahlt worden war, erklang bei seiner Einsegnung keine Musik und Haydn hatte mit Vivaldis Einsegnung nichts zu tun. In der Domkapelle erhielt Haydn Gesangs-, Klavier- und Violinunterricht. Reutter korrigierte Haydns erste Kompositionen, gab ihm aber keinen geregelten Kompositionsunterricht. Dennoch lernte Haydn viel – großenteils im Selbstunterricht und wohl allein schon dadurch, dass er in jungen Jahren als professioneller Musiker an einem für die Musik wichtigen Ort war. Ob er bereits in dieser Zeit oder erst in späteren Jahren Johann Matthesons Der vollkommene Capellmeister und die Kompositionslehre Gradus ad Parnassum von Johann Joseph Fux durchstudierte, ist nach den Quellen nicht eindeutig zu entscheiden. Beide Werke nannte der erwachsene Komponist als grundlegend für seine Entwicklung. Freischaffender Musiker 1749 war Haydns Stimmbruch abgeschlossen, so dass er die hohen Stimmen im Chor nicht mehr singen konnte. Er wurde aus seiner Stelle entlassen und begann eine Karriere als freier Musiker. Im Laufe dieser beschwerlichen, zehn Jahre dauernden Periode ging Haydn vielen verschiedenen Tätigkeiten nach, unter anderem als Kammerdiener und Begleiter des italienischen Komponisten Nicola Porpora. Er bemühte sich, die Lücken in seiner Ausbildung zu füllen, und schrieb schließlich seine ersten Streichquartette und seine erste Oper. Während dieser Zeit stieg Haydns professionelles Ansehen allmählich. Zwischen 1754 und 1756 war Haydn auch freischaffend für den Wiener Hof tätig. Er fungierte als „Extra Musicus“ bei Bällen der kaiserlichen Familie während des Karnevals und wurde in der Fastenzeit auch als supplierender Sänger in der Hofkapelle verwendet. Seit 1754 gab der junge Haydn der 1744 in Wien geborenen späteren Komponistin Marianna Martines Klavierunterricht. Zu Beginn dieser Ausbildung soll Marianna Martines schon hervorragend gespielt haben. Haydn wohnte im selben Haus und erteilte ihr täglich gegen freie Kost Unterricht. Musikdirektor beim Grafen von Morzin Vermutlich 1757 erhielt Haydn seine erste wichtige Stelle als Musikdirektor des Grafen Karl von Morzin auf Schloss Dolní Lukavice bei Pilsen. Auf dieses Jahr datierte Haydn seine erste in Morzins Diensten komponierte Sinfonie. Als Musikdirektor dirigierte er ein kleines Orchester, und für dieses Ensemble schrieb er seine ersten Sinfonien, Streichtrios, Cassationen und Streichquartette. Diese verbreiteten sich bald, oft in Abschriften; in den Druck gelangten sie nicht. Am 26. November 1760 heiratete Joseph Haydn im Wiener Stephansdom die zwei Jahre ältere Maria Anna Theresia Keller, die Tochter von Johann Petrus Keller, einem aus Hamburg stammenden und damals noch wohlhabenden, hofbefreiten Perückenmacher. Die Ehe stellte sich bald als unglücklich heraus: Seine Frau war streitsüchtig, hatte wenig Verständnis für seine Musik und blieb kinderlos, was Haydn sehr bedauerte. Graf Morzin geriet bald darauf in finanzielle Schwierigkeiten, die ihn zwangen, seine musikalischen Unternehmungen aufzugeben. Kapellmeister bei den Esterházys (1761–1790) Haydn wurde schnell eine ähnliche Stelle der Familie Esterházy angeboten, einer der wohlhabendsten und wichtigsten Magnatenfamilien im damaligen Königreich Ungarn, zunächst als Vizekapellmeister. Als der alte Kapellmeister Gregor Joseph Werner 1766 starb, wurde Haydn zum Ersten Kapellmeister befördert. Nun konnte er endlich auch geistliche Werke komponieren, was Werner sich bis dahin vorbehalten hatte. Sein 1767 verfasstes Stabat Mater hebt sich sowohl bezüglich des zeitlichen Umfangs als auch hinsichtlich der Instrumentierung von anderen Vertonungen dieser Sequenz ab. Als livrierter Musiker im Rang eines Hausoffiziers der Esterházys folgte Haydn der Familie in die drei Hauptresidenzen: den Familiensitz in Eisenstadt, ungefähr 50 km von Wien; den Winterpalast in Wien, und Eszterháza, ein großes, neues Schloss, das in den 1780ern im ländlichen Ungarn gebaut wurde. Haydn hatte ein weites Feld an Verantwortlichkeiten, unter anderem Komposition, Leitung des Orchesters, Spielen von Kammermusik für und mit seinem Patron, und schließlich das Arrangieren von Opernproduktionen. Trotz des enormen Arbeitspensums fühlte sich Haydn in seiner Stelle glücklich. Die Esterházy-Fürsten (erst Paul Anton, dann vor allem Nikolaus I.) waren Musikkenner, die seine Arbeit schätzten und ihm das nötige Umfeld für seine künstlerische Entwicklung gaben, darunter den täglichen Zugang zu seinem eigenen kleinen Orchester. In der Saison zwischen Februar und November fielen 100 bis 150 Aufführungen (Dirigate) an. Mit Luigia Polzelli, einer Sängerin im Esterházy-Unternehmen, hatte Haydn eine längere Affäre. Ohne jegliche Beweise wird immer wieder spekuliert, er sei der Vater ihres Sohnes Anton. Während der fast dreißig Jahre, die Haydn im Hause Esterházy arbeitete, produzierte er eine Flut von Kompositionen, und sein musikalischer Stil entwickelte sich ständig weiter. Seine Popularität in der Außenwelt vergrößerte sich ebenfalls. Allmählich schrieb Haydn ebenso viel für Veröffentlichungen wie für seinen Arbeitgeber, und einige wichtige Werke dieser Periode, wie die Pariser Sinfonien (1785–1786) und die ursprüngliche Orchesterversion der Sieben letzten Worte unseres Erlösers am Kreuze (1786), wurden aus dem Ausland in Auftrag gegeben. Seit etwa 1781 entwickelte sich eine enge Freundschaft zwischen Haydn und Mozart, dessen Werk er schon über Jahre hinweg beeinflusst hatte. Die zwei Komponisten genossen es, in Streichquartetten zusammenzuspielen. Haydn war sehr von Mozarts Werk beeindruckt. Er schrieb nun weniger Opern und Konzerte. Mozart bemühte sich, sechs Streichquartette auf dem Niveau zu schreiben, das Haydn mit seiner kurz davor vollendeten Reihe op. 33 erreicht hatte; als Mozart damit fertig war, widmete er die Quartette seinem Freund. Haydn gehörte der Wiener Freimaurerloge Zur wahren Eintracht an, in die er am 11. Februar 1785 aufgenommen wurde. Mozart konnte aber nicht anwesend sein, da er am gleichen Abend, in Anwesenheit seines Vaters Leopold, ein Subskriptionskonzert in der Mehlgrube gab. Durch die Logenzugehörigkeit der beiden Männer erhielt ihre Freundschaft eine zusätzliche Facette. Selbständigkeit (1790–1809) 1790 starb Fürst Nikolaus; sein Nachfolger war völlig unmusikalisch, entließ die gesamte Hofmusik und schickte Haydn in Pension. Dieser akzeptierte darauf ein lukratives Angebot des deutschen Impresarios Johann Peter Salomon, nach England zu gehen und seine neuen Sinfonien mit einem großen Orchester aufzuführen. Die Reisen (1791–1792 und 1794–1795) waren ein großer Erfolg. Das Publikum stürmte Haydns Konzerte, und er erwarb schnell Ruhm und Vermögen. Musikalisch brachten die Besuche in England einige seiner bekanntesten Werke, darunter die Sinfonie mit dem Paukenschlag, die Militärsinfonie, die Londoner Sinfonie, das Reiterquartett und das Zigeunertrio. Haydn überlegte sogar, englischer Bürger zu werden und sich dauerhaft niederzulassen, doch er kehrte nach Wien zurück. Im Juli 1792 trafen sich Haydn und Ludwig van Beethoven in der Godesberger Redoute bei Bonn. Der 21 Jahre alte Beethoven spielte Haydn vor; beide verabredeten, dass er eine zweite Studienreise nach Wien unternehmen solle, um Meisterschüler von Haydn zu werden. 1793 kaufte sich Haydn in der westlich von Wien gelegenen Oberen Windmühle (einem schmalen Areal, das zur Vorstadt Windmühle gehörte und fast vollständig von der wesentlich größeren Vorstadt Gumpendorf umschlossen wurde) ein Haus mit Garten in der Unteren Steingasse Nr. 73, das er nach einigen Umbauten 1797 bezog. Dort entstanden die zwei Oratorien Die Schöpfung und Die Jahreszeiten sowie sechs Messen für die Esterházy-Familie, die zu dieser Zeit wieder von einem musikalisch geneigten Prinzen geführt wurde. Haydn komponierte auch die letzten neun einer langen Reihe von Streichquartetten, unter anderem das Kaiserquartett, das Quintenquartett und das Sonnenaufgangsquartett. Trotz seines fortschreitenden Alters schaute Haydn in die Zukunft; in einem Brief schrieb er: „Oh Gott, wie viel ist noch zu tun in dieser herrlichen Kunst!“ Im Jahre 1800 verstarb Haydns Frau während eines Kuraufenthalts in Baden bei Wien. Ab 1802 spürte Haydn, dass eine Krankheit, an der er schon seit einiger Zeit gelitten hatte, sich so weit verschlimmert hatte, dass er körperlich nicht mehr in der Lage war, zu komponieren oder öffentlich aufzutreten. Dies war zweifellos sehr schwierig für ihn, da – wie er eingestand – der Strom an frischen musikalischen Ideen, die auf Ausarbeitung warteten, nicht aufhörte. Haydn wurde von seinen Dienern gut gepflegt und empfing viele Besuche und öffentliche Ehren während dieser letzten Jahre, aber es können keine sehr glücklichen Jahre für ihn gewesen sein. Während seiner Krankheit fand er oft am Klavier Trost beim Spielen der Kaiserhymne „Gott! erhalte Franz, den Kaiser, Unsern guten Kaiser Franz!“, die er allerdings nicht in erster Linie als patriotische Geste eines Untertanen des Erzherzogs von Österreich, sondern als Auftragswerk des Kaiserhofs des Heiligen Römischen Reiches auf das ebenfalls dazu in Auftrag gegebene Gedicht des Ex-Jesuiten und Freimaurers Lorenz Leopold Haschka komponiert hatte und das 1797 am Geburtstag des Kaisers Franz II. in dessen und beider Schöpfer Anwesenheit im Burgtheater am Wiener Michaelerplatz zur allgemeinen Befriedigung uraufgeführt wurde. Tod und Grablegung Haydn starb 1809 an allgemeiner Entkräftung, während die französische Armee unter Napoleon in Wien eindrang (siehe Geschichte Wiens). Zu seinen letzten Worten gehörte der Versuch, die Diener zu beruhigen, als in der Nachbarschaft Kanonenschüsse fielen. Joseph Haydn wurde auf dem Hundsturmer Friedhof (heute Haydnpark in Wien-Meidling) beigesetzt. 1814 stiftete sein Schüler Sigismund von Neukomm ein Grabmal, das noch heute dort zu sehen ist. Es zeigt einen fünfstimmigen Rätselkanon Neukomms auf die Worte „Non omnis moriar“. Die Familie Esterházy zeigte zunächst kein Interesse, den Toten angemessen zu würdigen. Erst die Bewunderung von Adolphus Frederick, 1. Duke of Cambridge, erinnerte Fürst Nikolaus II. wieder an den ehemaligen Bediensteten und dessen Genie. Er ließ Joseph Haydn 1820 exhumieren und nach Eisenstadt in die Bergkirche (auch Haydnkirche) überführen. Als bei diesen Arbeiten der Sarg geöffnet wurde, fehlte der Schädel des Komponisten. Nachforschungen ergaben, dass der Sekretär des Fürsten Esterházy – Joseph Carl Rosenbaum, ein Anhänger der Schädellehre von Franz Joseph Gall – den Totengräber, einen Gefängnisverwalter sowie zwei Wiener Beamte bestochen hatte, acht Tage nach der Beisetzung heimlich noch einmal das Grab zu öffnen und den Schädel zu stehlen. Das Versteck des gestohlenen Schädels konnte zunächst nicht ermittelt werden, und so wurde der Leichnam ohne Schädel nach Eisenstadt überführt und dort beigesetzt. Später übergab der Gefängnisverwalter Johann Peter der Polizei einen angeblichen Schädel Haydns. Den echten Schädel hinterließ der Sekretär Rosenbaum seinem Freund Peter mit dem Auftrag, die Reliquie dem Musikkonservatorium zu vermachen. Doch weder Peter noch seine Witwe wagten die Herausgabe; der Schädel wanderte noch durch etliche Hände, bis er 1895 in den Besitz der Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Wien gelangte, in deren Sammlung er sich bis 1953 befand. Kurz vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg wurde der Schädel auch durch Professor Julius Tandler untersucht, eingehend beschrieben und mit der Totenmaske Haydns verglichen. Nachdem schon einmal eine Rückgabe des Schädels in letzter Minute gescheitert war, konnte im Jahr 1954 nach einem Festzug von Wien nach Eisenstadt der Schädel mit dem Rest der Gebeine vereint werden. Der Bildhauer Gustinus Ambrosi durfte ihn in den Sarkophag legen und damit endlich nach 145 Jahren die Totenruhe Joseph Haydns herstellen. Charakter und Erscheinung Haydn war unter seinen Zeitgenossen bekannt für seine liebenswürdige und optimistische Persönlichkeit. Er hatte einen kräftigen Sinn für Humor, der in seiner Liebe zu Streichen hervortrat und oft in seiner Musik hörbar wird. Er wurde besonders von den ihm unterstehenden Hofmusikern der Esterházys geschätzt, da er eine herzliche Arbeitsatmosphäre pflegte und die Interessen der Musiker wirksam gegenüber ihrem Arbeitgeber vertrat. Haydn war frommer Katholik, der oft seinen Rosenkranz zur Hand nahm, wenn er bei einer Komposition festgefahren war, eine Gewohnheit, die er als hilfreich empfand. Wenn er eine Komposition beendet hatte, pflegte er „Laus deo“ (Ehre sei Gott) oder eine ähnliche Wendung an das Ende des Manuskripts zu schreiben. Zur Zerstreuung liebte er die Jagd und das Angeln. Haydn war von kleiner Statur. Er hatte die Pocken überlebt, und sein Gesicht war von den Narben dieser Krankheit übersät. Er sah nicht gut aus und war daher ziemlich überrascht, als die Frauen ihn während seines London-Besuchs umschwärmten. Die Porträtmaler, die Haydn während seiner Lebenszeit zeichneten oder malten, versuchten auf unterschiedliche Weise, seine attraktive Persönlichkeit statt seines unschönen Gesichts zum Ausdruck zu bringen; deshalb gleichen sich keine zwei der überlieferten Porträts. Haydn war auch ein Kunstliebhaber und hinterließ aus seiner Sammlung zahlreiche Kupferstiche, davon 140 aus seiner Londoner Zeit, überwiegend aus zeitgenössischer Kunst. |
G;|Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, auch „El Doctor“, „El Patrón“ oder „Don Pablo“ genannt, (* 1. Dezember 1949 in Rionegro; † 2. Dezember 1993 in Medellín) war ein kolumbianischer Drogenhändler. Durch groß angelegten und erstmals in der Kriminalgeschichte industrialisierten Drogenschmuggel wurde er zu einem der reichsten Menschen der Welt. Allgemein wird er als einer der mächtigsten und brutalsten Drogenhändler angesehen, die es je gegeben hat.  Jugend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria wurde in der Stadt Rionegro im Departamento de Antioquia als drittes von sieben Kindern des Viehzüchters Abel de Jesús Escobar und der Lehrerin Hermilda Gaviria geboren. Er entstammte dem ländlichen Mittelstand, seine Familie besaß Milchkühe und 12 Hektar Land. Die relativ wohlhabenden Rinderfarmen von Frontino und Rionegro waren stets Schauplätze gewalttätiger Auseinandersetzungen zwischen liberalen Heereseinheiten und Guerilleros aus den Bergen. Die Familie zog nach Envigado, dort gründete Hermilda eine Volksschule. Pablo Escobar schloss sich in Envigado einer nihilistischen Jugendbewegung, dem „Nadaismo“, an und begann bereits mit 13 Jahren kolumbianisches Marihuana zu rauchen. Seine Schule Liceo Lucrecio Jaramillo verließ er 1966 aus Protest vorzeitig. Escobar konsumierte große Mengen an Softdrinks, Pizza und Fastfood, was zu seinem Übergewicht führte. Zusammen mit seinem Cousin Gustavo Gaviria verbrachte er seine Jugend auf den Straßen und in den Bars des Medellíner Rotlichtbezirks Jesús el Nazareno. Im „Barrio Antioquia“ von Medellin machte er Bekanntschaft mit lokalen Unterweltgrößen, die für seine weitere Laufbahn wichtig waren. Der Besitz von Schusswaffen brachte ihm schnell den Respekt der anderen Banden ein, die damals meist nur mit Messern und Macheten bewaffnet waren. Früh schloss er sich einer Marihuana-Schmugglerbande an und beteiligte sich an Raubüberfällen auf der Straße. Ein weiterer Erwerbszweig war der Handel mit geschmuggelten Marlboro-Zigaretten. Nach Aussagen seiner Mutter war er für eine ehrliche Tätigkeit ungeeignet, denn er wollte sich schon früh große Macht aneignen. Mit 20 Jahren begann er Autos zu stehlen, um sie zerlegt als Hehlerware zu verkaufen. Kurze Zeit später entführte er mit seiner Bande reiche Bürger und ermordete sie oft auch trotz Lösegeldzahlung, um seine Macht zu demonstrieren. 1971 entführte er den beim Volk sehr unbeliebten Industriellen Diego Echavarría und erdrosselte ihn nach Erhalt des Lösegeldes. Die Entführung machte ihn in Medellin berühmt und brachte ihm den Beinamen „El Doctor“ ein. Mitte der 1970er-Jahre wurde der „Marimba“-Marihuanahandel durch die Modedroge Kokain abgelöst. Pioniere in diesem neuen Boom-Geschäft waren Escobar, die Ochoa-Brüder, Carlos Lehder und José Rodriguez Gacha. Escobar nutzte die ungeahnten Verdienstmöglichkeiten für seinen gesellschaftlichen Aufstieg. In den 1970er-Jahren baute er ein riesiges Drogenimperium auf. Während seiner besten Jahre soll er bis zu 1,5 Millionen US-Dollar am Tag verdient haben. Er war als der Drogenbaron Kolumbiens bekannt. Drogenhandel Escobar zeichnete sich durch Grausamkeit und Skrupellosigkeit aus, die ihn schnell an die Spitze des Medellín-Kartells brachten. Obwohl Escobar einmal im Besitz von elf Kilogramm Kokain festgenommen wurde, gab es nie einen Prozess wegen Drogenbesitzes oder Drogenhandels gegen ihn, da der ihn belastende Polizist unter ungeklärten Umständen ums Leben kam. Durch Morddrohungen wurden auch die Richter eingeschüchtert, die den Mordprozess daher nicht noch einmal aufrollten. 1975 lernte Escobar einen wohlhabenden Piloten mit dem Decknamen „Rubin“ aus Medellín kennen, der fließend Englisch sprach, Miami gut kannte und bereits für die Ochoa-Brüder (Alsonso, Jorge und Fabio) arbeitete. „Rubin“ kaufte in Miami Sportflugzeuge und warb weitere Piloten an. Der erste Kokainschmuggler aus Medellín war Fabio Restrepo, mit dem „Rubin“ 1975 ein bis zwei Lieferungen Kokain (40–60 kg) nach Miami ausflog und einen Gewinn von etwa 40.000 USD erwirtschaftete. Escobar erhielt von Jorge Ochoa die Erlaubnis, unverschnittenes Kokain an Restrepo zu verkaufen. Er ließ Restrepo ermorden und „Rubin“ sowie die Ochoa-Brüder wissen, dass sie fortan für ihn arbeiten. 1976 heiratete Escobar die 15-jährige María Victoria Henao Vellejo. Mit ihr bekam er die Kinder Juan Pablo und Manuela. Die Ehe wurde nach eigener Aussage als sehr glücklich eingeschätzt, obwohl Escobar seine Frau mit unzähligen jungen Frauen betrog. Wurde eine dieser Frauen schwanger, wurde sie von Escobars Auftragsmördern getötet. Jhon Jairo Velásquez, genannt „Popeye“, war engster Vertrauter und Chefkiller Escobars, er tötete auf seinen Befehl über 150 Menschen. Insgesamt ließ Escobar 30 Richter sowie 457 Polizisten töten. 1976 ließ das Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad (DAS) seinen Cousin Gustavo Gaviria verhaften, nachdem er in Miami Kokain abtransportiert hatte. Escobar wurde verhaftet und musste in Itagüí eine Gefängnisstrafe absitzen, wurde aber durch Bestechung kurz danach wieder freigelassen. Die DAS-Beamten, die ihn verhaftet hatten, wurden ermordet. Er etablierte damit das kolumbianische „plata o plomo“. Bedeutung: Silber oder Blei, Prinzip: Entweder lässt man sich bestechen, oder es fliegen Bleikugeln (für oder gegen ihn). Weiterhin schuf er folgendes Geschäftsprinzip: Kokain wurde von unabhängigen Pflanzern gewonnen, Escobar kontrollierte den Transport. Erzeuger zahlten dafür eine Provision von 10 Prozent auf den Großhandelspreis in Miami. Bei Verlust einer Lieferung zahlte Escobar den Lieferanten Ersatz auf den Erzeugerkostenpreis. Die Gewinne lagen bei weitem über den Verlusten der abgefangenen Lieferungen. Escobar erkaufte sich Schutz von den Pflanzern über die Verarbeiter bis zu den Distributeuren. Die Transporte wurden hauptsächlich mit Staffeln von Sportflugzeugen (etwa eine Tonne Fracht) abgewickelt, aber auch mit ferngesteuerten Mini-U-Booten, die bis zwei Tonnen Kokain von der Nordküste Kolumbiens bis nach Puerto Rico transportierten. In der Endphase ließ er 10 Tonnen Kokain in einer umgebauten Boeing 727 in die USA exportieren. Gacha und Lehder arbeiteten in der Anfangsphase teils für Escobar, teils gegen ihn. 1975 wurde eine Kokainlieferung von 600 Kilogramm in einem Flugzeug in Cali abgefangen; diese Maßnahme löste die Ermordung von 40 Personen an einem Wochenende aus, da sich die Organisationen gegenseitig vorwarfen, das Geschäft gestört zu haben. Der unermessliche Reichtum durch das Kokaingeschäft führte zu einer neuen Gesellschaftsschicht in Kolumbien, die diesen durch Villen, Diskotheken etc. zur Schau trug. Escobars Schwager Mario Henao, ein linksorientierter Intellektueller, verschaffte Escobar die patriotische Rechtfertigung für seinen Drogenhandel, um ein neues, modernes und fortschrittliches Kolumbien aufzubauen. In Medellín gab Escobar die Zeitung Medellín Cívico heraus, die sich mit der Glorifizierung seiner Person befasste. Ihm zur Ehre wurde das Viertel Pablo Escobar für Wohnungslose erbaut. Escobar stellte sich als großzügiger Arbeitgeber in Medellín dar und zahlte dem Personal in den Drogenlabors hohe Gehälter. 1978 wurde Escobar als Abgeordneter in den Stadtrat von Medellín gewählt, die politische Immunität schützte ihn vor weiterer Strafverfolgung. Der Diplomatenstatus wurde für Reisen seiner Familie nach Miami genutzt. In Miami erwarb die Familie ebenfalls Luxusvillen und eine 8-Millionen-Dollar-Ranch bei Plantation im Broward County. Die kolumbianischen Narco-Millionäre und -Milliardäre setzten die Tradition der Wohlhabenden fort, die ihre Reichtümer damals der Sklavenarbeit, dem Tabak- und Chinin-Schmuggel, der Landbeschlagnahmung während der Bürgerkriege, dem Gold- und Smaragdschmuggel verdankten. 1981 stellte Escobar nach der Entführung von Marta Ochoa eine private MAS-Miliz „Muerte a los Secuestradores“ auf. Die Gründung der MAS-Miliz wurde von 223 Drogenhändlern unterzeichnet und durch das Abwerfen von Flugblättern über einem Fußballstadion bekanntgegeben. Der Zusammenschluss der MAS wird auch als Gründungsdatum des Medellín-Kartells gesehen. 1982 ließ sich Escobar als Abgeordneter in den kolumbianischen Kongress wählen. Er war Vertreter der liberalen Partei, befand sich auf dem Gipfel seiner Popularität und wurde „paisa Robin Hood“ genannt. Da er aber öffentlich beschuldigt wurde, mit Drogen zu handeln, war er gezwungen, sein Mandat niederzulegen. Aufgrund seiner Finanzmacht und seiner Verbindungen konnte er sich weiterhin großen Einfluss auf Politik und (bestochene) Politiker sichern. 1983 und Anfang 1984 war er der erfolgreichste Kokainhändler der Welt, er hatte große Teile des Kokainmarktes unter Kontrolle (80 Prozent in Kolumbien). Seinen größten Gewinn erzielte er mit dem Kokainschmuggel in die USA, wo Kokain etwa dreimal teurer verkauft werden konnte als in Kolumbien. Ein Kilogramm Kokain, sobald es über der Grenze war, hatte statt seines ursprünglichen Wertes von 9.000 Dollar nun einen von 30.000 Dollar. Da sein Reinheitsgrad von ursprünglich 90 Prozent in den USA auf 30 Prozent gestreckt wurde, stieg der Wert auf über 90.000 Dollar. 1983 bot Manuel Noriega dem Medellín-Kartell Exil und großzügige Anlagemöglichkeiten für das Drogengeld. Nachdem die Auseinandersetzung mit Strafverfolgungsbehörden in Kolumbien 1984 im Nachgang zu der Zerstörung von Escobars Haupt-Drogenlaboren Tranquilandia und Vila Coca durch Beamte des kolumbianischen Justizministeriums mit Unterstützung der US-amerikanischen Drogenfahndung DEA und der nachfolgenden Ermordung des kolumbianischen Justizministers Rodrigo Lara Bonillas am 30. April 1984 auf Veranlassung von Escobar eskalierte, flohen Escobar, Lehder, Gacha und die Ochoa-Brüder nach Panama. Bei der Vernichtung von Tranquilandia und Vila Coca wurden 14 Tonnen reines Kokain beschlagnahmt, das bedeutete eine schwere Einbuße für das Medellín-Kartell. Die US-Luftwaffe versprühte Herbizide auf Kokainpflanzungen in den Regenwäldern Kolumbiens. Aus dieser Zeit stammt sein Zitat: „Lieber ein Grab in Kolumbien als eine Gefängniszelle in den Vereinigten Staaten.“ 1985 begannen Gacha und Escobar mit der „Säuberung“ des Mittleren Magdalenatals von der FARC-Guerilla. Den Operationen, die durch britische und israelische Söldner unterstützt wurden, fielen tausende von Bauern und Feldarbeitern zum Opfer. Paramilitärische Verbände des Medellínkartells und Heereseinheiten fügten der FARC, ELN und M-19 im Magdalenatal schwere Verluste zu. Im gleichen Jahr stürmte die linksgerichtete Untergrundorganisation M-19 (Movimiento 19 de Abril) den Justizpalast von Bogotá, Escobars Beteiligung blieb unklar. 1986 starb der US-Basketballstar Len Bias nach einer Kokainüberdosis, das öffentliche Bewusstsein wendete sich gegen die Partydroge, und sie wurde geächtet. Escobar – zuvor als Inbegriff des Zeitgeistes wahrgenommen –, wurde von der Weltöffentlichkeit zum Schwerkriminellen erklärt. 1988 wurde George Bush Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten und investierte einen Milliarden-Etat in den Kampf gegen den kolumbianischen Drogenhandel. 1989 war Escobar laut Forbes Magazine mit einem Privatvermögen von 2,7 Milliarden USD der siebtreichste Mann der Welt und kontrollierte 80 Prozent des internationalen Kokainmarktes. Escobar war auch sozial engagiert: Er finanzierte Krankenhäuser, Sozialwohnungen und Schulen und genoss daher unter dem ärmsten Teil der Bevölkerung seiner Heimatstadt Medellín zum Teil sogar einen guten Ruf. Das Fußballstadion seines Heimatvereins in Envigado wurde mit seinen Geldern erbaut. Escobar gründete in Medellín Büro- und Apartmentkomplexe, Diskotheken und zahlreiche Restaurants, noch heute sind seine Spuren sichtbar. Hacienda Nápoles 1979 kaufte Escobar für 63 Millionen USD eine 3.000 Hektar große Ranch bei Puerto Triunfo am Río Magdalena und machte daraus einen luxuriösen Landsitz. Der Besitz umfasste einen Flugplatz, einen Hubschrauberlandeplatz, eine Stierkampfarena, sechs Swimmingpools, ein gynäkologisches Untersuchungszimmer, künstliche Seen für Wasserski und ein komplettes Straßennetz. Für seinen Zoo auf der Hacienda ließ Escobar Elefanten, Büffel, Löwen, Nashörner, Gazellen, Zebras, Flusspferde, Kamele und Strauße einfliegen. Für seinen Sohn ließ er Dinosaurierfiguren errichten. Die Hacienda Nápoles hatte komfortable Schlafgelegenheiten für über 100 Personen. Der Eingang war mit dem Sportflugzeug geschmückt, mit dem Escobar seine ersten Kokaintransporte nach Medellín abwickelte. Für die Unterhaltung seiner Freunde ließ er kolumbianische Schönheitsköniginnen auftreten, welche Striptease vorführten, bei Wettspielen teure Sportwagen gewinnen konnten, sich aber auch Demütigungen wie einer kompletten Haarrasur, Insekten schlucken oder nackt um die Wette auf Bäume klettern, aussetzen mussten. Auf der Hacienda fanden auch zahlreiche Hinrichtungen statt. Ein Arbeiter, der Escobar bestahl, wurde an Händen und Füßen gefesselt und zur Unterhaltung der Gäste in einem der Swimmingpools ertränkt. Der Architekt, dem ein Baufehler und der Einsturz des ersten Stocks in der Villa vorgeworfen wurde, wurde erschossen. Nachdem 2007 Räuber nach legendären Reichtümern suchten und plünderten, wurde aus der verfallenen Villa ein Freizeitpark „Parque Temático Hacienda Nápoles“. Die von Escobar ausgesetzten Flusspferde fühlen sich im tropischen Regenwaldklima von Kolumbien wohl und vermehren sich stark. Virginia Vallejo Virginia Vallejo, TV-Journalistin und Moderatorin, war Geliebte von Pablo Escobar von 1983 bis 1987. Sie veröffentlichte 2007 „Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar“ (deutsch: Pablo lieben, Escobar hassen), worin sie Escobar mit Politikern wie Alberto Santofimio und Präsidenten Alfonso López Michelsen, Ernesto Samper und Álvaro Uribe Vélez in Verbindung bringt und einen Politskandal in Kolumbien auslöste. Verfolgung und Tod Im Widerstand gegen ein von der kolumbianischen Regierung beabsichtigtes Gesetz zur Auslieferung von Drogenhändlern an die USA führte Escobar an der Spitze der Extraditables („die Auslieferbaren“) einen regelrechten Krieg gegen den Staat. Er ließ Hunderte von Polizisten, Richtern und Staatsanwälten ermorden und überzog die Hauptstadt Bogotá mit Bombenterror. Ein besonders spektakuläres Bombenattentat legte den Sitz der Tageszeitung El Espectador in Bogotá in Trümmer. Zahlreiche Entführungen von Angehörigen des öffentlichen Lebens in Kolumbien, häufig mit tödlichem Ausgang, gingen auf Escobars Konto. Für seinen eigenen Schutz engagierte er Leibwächter und unterhielt eine große Zahl von Sicarios (Auftragskillern). Die besonders entschiedene Feindschaft der kolumbianischen Polizei erwarb sich Escobar durch ein Kopfgeld von 500 bis 1000 Dollar, das er für jeden getöteten Polizisten in Medellín aussetzte. Die Verfolgung Escobars durch den Staat Kolumbien wurde weiter intensiviert, nachdem 1989 der Präsidentschaftskandidat der liberalen Partei, Luis Carlos Galán, der für den Fall seiner Wahl eine verstärkte Offensive gegen die Drogenmafia angekündigt hatte, während einer Wahlveranstaltung in Soacha, einem Vorort von Bogotá, ermordet worden war. Nach Friedensverhandlungen erklärte Escobar 1991 schließlich einen Waffenstillstand und stellte sich der Polizei, nachdem ihm zugesichert worden war, nicht an die USA ausgeliefert zu werden. Mit seiner Leibwache kam er, wie bei den Verhandlungen ausgemacht, in das von ihm selbst errichtete luxuriöse Gefängnis La Catedral in der Nähe seines Heimatortes Envigado. Nach mehreren Skandalen (unter anderem ließ Escobar Drogenhändler ins Gefängnis kommen und dort ermorden) wollte ihn die Regierung in ein anderes Gefängnis verlegen, woraufhin er die Flucht ergriff. Jedoch wandten sich nun auch Teile der Unterwelt gegen ihn: Das Cali-Kartell finanzierte zusammen mit Angehörigen von Escobar Ermordeten die Los Pepes, eine paramilitärische Todesschwadron, die u. a. auch von den rechtsgerichteten Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia-Milizen unterstützt wurden. Die Los Pepes, teilweise wohl auch staatlicherweise unterstützt, führten daraufhin einen Privatkrieg gegen Escobar und töteten dessen Sicarios und zerstörten dessen Laboratorien. Dadurch verlor Escobar zunehmend das Geld um seine Männer zu bezahlen und damit eine Bedrohung darzustellen. Außerdem konnte so das Cali-Kartell Escobars Platz als Drogenlieferant in den USA übernehmen. Tatsächlich stieg der Drogenimport in die USA in den letzten Monaten Escobars an, obwohl Escobar zunehmend aus dem Geschäft gedrängt wurde. Escobar starb schließlich, als eine US-amerikanisch-kolumbianische Elite-Einheit ihn 16 Monate später bei einer Razzia in Medellín erschoss: Er hatte aus seinem Versteck heraus mit seinem Sohn telefoniert, wobei die Ermittler den Anruf zurückverfolgen konnten. An seiner Beerdigung nahmen über 20.000 Menschen teil. |
G;|Wilhelm-Emanuel Wilderich Maria Hubertus Vitus Aloysius Freiherr von Ketteler (* 15. Juni 1906 in Eringerfeld; † März 1938 in Wien) war ein deutscher Diplomat. Ketteler wurde vor allem bekannt als jungkonservativer Gegner des Nationalsozialismus im „Edgar-Jung-Kreis“ und enger Mitarbeiter von Hitlers Vizekanzler und Botschafter in Wien, Franz von Papen.  Jugend und Studium (1906 bis 1932) Ketteler war ein Spross der westfälischen Adelsfamilie Ketteler. Er wurde als drittes von neun Kindern von Clemens Goswin Freiherrn von Ketteler (* 17. September 1870 in Schwarzenraben; † 7. Januar 1945 in Störmede) und seiner Ehefrau Maria Elisabeth Freiin von Fürstenberg (* 7. September 1875 in Schloss Körtlinghausen; † 21. Mai 1963 in Störmede) auf dem Schloss Eringerfeld geboren. Zu seinen weiteren Verwandten zählte der Diplomat Klemens von Ketteler, der im Juni 1900 in Peking ermordet wurde, die Bischöfe Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler und Clemens August Graf von Galen sowie Philipp Freiherr von Boeselager. Ketteler besuchte das Gymnasium Marianum Warburg. Während seines Studiums in München wurde er aktives Mitglied der katholischen Studentenverbindung Rheno-Bavaria im KV. In der Weimarer Republik gehörte Ketteler zur „Gruppe“ der sogenannten „Jungkonservativen“. Dieser etwas ungenaue Begriff subsumiert eine diffuse Menge rechtsstehender, häufig in keiner Beziehung zueinander stehender, jüngerer Intellektueller, die eine mehr oder weniger umfassende Restauration des „alten“ Deutschen Reiches anstrebten. Gemeinsam waren den Jungkonservativen die Ablehnung von Demokratie, Liberalismus und Parlamentarismus in der Weimarer Form sowie ein eher „elitäres“ Selbstverständnis. Insbesondere in letzterer Hinsicht grenzten sie sich in krasser Form von dem, als „plebejisch“ empfundenen, populistischen Massenkult der Nationalsozialisten ab. Ketteler, der seinem Freund Fritz Günther von Tschirschky zufolge ein „ungewöhnlich starkes Interesse für die Politik“ besaß und ein „gläubiger Katholik ohne konfessionelle Engstirnigkeit“ war, stand bereits in den 1920er Jahren in freundschaftlicher Verbindung zu der westfälischen Gutsbesitzerfamilie von Papen (Adelsgeschlecht). Während der Kanzlerschaft von Franz von Papen, dem Oberhaupt der Familie, vom Juni bis Dezember 1932 kam Ketteler erstmals in engeren Kontakt mit den Schaltstellen der Politik in Berlin. Tätigkeit in der Reichsvizekanzlei (1933 bis 1934) Nach der Bildung der Regierung der „Nationalen Konzentration“ im Januar 1933, in der sich beinahe alle rechts stehenden politischen Kräfte in Deutschland zu einer Koalitionsregierung mit Adolf Hitler an der Spitze als Kanzler zusammentaten, wurde Ketteler als Mitarbeiter in das Büro von Papens berufen, der in der neuen Regierung als stellvertretender Reichskanzler Hitlers amtierte. Gemeinsam mit anderen jungkonservativen Mitarbeitern Papens wie Herbert von Bose, Edgar Jung, Friedrich-Carl von Savigny, Kurt Josten, Walter Hummelsheim und Fritz Günther von Tschirschky arbeitete Ketteler von dieser Stelle aus an einem Umbau des Weimarer Staates im Sinne der jungkonservativen Ideen. Die als Röhm-Putsch bekannt gewordene politische Säuberungsaktion der Nationalsozialisten im Juni und Juli 1934, in deren Zuge Jung und Bose ermordet wurden, überlebte Ketteler durch Glück: Gemeinsam mit Josten gelang es ihm, die Räumlichkeiten der Vizekanzlei nach deren Besetzung durch die SS zu verlassen, weil die SS-Leute die beiden irrtümlich für Besucher hielten. Wenige Stunden nach seiner geglückten Flucht aus der Vizekanzlei reiste Ketteler nach Gut Neudeck in Ostpreußen, dem Landsitz des Reichspräsidenten. Seine Absicht, Hindenburg über die Lage in Berlin zu informieren und ihn in seiner Eigenschaft als Oberkommandierenden der Reichswehr zu einem Eingreifen gegen das in der Hauptstadt ablaufende Mordgeschehen veranlassen zu können, zerschlug sich jedoch, da man ihn nicht in die Nähe des Staatsoberhauptes vorließ. Auch der Versuch, mit Hilfe von Hindenburgs Gutsnachbarn Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau zu ihm zu kommen, führte nicht zum erhofften Ergebnis. Attaché an der deutschen Gesandtschaft in Wien (1934 bis 1938) Im August 1934 ging Ketteler gemeinsam mit von Papen, der – inzwischen vom Amt des Vizekanzlers zurückgetreten – zum deutschen Sonderbotschafter in Österreich ernannt worden war, nach Wien. Vom Frühherbst 1934 bis zu seiner Ermordung im Frühling 1938 wirkte Ketteler dort als einer von Papens engsten Mitarbeitern. Über den offiziellen Rang, den er dort bekleidete, herrscht – zumindest terminologisch – eine gewisse Verwirrung: Einige Quellen nennen ihn einen „außerordentlichen Attaché“, andere den „persönlichen Sekretär“ oder den „persönlichen Assistenten“ Papens. Im Februar verbrachten Ketteler und sein Kollege Hans von Kageneck in Papens Auftrag die Diplomatenakten, die dessen Tätigkeit in Wien dokumentierten, zur Aufbewahrung an einen sicheren Ort in der Schweiz. Nach seiner Rückkehr nach Wien begann Ketteler mit den Vorbereitungen für ein Attentat auf Adolf Hitler. Wie weit die Vorbereitungen für dieses zum Zeitpunkt seines Todes gediehen waren bleibt unklar. Allem Anschein nach plante Ketteler jedoch, Hitler bei seinem feierlichen Einzug in Wien von einem Fenster der deutschen Botschaft aus während der Fahrt des Diktators (der bei solchen Anlässen im Auto, ähnlich einem römischen Feldherren bei einem Triumphzug, zu stehen pflegte) zu erschießen. Einen Tag nach dem deutschen Einmarsch in Österreich im März 1938 verschwand Ketteler zunächst spurlos. Seit dem 12. März 1938 gilt er als vermisst. Papen gab während der Nürnberger Prozesse zu Protokoll, er habe daraufhin sofort die Wiener Polizei verständigt und Reinhard Heydrich gebeten, aufklären zu lassen, „ob Herr von Ketteler nicht etwa versehentlich verhaftet wurde“. Einem Vermerk vom 5. April 1938 ist zudem zu entnehmen, dass Papen auch Hitler kurz „über die Sache“ unterrichtete. Ferner verständigte er Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Göring und den Staatssekretär für das Sicherheitswesen in Österreich, Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Himmler gab am 25. März einen Erlass heraus, in dem es hieß: „Mit sofortiger Wirkung weise ich den Chef der Ordnungspolizei und den Chef der Sicherheitspolizei an, eine besonders sorgfältige und umfassende Fahndung nach dem seit Sonntag, den 13. März vermissten Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherrn von Ketteler einzuleiten. Ich ersuche, dass die nachgeordneten Dienststellen mit besonderen Nachdruck auf das vorliegende Fahndungsersuchen hingewiesen werden ...“ Am 25. April 1938 barg der Oberstrommeister Karl Franz in der Donau bei Hainburg, fünfzig Kilometer stromabwärts von Wien, eine unbekannte männliche Leiche. Die Leiche konnte aufgrund eines goldenden Siegelrings mit Familienwappen und „eines goldenen Rings mit caluschonartig geschliffenem blauen Saphir mit 2 Brillanten, innen graviert: 30.VI. 1934“ binnen kurzer Zeit als der verschwundene Ketteler identifiziert werden. Als Todesursache wurde Ertrinken festgestellt. Da man im Leichnam des Toten Chloroform fand, das derart stark war, dass es aufgrund seiner schnellen Wirkungsweise einen „selbständigen“ Gang in die Donau unmöglich gemacht hätte, schied Suizid als Todesursache aus, so dass man auf „Mord“ erkennen musste. Am wahrscheinlichsten gilt die Variante, dass Ketteler erst betäubt und dann in seiner Badewanne ertränkt wurde. Die Leiche soll demnach dann in der Donau „abgeladen“ worden sein, um den Mord als Suizid zu tarnen. Die Täterschaft wurde von Zeitzeugen und ausländischen Journalisten sofort unbekannten Angehörigen der Gestapo (oder der SS bzw. des SD) zugeschrieben. Diesem Urteil hat sich auch die historische Forschung angeschlossen (siehe unten). Papen erstattete, nach eigener Aussage, nach dem Fund von Kettelers Leiche Anzeige gegen Unbekannt. Außerdem protestierte er in einem Brief an Hitler – der ebenso wie die Bitte um Hilfe bei der Suche nach den Mördern unbeantwortet blieb – gegen Kettelers Ermordung und setzte eine Belohnung von 20.000 Reichsmark für die Ergreifung der Täter aus. Als Motiv für die Tat wollte Papen „Rache der Gestapo gegen mich, meine Politik und meine Freunde“ erblicken. Ein Hilfegesuch an Göring, das Papen gemacht haben will, habe dieser mit der Zusage beantwortet, sich bei Hitler für eine Bestrafung der Verantwortlichen einzusetzen. Zuvor habe Göring ihm jedoch mitgeteilt, dass die Gestapo Beweise gefunden habe, dass Ketteler einen Anschlag auf Hitlers Leben vorbereitet habe. Unmittelbar nach der ersten Obduktion am 27. April 1938 wurde Kettelers Leichnam, ohne Benachrichtigung seiner Angehörigen auf dem städtischen Friedhof von Hainburg in der Grabstätte D 17, Nr. 14, beigesetzt. Einige Wochen später ordnete die Wiener Staatsanwaltschaft auf Anregung der Gestapo, die anscheinend befürchtete, dass die voreilige Beisetzung die Gerüchte um den Tod von Kettelers verstärken musste, die Exhumierung des Toten an, „um eine zweifelsfrei Agnoszierung der Leiche und die Feststellung der Todesursache zu ermöglichen“. Die Exhumierung erfolgte schließlich am 25. Mai 1938 in Anwesenheit von Kettelers Bruder Goswin Freiherr von Ketteler und des Wiener Zahnarztes Dr. Rudolf Friese. Nach einer erneuten Untersuchung der Leiche durch den Leichenbeschauer Professor Dr. Werkgartner wurde der Tote auf den Familienbesitz derer von Ketteler nach Geseke überführt, wo man ihn am 31. Mai 1938 zum zweiten Mal beisetzte. Anzumerken ist dass die Lokalzeitung "Niederösterreichischer Grenzbote" in ihrer Ausgabe vom 22. Mai 1938 folgende Feststellung auf S. 3 brachte: Feststellung: Die Wiener Polizei hat nach umfassenden Ermittlungen nunmehr festgestellt, daß es sich bei der vor kurzem in Hainburg von der Donau ans Land gespülten Leiche um die des vermißt gemeldeten Wilhelm Emanuel Freiherr von Ketteler aus Wien handelt. Der Mordfall Ketteler Über den Zeitpunkt und die genauen Umstände von Kettelers Tod besteht in der Forschung Uneinigkeit. Übereinstimmung herrscht in der relevanten Literatur lediglich darüber, dass die Täter in den Reihen des SD zu suchen seien. Das „Handbuch des Österreichers“ von 1949 gab noch an, Ketteler sei bei dem Versuch, mit dem Auto nach Ungarn zu fliehen, aufgegriffen und dann ermordet worden. Die meisten anderen Bücher, die den „Fall Ketteler“ behandeln, begnügen sich mit der kurzen Feststellung, dass Ketteler nach dem deutschen Einmarsch in Österreich zunächst „spurlos“ verschwunden und seine Leiche einige Wochen später aufgetaucht sei. Über Funddatum und -ort kursieren dabei vielfältige, z. T. widersprüchliche Angaben. Eine englischsprachige Papen-Biografie von 1941 spricht davon, dass Kettelers „fürchterlich entstellter Körper“ (horribly mutilated corpse) bereits Ende April (sic!) von der Donau an Land gespült worden sei. Außerdem will dieses Buch wissen, dass Ketteler „nach schrecklichen Foltern ermordet“ worden sei (murdered after horrible tortures). Ein genauer Fundort wird hier nicht genannt. Eine andere Papen-Biografie aus dem Jahr 1940 datiert die Auffindung von Kettelers Leichnam auf den 16. Mai und nennt die Gegend bei Hainburg als Stelle, an der dieser geborgen worden sei (recovered from the Danube near Hainburg). Dieses Werk vermerkt außerdem, dass Ketteler „chloroformiert“ worden sei (also noch gelebt habe), als man ihn in die Donau warf. Papen selbst sagte am 18. Juni 1946 in Nürnberg aus, dass eine in seinem Auftrag durchgeführte Obduktion Kettelers keinen Beweis eines gewaltsamen Todes erbracht hätte und widerspricht (indirekt) damit der zitierten Angabe Koeves, dass Kettelers Körper „fürchterlich verstümmelt“ gewesen sei. Fabian von Schlabrendorff bestätigt in einem Erinnerungsbuch von 1951 Papens Aussage, wenn er schreibt, die Leiche habe „keine äußeren Verletzungen“ aufgewiesen. Außerdem nennt er wie Dutch Hainburg als Fundort der Leiche. Verwirrenderweise datiert er den Auffindezeitpunkt wie Koeves, und anders als Dutch, auf „Ende April“. Thompson nennt – als einzige Autorin – den Wienerwald als Fundort von Kettelers sterblichen Überresten. Der genaue Zeitpunkt von Kettelers Ermordung ist ebenso strittig: Arthur Schweitzer behauptet, diese sei am 13. März erfolgt. Es scheint allerdings so, als ob er in fahrlässiger Weise den Tag von Kettelers Verschwinden nach dem deutschen Einmarsch einfach mit dem Tag seiner Ermordung gleichgesetzt hat, ohne zu bedenken, dass die Ermordung Kettelers auch deutlich später, zu praktisch jedem beliebigen Zeitpunkt zwischen seinem Verschwinden und dem Fund seiner Leiche, erfolgt sein kann. Kettelers Vetter Philipp Freiherr von Boeselager erklärte in einem Vortrag am 14. Juli 2004 im Bayerischen Landtag, Ketteler sei von der Gestapo in seiner Badewanne ertränkt und danach in die Donau geworfen worden, um einen Selbstmord vorzutäuschen. Er berief sich dabei darauf, dass diese Umstände bald allgemein „ruchbar“ geworden seien, da ein SD-Mann in „besoffenen Zustand sich einem anderen gegenüber gerühmt hatte“: „Wenn du nicht brav bist, ertrinkst auch du in der Badewanne wie dein Freund Ketteler.“ Kettelers Freund und Kollege in der Vizekanzlei von Tschirschky bestätigte 1972 in seinen Memoiren die Variante des „Ertränkens“ durch die Gestapo und gibt an, diese Information nach 1945 von den gemeinsamen ehemaligen Kollegen Josten und Kageneck im Spruchkammerverfahren gegen von Papen erfahren zu haben. Außerdem nennt Tschirschky einen Journalisten und Mitarbeiter der Vizekanzlei namens Walter Bochow – den der verdächtigt ein Mitarbeiter der Gestapo gewesen zu sein – als Mörder Kettelers: Daran dass Bochow, der ihn, Ketteler und ihre Kollegen bereits in der Kanzleizeit ausspioniert habe, Ketteler „auf dem Gewissen“ habe, bestehe für ihn, Tschirschky, „kein Zweifel“. 1970 wurde der Fall Ketteler auf Ersuchen des Wolfgang Freiherrn von Fürstenberg aus Detmold, einem Mitschüler und Cousin Wilhelm von Kettelers, durch die Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltung der Länder in Ludwigsburg zur Untersuchung angenommen und zur Durchführung der Untersuchung an die Staatsanwaltschaft in Braunschweig delegiert. Im Zuge der Untersuchung wurden ehemalige Kollegen und Freunde Kettelers sowie SD-Mitarbeiter vernommen und Indizien gesammelt. Das Verfahren konnte schließlich – nach einer vorübergehenden Einstellung in den 1980er Jahren – 1994 auf Anregung des Historikers Lutz Hachmeister durch die Staatsanwaltschaft Braunschweig zu einem erfolgreichen Abschluss gebracht werden: Gestützt auf neu aufgefundene Dokumente des SD kamen die Braunschweiger Ermittler zu dem Ergebnis, dass Ketteler mit an Sicherheit grenzender Wahrscheinlichkeit am 12. März vom SD auf dem Weg von der Wohnung seiner Sekretärin zur Botschaft abgefangen und verschleppt worden sei und dass er nach kurzen Verhören, in denen er sich weigerte ein Arrangement mit dem SD einzugehen, am 12. oder 13. März 1938 von dem SD-Mann Horst Böhme (und unidentifizierten Helfershelfern) in seiner Badewanne ertränkt und anschließend in die Donau geworfen wurde. Den Befehl zur Ermordung Kettelers hatte Böhme durch den SD-Chef Heydrich erhalten, nachdem Bochow, der – zu dieser Zeit Journalist für die Daily Mail in Wien – als freier Nachrichtenmann für Ketteler tätig war, Heydrich über Kettelers jüngste regimefeindliche Aktivitäten informiert hatte. Hachmeister ergänzt die kriminalistischen Befunde durch die Schlussfolgerung, dass Ketteler wahrscheinlich nach seiner Hindenburg-Aktion von 1934 ins Augenmerk des SD geraten sei. Nachdem er somit bereits grundsätzlich als persona non grata galt, habe seine Reise in die Schweiz im Februar einen frischen Anlass für seine Ermordung gegeben, wozu die Situation des Anschlusses Gelegenheit geboten habe: Der SD habe befürchten müssen, dass sich unter den in der Schweiz von Ketteler deponierten Papen-Dokumenten auch ein in Papens Besitz vermutetes Testament des verstorbenen Reichspräsidenten Hindenburg befinden könnte, das eine andere Persönlichkeit als Hitler als seinen Nachfolger im Amt des Reichspräsidenten empfehlen würde. Als Hauptverantwortliche für den Mord wurden Böhme (als Durchführender) und Heydrich (als Auftraggeber) genannt. |
G;|Oswald Pirow (* 14. August 1890 in Aberdeen, Kapkolonie; † 11. Oktober 1959 in Pretoria) war ein südafrikanischer Rechtsanwalt und rechtsextremistischer Politiker. Pirow bezeichnete sich selbst als Nationalsozialisten, vertrat einen radikalen Antikommunismus, Rassismus und Antisemitismus und sprach sich für die Errichtung eines autoritären Führerstaats aus. Er war von 1929 bis 1933 Justizminister, von 1933 bis 1939 Verteidigungsminister und von 1933 bis 1938 auch Verkehrsminister Südafrikas. 1940 gründete er die nationalsozialistisch orientierte politische Fraktion Nuwe Orde (‚Neue Ordnung‘). Nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs suchte er Kontakt zu rechtsextremistischen Gruppierungen. Von 1958 bis zu seinem Tod fungierte er als Ankläger im Treason Trial, in welchem unter anderem Nelson Mandela des Hochverrats angeklagt wurde.  Werdegang Pirow war der Enkel eines deutschen Missionars. Sein Bruder Hans Pirow machte Karriere als Staatsbergbau-Ingenieur und seine Schwester Sylva Moerdyk wurde eine einflussreiche Politikerin. Oswald Pirow wuchs in der Provinz Transvaal auf, besuchte das Realgymnasium in Itzehoe und studierte in Kiel und London Rechtswissenschaften. Er wurde 1913 als Anwalt zugelassen und praktizierte in Pretoria. Hier wurde er Partner des Politikers Tielman Roos und trat dessen National Party bei. Gemeinsam arbeiteten sie an der Beendigung des Bergarbeiterstreiks am Witwatersrand 1922. Politische Karriere 1924 wurde Pirow erstmals ins südafrikanische Parlament gewählt. Nach dem Gewinn der Parlamentswahlen durch die National Party unter James Barry Munnick Hertzog 1929 wurde Pirow als Nachfolger von Roos zum Justizminister ernannt. Roos hatte sich aus gesundheitlichen Gründen zur Behandlung nach Europa begeben, und Pirow übernahm auch dessen Parteiklientel im Transvaal. Pirows Politik wurde von seinem radikalen Rassismus und Antikommunismus bestimmt. Bereits während der Wahlen 1929 hatte er den „weißen Terror“ (“white terror”) organisiert. Als es im selben Jahr insbesondere in Durban zu verschiedenen Protestkampagnen kam, die sich etwa gegen die Kopfsteuern richteten, durch die Schwarze zur Arbeit für Weiße gezwungen werden sollten, oder gegen das Verbot des Bierbrauens – die Schwarzen sollten zum Besuch der städtischen Bierhallen gezwungen werden – reagierte Pirow mit Terror. Er flog in einer aufsehenerregenden Aktion von Pretoria nach Durban, wo er in den frühen Morgenstunden des 14. November persönlich einen Angriff der Polizei auf drei schwarze Wohnviertel leitete. Bei dieser Razzia, bei der es offiziell um die Eintreibung von Steuern ging, wurden knapp 700 unter anderem mit Maschinengewehren schwer bewaffnete Polizisten und Tränengas eingesetzt. 8.000 Schwarze wurden festgenommen und durchsucht. 500 angebliche Steuerhinterzieher wurden vor Sondergerichten angeklagt, die bei einem Schuldspruch zur Zahlung der Steuer oder einem Monat Gefängnis verurteilten. Wie Kritiker anmerkten, war dies das erste Mal, dass in Südafrika Tränengas gegen friedliche Zivilisten eingesetzt wurde, die keinen Widerstand leisteten. 1929 legte Pirow außerdem ein Gesetz vor, das drastische Maßnahmen gegen angebliche „Faulheit“ schwarzer Farmarbeiter vorsah. 1930 setzte er mit dem Verweis auf eine angebliche kommunistische Verschwörung das zweite Ergänzungsgesetz (Riotous Assemblies Amendment Act, Act No. 19 / 1930) zum Rioutous Assemblies Act aus dem Jahre 1912 durch, die ihn als Justizminister mit weitreichenden Vollmachten auf Kosten der Rechtsstaatlichkeit ausstatteten. Er nutzte diese Vollmachten zu einem rabiaten Vorgehen gegen schwarze Gewerkschafter und ehemalige Kommunisten. 1933 gehörte Pirow zu den treibenden Kräften der Koalitionsbildung zwischen der National Party unter Hertzog und der South African Party unter Jan Smuts, bzw. der 1934 erfolgenden Vereinigung der Parteien zur United Party. Er übernahm in dem neuen Kabinett 1933 das Verteidigungsministerium und war zugleich Verkehrsminister. 1934 legte Pirow einen Fünf-Jahres-Plan zum Ausbau der südafrikanischen Verteidigung vor. In seiner Funktion als Verkehrsminister betrieb er die Gründung der Fluglinie South African Airways (SAA). Im Sinne der eigenen Machtansprüche auf dem Kontinent vergrößerte er damit den südafrikanischen Einfluss und die wirtschaftliche Unabhängigkeit von Großbritannien. Bis 1939 verdrängte die SAA mit ihren modernen Junkers-Flugzeugen die konkurrierende Imperial Airways aus dem südlichen Afrika. Pirow, der für eine strikte territoriale Trennung von Weißen und Schwarzen in Afrika eintrat, sah in den afrikanischen Hochländern des Südens und Ostens Siedlungsgebiete der Weißen und wollte sie unter südafrikanischen Einfluss bringen. Ein Zusammenrücken der Weißen sei auf Grund der Bedrohung durch kommunistische Agitation und asiatische Einflüsse notwendig. Pirows Idee eines „Greater South Africa“ (Groß-Südafrika) sah dabei südafrikanischen Einfluss bis nach Kenia und Uganda vor. Die „Rassenfrage“ wollte er durch die allgemeine Durchsetzung der Politik der Rassentrennung lösen. Er begründete dies mit der angeblichen kommunistischen Gefahr, vor der sich alle Weißen schützen müssten, und hielt auch einen kommunistisch inspirierten Angriff der Schwarzen für möglich. Dass Pirow während des Copperbelt-Streiks Mitte 1935 ein Fluggeschwader mit Tränengasbomben nach Nordrhodesien schickte, wurde als praktische Umsetzung diese Prinzipien gesehen. Legitimiert wurde der Einsatz damit, dass Südafrika ein Recht habe, überall dort einzugreifen, wo Leben und Autorität der Weißen auf dem Spiel stünden. Insgesamt ordnete Pirow die Entwicklung des südafrikanischen Zivilflugwesens militärischen Erfordernissen unter. Nach einer bislang nicht verifizierbaren These befürchtete er dabei eigentlich einen militärischen Angriff Japans auf Südafrika und beschwor die „schwarze Gefahr“ vor allem deshalb, um die südafrikanische Öffentlichkeit überhaupt für Rüstungsanstrengungen zu motivieren. Wie auch Premierminister Hertzog signalisierte Pirow Sympathien für ein kolonialistisches Engagement des nationalsozialistischen Deutschlands, weil er Übereinstimmungen in der rassistischen „Eingeborenenpolitik“ sah. Pirow definierte die südafrikanische Rassenpolitik als eine, die zwar die Entwicklung der Schwarzen verfolge, aber vor allem „dem Neger ein für alle Mal die soziale und politische Gleichstellung mit dem Europäer“ versage. Deutschland sei ein „Hauptträger […] unserer westeuropäischen weißen Zivilisation“, die sich nur „durch geschlossenes Zusammenarbeiten Aller behaupten“ könne und „heute mehr denn je, wo die farbige Flutwelle immer höher“ brande, die „tatkräftige Unterstützung eines starken Deutschlands“ brauche. Eine Rückgabe des Mandatsgebiets Südwestafrika an Deutschland war dabei jedoch auf Grund eigener machtpolitischer Interessen Südafrikas ausgeschlossen. Deutschland sollte stattdessen Kolonien in Mittel- und Westafrika erhalten. Aus südafrikanischer Perspektive sollte Deutschland dadurch nicht nur die Schwarzen in Mittel- und Westafrika kontrollieren, sondern auch das befürchtete Vordringen Frankreichs und Italiens nach Süden aufhalten. Den südafrikanischen Herrschaftsanspruch markierte Pirow mit den Gebieten südlich des Äquators ausschließlich Französisch-Äquatorialafrikas. Auch im Justizressort machte Pirow noch seinen Einfluss geltend, indem er 1936 federführend an der Formulierung der Rassengesetze beteiligt war, durch die Schwarze von der allgemeinen Wählerliste gestrichen wurden. „Appeasement“ in Europa Pirow hielt den Kommunismus für die größte Gefahr und den Faschismus für die einzige Abhilfe. Als erklärter Bewunderer Benito Mussolinis, António de Oliveira Salazars und Francisco Francos reiste er mehrfach nach Europa. Im August 1933 traf er auch erstmals mit Adolf Hitler zusammen, den er als „Mann von Weltformat“ bezeichnete. Vom Einfluss des Nationalsozialismus versprach er sich die Steigerung des Rassebewusstseins unter der weißen Bevölkerung Südafrikas. Während es bei der Reise 1933 offiziell um Wirtschaftsbeziehungen zwischen Deutschland und Südafrika ging, legte Pirow besonderen Wert auf ein Treffen mit Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, den er als Instrukteur für eine neu aufzubauende schwarze Armee gewinnen wollte. Pirow sah darin eine Präventivmaßnahme gegen Aufstände „militärisch ausgebildeter schwarzer Völker Afrikas gegen die weiße Rasse“. Zwar kam das Projekt letztendlich nicht zu Stande, aber Pirow machte auch in den folgenden Jahren auf sich aufmerksam, als er immer wieder die Kolonialfrage ansprach und die Hoffnung ausdrückte, dass Deutschland bald wieder Kolonialmacht in Afrika werde. 1936 versuchte Pirow bei einem Besuch in London vergeblich, sich nach der Rheinlandkrise als Vermittler zu Deutschland anzubieten. 1937 vermittelten Premierminister Hertzog und vor allem Pirow dem deutschen Gesandten Emil Wiehl den Eindruck, dass Großbritannien zwar an einem neuen Garantiepakt über die deutsche Westgrenze interessiert sei, aber dafür den Deutschen „freie Hand im Osten“ gewähren würde. Pirow informierte den deutschen Gesandten auch darüber, dass die militärische Aufrüstung Südafrikas „in gutem Gange“ sei, so dass sich in absehbarer Zeit der Machtschwerpunkt in Afrika südlich der Sahara von Kontinentaleuropa nach Pretoria verlagern werde. Mitte September 1937 äußerte sich Pirow gegenüber Konsul Bruno Stiller, er halte die „Befriedigung deutscher Kolonialansprüche“ in nächster Zeit für notwendig, wobei er eine Rückgabe Südwestafrikas und Tanganyikas zwar ausschloss, aber ein Festsetzen Deutschlands an der Westküste Afrikas wünschte und territoriale Kompensation etwa in Gestalt Liberias in Aussicht stellte. Besonderes Aufsehen erregte eine Deutschland-Reise Pirows im November 1938, bei der er zunächst Lieferverträge für Flugzeuge und Lokomotiven abschloss. Die Reise wurde aber auch von Gerüchten begleitet, Pirow wolle die Kolonialfrage erörtern und der Appeasement-Politik neuen Auftrieb geben. Die Haltung der britischen Regierung war dabei ausgesprochen skeptisch, nicht zuletzt weil andere Kolonialmächte wie Portugal, Belgien und Frankreich solche Erörterungen für unangebracht hielten. Während Pirow deutsche Kolonialgebiete im nun französisch verwalteten Togo und Kamerun anregte, zeigte er andererseits keine Bereitschaft, dass Südafrika seinerseits Gebiete zurückgeben würde. Die britische Regierung nahm Pirows Reise somit in erster Linie als eine Möglichkeit, die südafrikanische Politik besser einschätzen zu lernen. Pirow zumindest berichtete nach dem Krieg selbst, Jan Smuts habe ihn nach Deutschland geschickt, um zwischen Deutschland und Großbritannien in der „Judenfrage“ zu vermitteln. Seine ausführliche Darstellung in der rechtsradikalen Zeitschrift Nation Europa diente allerdings nicht zuletzt dazu, sich selbst zum Friedensstifter zu stilisieren. Pirow behauptete, er habe vom britischen Premierminister Neville Chamberlain entsprechende Zusagen erhalten, Hitler für eine Mäßigung bei der Behandlung der Juden „freie Hand“ im Osten anzubieten. An anderer Stelle führte er aus, er habe Chamberlain einen Plan britischer Juden vorgeschlagen, den Juden ein „national home“ in Madagaskar, Tanganyika oder Britisch-Guayana einzurichten, für das Hitler den deutschen Juden eine halbe Milliarde Pfund oder ihren halben Besitz überlassen sollte, und die britischen Juden eine weitere halbe Milliarde beisteuern sollten. Chamberlain habe sofort akzeptiert, aber alle Pläne seien nach den Novemberpogromen obsolet geworden. An Pirows Darstellung und insbesondere seiner Beurteilung der Chancen auf eine Einigung sind Zweifel angebracht. In den Akten findet diese Darstellung keine Bestätigung. Auf der einen Seite findet sich in der von Walter Hewel besorgten Aufzeichnung von Pirows Gespräch mit Hitler kein Hinweis auf das angebliche Angebot einer „freien Hand in Osten“. Auf der anderen Seite lassen britische Dokumente auch keinen Zweifel, dass die britische Regierung niemals erwog, Hitler „freie Hand“ zu gewähren. Pirows Initiative stand im Zusammenhang mit seinerzeit öffentlich diskutierten Überlegungen, europäische Juden in Madagaskar anzusiedeln, die von deutscher Seite 1940 im sogenannten Madagaskarplan wieder aufgegriffen wurden. Pirow scheint zumindest der britischen Seite Madagaskar als „Flüchtlingsstaat“ vorgeschlagen zu haben. Außenminister Joachim von Ribbentrop blockte Pirows Vorschläge jedoch bei einem Treffen am 18. November 1938 ab, wobei hier von Madagaskar als potentiellem Flüchtlingsstaat keine Rede war. Kolonialpolitische Fragen wollte Ribbentrop erst „in einigen Jahren (5-6)“ besprechen. Bei einem Treffen mit Hitler am 24. November argumentierte Pirow, das Angebot, Juden in den ehemaligen deutschen Kolonien anzusiedeln, würde eine neue Situation in der internationalen Diskussion der Kolonialfrage schaffen. Doch Hitler, der die „Judenfrage“ nicht durch überseeische Aussiedlung lösen wollte, lehnte diese Pläne ab und untersagte dem Oberkommando der Wehrmacht entsprechende Planungen. Pirow seinerseits hatte klargemacht, dass Deutschland zwar als Partner bei der Beherrschung der Schwarzen in Afrika willkommen sei, aber nicht gegen südafrikanische Interessen auf dem afrikanischen Kontinent. „Neue Ordnung“ Pirow galt während der 1930er Jahre als einer der einflussreichsten Politiker Südafrikas, wichtiger Berater von Premierminister Hertzog und gar als dessen „Kronprinz“, hatte gegen Ende der 1930er Jahre aber schon erheblich an Einfluss verloren. Hertzogs Regierung war am Ende, als das Parlament am 4. September 1939 Hertzogs Neutralitätskurs ablehnte, Jan Smuts die Regierung übernahm und Deutschland den Krieg erklärte. Extremistische Afrikaaner erwarteten einen Staatsstreich Pirows, der davor aber zurückschreckte. Er vermutete hinter der Entscheidung vom 4. September eine Verschwörung. 1940 veröffentlichte Pirow das Pamphlet Nuwe Orde vir Suid-Afrika (deutsch Neue Ordnung für Südafrika), in welchem er seine politischen Vorstellungen ausbreitete. Er war überzeugt, dass Deutschland den Krieg gewinnen werde, und wollte entsprechende Vorbereitungen treffen. Die Lösung für Südafrika liege nicht in der Demokratie, sondern in einem autoritären, korporativen Führerstaat. Nach Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs betonte er, sich am portugiesischen „Estado Novo“ Salazars orientiert zu haben, tatsächlich dürfte sein Vorbild aber der deutsche Nationalsozialismus gewesen sein. Innerhalb der von Hertzog mit Daniel François Malan 1940 gegründeten „Wiedervereinigten“ Nationalen Partei bildete Pirow am 25. September 1940 eine eigene Fraktion mit dem Namen Nuwe Orde (‚Neue Ordnung‘). Bei der Nuwe Orde handelte es sich allerdings weniger um eine politische Bewegung als um einen Studienkreis, um eine politische Programmatik auszuarbeiten. Innerhalb der Wiedervereinigten Nationalen Partei blieb diese offen nationalsozialistische Fraktion eine Splittergruppe, zumal Pirow keine ethnischen Unterschiede zwischen burischen und englischen Weißen machte. Einflussreiche Vertreter eines Afrikaanernationalismus wie Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd betonten aber die Eigenständigkeit der burischen Nation. Malan reagierte, indem er behauptete, 80 bis 85 Prozent der Pirowschen Forderungen seien bereits im Parteiprogramm der Wiedervereinigten Nationalen Partei enthalten, die politische Tradition der Afrikaaner sei jedoch demokratisch. Parteiführer Malan zwang die Bewegung im August 1941, ihre Propaganda einzustellen. Daraufhin gründeten Pirow und 17 seiner Unterstützer im Parlament Nuwe Orde am 16. August neu. 1942 brach die Gruppe endgültig mit der Wiedervereinigten Nationalen Partei. Pirow trat 1943 nicht mehr zur Parlamentswahl an und nahm seine Anwaltspraxis wieder auf. Annäherungsversuche Pirows an Malan scheiterten. Im Oktober 1945 begann er das Wochenblatt Die Nuwe Orde zu publizieren. Am 19. September 1947 führte ein Artikel in dieser Zeitung dazu, dass Pirow wegen Aufstachelung zur Gewalt zu einer Geldstrafe in Höhe von 40 Pfund verurteilt wurde. Danach verlor seine Nuwe Orde endgültig ihre politische Relevanz. Kontakte mit Rechtsextremisten Pirow schrieb nun Abenteuer- und Kinderbücher, versuchte aber auch weiterhin, mit seinen politischen Publikationen die Apartheid zu beeinflussen. Zugleich begann er, sich neue Bundesgenossen in rechtsextremistischen Kreisen zu suchen. 1948 traf er sich mit dem britischen Faschistenführer Oswald Mosley und entwickelte mit ihm Vorstellungen, Afrika in rein weiße und rein schwarze Regionen aufzuteilen. Im Dezember 1947 hatten sie bereits Pläne geschmiedet, eine Gruppe mit dem Namen „Feinde der Sowjetunion“ zu gründen. Pirow schrieb Artikel für Mosleys Zeitschriften Union und The European, von denen einige auch in der deutschen Zeitschrift Nation Europa veröffentlicht wurden. Um 1953 hingegen wandte sich Pirow dem britischen Rechtsextremisten A. F. X. Baron und dessen Nachrichtendienst Nationalist Information Bureau (NATINFORM) zu. Während des Treason Trials fungierte Pirow bis zu seinem plötzlichen Tod zeitweise als Chefankläger. Eine Straße, die in Kapstadt nach Oswald Pirow benannt worden war, wurde 2011 nach Christiaan Barnard umbenannt. |
G;|Sir William Francis Butler GCB (* 31. Oktober 1838 in Suirville, Co. Tipperary, Irland; † 7. Juni 1910 in Bansha Castle, Co. Tipperary) war ein britischer Generalleutnant und Autor. Er kämpfte in verschiedenen britischen Kolonialkriegen (u.a. an der Goldküste und in Südafrika) und verfasste vielbeachtete Reiseberichte, Biographien und Werke der erzählenden Literatur. Butler war Mitglied der Royal Geographical Society.  William Butler war das siebte Kind von Richard und Ellen Butler aus Suirville, Irland. Die Butlers stammten von Thomas Butler, 10. Earl of Ormonde ab. Zu Williams frühesten Kindheitserinnerungen gehörten die große Hungersnot in Irland, die Vertreibungen und Daniel O’Connell. Da die Familie römisch-katholisch war, waren die Katholikenverfolgung, die Strafgesetze und die britische Regierung ständiges Thema. Diese Dinge hinterließen bei William einen bleibenden Eindruck. Seit 1847 besuchte er das Jesuitenkolleg in Tullabeg, King's County, und danach Dr. James Quinn's School in Dublin. Erste Jahre in der Armee Am 17. September 1858 trat er als Fähnrich des 69. Regiments zu Fuß in die britische Armee ein. Nachdem er zwei Jahre lang im Depot in Fermoy gedient hatte, ging er ins Hauptquartier des Regiments in Tonghoo, Birma. Im Frühjahr 1862 wurde das Regiment nach Madras verlegt und 1863 nahm Butler zwei Monate Urlaub, um die Westküste Indiens von Kalkutta bis Kap Cormorin zu bereisen. In Vellore sorgte er dafür, dass für die 1806 dort getöteten Angehörigen seines Regiments ein Denkmal errichtet wurde. Am 17. November 1863 wurde er zum Leutnant befördert. Das Regiment kehrte im Frühjahr 1864 nach Hause zurück und Butler machte während der Rückreise zwei Tage auf St. Helena Station, zwei Tage "eingetaucht in Ruhm und Trauer". Von seiner Garnison in Gosport wurde das Regiment 1865 nach Aldershot verlegt. Butler begann hier die Niederschrift seiner Regimentsgeschichte, die 1870 veröffentlicht wurde (A Narrative of the Historical Events connected with the 69th Regiment). Im Sommer 1866 ging Butler mit seinem Regiment auf die Kanalinseln, wo er Bekanntschaft mit Victor Hugo machte. Nach einem fünfmonatigen Zwischenaufenthalt in Curragh, Irland, schiffte sich das Regiment im August 1867 nach Kanada ein. Es wurde in Brantford, im Norden des Eriesees, stationiert. Butler erhielt im September drei Monate Urlaub, in denen er "the glorious prairies" mit ihren Büffelherden bereiste. Kanada, Red River Expedition Im Frühjahr 1868 löste er Leutnant Redvers Buller als Wachoffizier an der Grenze ab und musste 1500 Meilen im Monat reisen, um die Posten zu besuchen. Im September 1869 erhielt er Heimaturlaub. Im März 1870 starb sein Vater und wurde in Killardrigh beerdigt; seine Mutter war schon 1849 gestorben. Butler trat die Rückreise nach Kanada an, erfuhr aber noch bevor er Irland verlassen hatte, dass Oberst Wolseley, den er schon zwei Jahre zuvor kennengelernt hatte, dabei war, eine Expedition zum Roten Fluss (Red River) zusammenzustellen. Dort war 1869 die Red River Rebellion der Métis, unter ihrem Führer Louis Riel, ausgebrochen. Er telegrafierte sofort "Remember Butler 69th regiment". Es gab zwar in Wolseleys Stab keine freien Stellen mehr, als Butler Toronto erreichte, aber er erhielt eine unabhängige Mission zur Siedlung am Red River, um herauszufinden wie die Lage dort war. Butler brach am 8. Juni auf, reiste durch die Vereinigten Staaten, den Red River hinab nach Winnipeg, traf Louis Riel und stieß am 4. August ungefähr auf der Hälfte ihrer vorgesehenen Marschroute auf die Expedition. Er begleitete sie nach Fort Garry, aus dem Riel geflohen war, und blieb auch nach dem Abzug der Expedition dort. Am 24. Oktober brach er zu einer neuen Mission nach Saskatchewan auf, um über den Truppenbedarf, die Indianer und den Pelzhandel dort zu berichten. Er erreichte den nördlichen Saskatchewan in Carlton, folgte ihm bis zu seinem Ursprung in den Rocky Mountains und reiste dann den Fluss hinab, wo er am 20. Februar 1871 nach einer Winterreise von 2700 Meilen wieder Fort Garry erreichte. Über seine Reise verfasste er den Bericht The Great Lone Land, der 1872 erschien und es schon bis zum nächsten Jahr auf vier Auflagen brachte. Sein Bericht an den Vize-Gouverneur in Manitoba erschien im Anhang dieses Buches. Seine Arbeit brachte ihm viel Lob, aber wenig substanzielle Anerkennung ein. Erst am 13. April 1872 erhielt Butler das Kommando über eine unabhängige Kompanie. Ein erfolgreicher Landverkauf ermöglichte ihm das Reisen. Er kehrte nach Kanada zurück, besuchte den Athabascasee und sammelte Material für sein nächstes Buch The Wild North Land, erschienen 1873. Ende August 1873 war er zurück in Ottawa und erfuhr, dass Sir Garnet Wolseley eine militärische Expedition gegen die Aschanti zusammenstellte. Er eilte zurück nach England und sandte wieder ein Telegramm voraus. Bei seiner Ankunft fand er Wolseleys Befehl vor, ihm nach Westafrika zu folgen. Aschanti-Krieg Butler erreichte Cape Coast Castle am 22. Oktober 1873. Er wurde sofort nach Accra geschickt, um ins Landesinnere zu den westlichen Akim zu reisen, deren Krieger aufzubieten und die Aschanti-Armee an ihrem Rückzug über den Prah zu hindern. Diese Aufgabe stellte sich als undurchführbar heraus. Unter äußersten Schwierigkeiten brachte er die Akim dazu, in Richtung Kumasi vorzurücken, ostwärts der Hauptstoßrichtung. Ende Januar 1874 stand Butler mit 1400 Akim weniger als 20 Meilen vor Kumasi. Damit hatte er seine Aufgabe erfüllt. Wolseley berichtete in der London Gazette vom 7. März 1874: "He has effected a most important diversion in favour of the main body and has detained before him all the forces of one of the most powerful Ashanti chiefs." Butler hatte mehrere Fieberattacken und musste zwei Monate im Netley Hospital verbringen, bevor er nach England zurückreisen konnte. Er hatte zu den 35 Offizieren gehört die Wolseley für diesen Einsatz ausgewählt hatte und die später den sogenannten Ashanti-Ring bildeten (Die Gruppe erlangte durch gegenseitige Unterstützung einen bedeutenden Einfluss auf die viktorianische British Army und übernahm bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts die führenden Positionen). Nach dem Aschanti-Einsatz wurde er zum Major befördert, zum Companion des Order of the Bath (CB) ernannt und erhielt die Feldzugsmedaille mit einer Spange. Seinen Anteil am Aschanti-Feldzug beschrieb er in dem Bericht Akim-Foo: the History of a Failure, 1875. Südafrika I, Zulukrieg Während er an diesem Buch schrieb und sich in Irland erholte, wurde er zu einem Spezialauftrag nach Natal gerufen. Sir Garnet Wolseley war dort im Februar 1875 vorübergehend Gouverneur geworden, um für Ruhe und Ordnung zu sorgen. Butler begleitet ihn und wurde zum Protector der indischen Immigranten ernannt mit Sitz in Rat und Versammlung. Er wurde auf eine Mission in den Oranje-Freistaat, nach Kimberley, und nach Basutoland geschickt, während der er die Bekanntschaft vieler Einwohner, Briten und Buren, machte. Er kehrte im Oktober nach England zurück und wurde am 30. November stellvertretender Assistant Quartermaster-General der Armee. Auf diesem Posten blieb er, bis er Ende Februar 1879 wieder nach Südafrika ging, um am Zulukrieg teilzunehmen. Dort blieb er bis zum Ende des Jahres, nahm aber als Standortkommandant von Durban nicht an den Kampfhandlungen teil. Er wurde abermals im Kriegsbericht erwähnt und am 21. April 1880 zum Brevet-Oberstleutnant ernannt. Vom 1. Juli 1880 bis Ende August 1884 war Butler, mit Ausnahme der Zeit von August bis Oktober 1882, als er in Wolseleys Stab an der Expedition zur Niederschlagung des Urabi-Aufstandes in Ägypten teilnahm, Stabsoffizier in Devonport. Er nahm an der Schlacht von Tel-el-Kebir teil, in der die ägyptische Armee zerschlagen wurde, wurde wieder im Kriegsbericht erwähnt (The London Gazette, 2. November 1882), erhielt die Feldzugsmedaille mit Spange, den Medjidieh-Orden 3. Klasse und den Bronze Star. Am 18. November 1882 wurde er im Rang eines Colonels Adjutant der Königin. Sudan, Karthum, Giniss Als 1884 die Gordon Relief Expedition zur Rettung Gordons und zum Entsatz von Khartum vor dem Mahdi-Aufstand diskutiert wurde, fragte Wolseley Butler um Rat. Butler setzte sich sehr dafür ein, mit Booten den Nil aufwärtszufahren, wie es auch bei der Red-River-Expedition gemacht worden war. Er hatte Gordon einige Jahre zuvor kennengelernt und war von ihm sehr beeindruckt. Er erachtete die Rettungsaktion als “the very first war during the Victorian era, in which the object was entirely noble and worthy”. Am 12. August erhielt er das Kommando über 400 Boote, die innerhalb eines Monats ausgerüstet und einsatzbereit waren; einige davon waren schon auf dem Weg. Butler reiste im September nach Ägypten und unternahm in den nächsten drei Monaten alle Anstrengungen, um die Boote und die Soldaten über die Nil-Katarakte zu befördern. Nachdem das erreicht war, ging er ins Hauptquartier in Korti und wurde General Earles River Column zugeteilt. Der Sieg bei Kirbekan am 10. Februar 1885 ist weitgehend ihm zu verdanken, da er das Gelände, auf dem die Mahdisten sich aufgestellt hatten, erkundet hatte und Earle überzeugen konnte, die Mahdisten nicht frontal anzugreifen, sondern sie zu einer Schwenkung zu zwingen. Als die Kolonne nilabwärts abrückte, übernahm Butler das Kommando über die Nachhut, die in Meroë zurückblieb. Im Juni führte er seine Truppe nach Dongola und kehrte nach England zurück. Er wurde wiederum im Kriegsbericht erwähnt (The London Gazette, 10. April und 25. August 1885) und erhielt zwei Spangen. Großbritannien unterließ für die nächsten 10 Jahre weitere Versuche in den Sudan vorzudringen und beschränkte sich auf das Halten einiger weniger Stützpunkte. Nur Suakin und Wadi Halfa, in der Nähe der ägyptischen Grenze, blieben besetzt. Im September kehrte Butler nach Wadi Halfa zurück. Er erhielt am 1. Juli 1885 im lokalen Rang eines Brigadegenerals das Kommando über die Truppen an der Grenze zum Sudan. Im Dezember marschierten die Mahdisten erneut von Dongola heran und griffen ihn bei Kosheh an. Butler hatte vier Bataillone, zwei davon britisch, einige Kavallerie und aufgesessene Infanterie. Er hatte außerdem einige Forts errichten lassen. Die Mahdisten unterbrachen die Eisenbahnlinie, konnten aber sonst wenig erreichen und wurden, als Ende des Monats Verstärkungen von Kairo herangerückt waren, bei Giniss entscheidend geschlagen. Butler kommandierte in dieser Schlacht eine der beiden Brigaden in General Stephensons Streitmacht und wurde wieder im Kriegsbericht erwähnt (The London Gazette, 6. Februar 1886). Vier britische Bataillone wurden unter seinem Kommando in Wadi Halfa zurückgelassen, hatten aber sehr unter der großen Hitze zu leiden. Daher wurden sie im Mai durch ägyptische Truppen ersetzt und Butler selbst Ende Juni krankheitshalber abgelöst. England Er kehrte verbittert nach England zurück. Er hatte für seine Anstrengungen keinen Lohn erhalten, seine Warnungen und Proteste stießen auf Widerstand und es gab keine neue Verwendung für ihn. Am 25. November wurde er zum Ritter des Bathordens (KCB) ernannt und verbrachte die nächsten zwei Jahre in Irland und Britannien. Er schrieb The Campaign of the Cataracts, das 1885 erschien, und schloss, selbst ein Verfechter der Home-Rule-Politik, enge Freundschaft mit Charles Stewart Parnell. Im Herbst 1888 führte er zusammen mit Colonel Macgregor eine Untersuchung im Ordnance Store Department durch. Der Bericht, den er entworfen hatte, wies der zivilen Verwaltung des Kriegsministeriums soviel Schuld zu, dass er nicht veröffentlicht wurde. Während des Jahres 1889 war Butler mit Verhandlungen zum Ankauf von Armeedepots im Süden und Osten von London beschäftigt. Ägypten Im Februar 1890 ging Butler wieder nach Ägypten, um das Kommando über die Garnison von Alexandria zu übernehmen. 1877 hatte er Elizabeth Southerden Thompson, eine bekannte Malerin militärischer Bilder (The Roll Call, 1874; Quatre Bras, 1875; Scotland Forever!, 1881), geheiratet. Mit ihr bereiste er Palästina, einmal aus religiösem Interesse und auch, um die Stätten der napoleonischen Kriege aufzusuchen. Am 7. Dezember 1892 wurde er zum Generalmajor befördert und erhielt am 11. November das Kommando über eine Brigade in Aldershot, Hampshire. Am 24. Februar wechselte er zum Kommando des südöstlichen Distrikts und erhielt am 12. Dezember 1894 eine Auszeichnung für seine Dienste. Südafrika II 1898 folgte er, im lokalen Rang eines Generalleutnants, dem verstorbenen General William Howley Goodenough als Oberbefehlshaber in Südafrika. Während der Abwesenheit Sir Alfred Milners war er für kurze Zeit (2. November 1898 bis 14. Februar 1899) auch vertretungsweise Hochkommissar in Südafrika. Nach Milners Rückkehr im Februar 1899 wurde Butler von den Aufgaben der Zivilverwaltung entpflichtet. Er hatte den Auftrag erhalten, für den Fall plötzlich ausbrechender Feindseligkeiten einen Verteidigungsplan für die Kapkolonie und Natal auszuarbeiten. Er reiste deshalb nach Natal und erarbeitete seinen Plan, behielt ihn aber, da er mit der Ablehnung desselben durch das Kriegsministerium rechnete, für sich, bis er im Juni entschieden zur Abgabe aufgefordert wurde. Seine Beziehung zum Hochkommissar war deutlich gespannt, da beide unterschiedliche Ansichten über die Lage hatten. Für Butler war alles nur “a plot to force war on the Transvaal”, den er mit allen Mitteln zu verhindern suchte. Eine Rüge des Kriegsministeriums führte schließlich dazu, dass er am 4. Juli seinen Abschied einreichte, der auch angenommen wurde. Er übergab sein Kommando am 23. August und kehrte nach England zurück. Western Distrikt Dort übernahm er am 8. September 1899 das Kommando über den Western District. Butler hielt dieses Kommando sechs Jahre. Unterbrochen wurde diese Zeit von den vier Monaten, die er Ende 1900/Anfang 1901 die Garnison Aldershot anstelle Redvers Bullers kommandierte, der den Oberbefehl im Burenkrieg übernahm. Butler wurde am 9. Oktober 1900 zum Generalleutnant befördert. Im Februar 1903 sagte er vor der Kommission über den Burenkrieg aus. Im Frühjahr 1905 führte er den Vorsitz im Komitee über die Verwendung der militärischen Vorratslager in Südafrika. Sein Bericht vom 22. Mai führte dazu, dass eine Kommission unter dem Vorsitz von Sir George Farwell gebildet wurde, die seine scharfe Kritik abmilderte. Ruhestand Am 31. Oktober 1905 wurde er nach Erreichen des Pensionsalters von 67 Jahren auf die Ruhestandsliste gesetzt. Im Juni 1906 erhielt er das Großkreuz des Bathordens und wurde 1909 in den irischen Staatsrat (Privy Council) berufen. Er wurde Gouverneur der Royal Hibernian Military School, Senatsmitglied der National University of Ireland und Mitglied des Board of National Education in Irland. Butler starb am 7. Juni 1910 in Bansha Castle, Co. Tipperary, wo er seit seinem Ruhestand seinen Wohnsitz hatte, und wurde mit militärischen Ehren in der Familiengrabstätte in Killardrigh beigesetzt. Er hinterließ seine Frau, die seine unvollendeten Memoiren herausgab, drei Söhne und zwei Töchter. Die jüngste Tochter, Eileen, heiratete 1912 Jenico Preston, Viscount Gormanston. |
G;|Brian Harold May, CBE (* 19. Juli 1947 in Hampton, Middlesex, heute im London Borough of Richmond upon Thames) ist ein britischer Gitarrist, Komponist, Sänger, Astrophysiker, Sachbuchautor und Tierschützer. Er ist am besten bekannt als Leadgitarrist der Rockband Queen. May war zusammen mit Leadsänger Freddie Mercury und Schlagzeuger Roger Taylor Gründungsmitglied von Queen, nachdem er zuvor mit Taylor in der Band Smile gespielt hatte. Nach der Komplettierung der Besetzung durch Bassist John Deacon etablierten sich Queen als eine der führenden britischen Rockbands. Von Mitte der 1970er Jahre bis zu Beginn der 1990er Jahre waren Queen fast ständig in den britischen Musikcharts vertreten. Mit Queen erlangte May weltweite Bekanntheit als virtuoser Musiker. Zu seinen typischen Stilmitteln gehören die Rückkopplung und der Echo-Effekt seiner selbstgebauten Gitarre Red Special. Die Verwendung von Münzen anstelle eines Plektrums prägte Queens typischen Gitarren-Klang ebenfalls. Zu Mays Kompositionen für die Band gehören unter anderem We Will Rock You, Tie Your Mother Down, I Want It All, Fat Bottomed Girls, Flash, Hammer to Fall, Save Me, Who Wants to Live Forever und The Show Must Go On. Nach Mercurys Tod im Jahr 1991 verfolgte May eine Solo-Karriere, bis er Queen zusammen mit Taylor und Gastsängern wieder aufleben ließ. Nach dreieinhalb Jahrzehnten kehrte May an das Londoner Imperial College zurück, um seine Doktorarbeit zu beenden, die sich mit Radialgeschwindigkeiten im interplanetaren Staub befasst und 2007 angenommen wurde. Von 2008 bis 2013 war er Ehrenkanzler der Liverpool John Moores University. May ist ein Aktivist der Tierrechtsbewegung und seit 2012 Vizepräsident der Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.    Familie und frühe Jahre Vater Harold May war Elektroingenieur und diente während des Zweiten Weltkriegs in der Royal Air Force. Danach war er als technischer Zeichner für das britische Luftfahrtministerium tätig und an der Entwicklung der Concorde beteiligt. Mutter Ruth May stammte aus Schottland. Die Familie lebte in Feltham, einem westlichen Vorort von London in der Grafschaft Middlesex. Brian May war ein Einzelkind, bastelte gerne und zeigte früh musikalisches Talent, was seine Eltern mit Klavierunterricht förderten. Als er sechs Jahre alt war, brachte ihm sein Vater die Grundlagen für das Spielen der Banjolele bei, einer Kombination aus Banjo und Ukulele, die in den 1930er Jahren durch George Formby jr. in Großbritannien populär geworden war. Zu seinem siebten Geburtstag erhielt May das erste eigene Instrument geschenkt, eine spanische Akustikgitarre. Für diese bastelte er einen Single-Coil-Tonabnehmer, um einen elektrischen Klang zu imitieren, wobei er das Radio der Familie als Verstärker benutzte. Er spielte Lieder auf Schallplatten nach und verbesserte so seine eigenen Fähigkeiten als Gitarrenspieler. May begann sich auch für die Sterne und den Nachthimmel zu interessieren und bastelte ein kleines Teleskop. Nach dem Besuch der Grundschule an der Hanworth Road in Feltham kam May als Elfjähriger an die Grammar School in Hampton, unterstützt durch ein Stipendium, das er für seine hervorragenden schulischen Leistungen erhalten hatte. Bald merkte er, dass seine Akustikgitarre seinen Ansprüchen nicht mehr genügte. Da E-Gitarren teuer waren, kam er auf die Idee, selbst eine zu bauen. Zusammen mit seinem Vater begann er im August 1963 mit dem Bau der später berühmt gewordenen Red Special. Sie entstand aus Gegenständen, die im Haus der Mays zu finden waren, Teilen eines alten Motorrads, einem Eichenbrett und einer über hundertjährigen Mahagoni-Kaminverkleidung. Das Tremolo fertigten sie aus einem Brotmesser. Nur die Burns-Tonabnehmer musste er kaufen. Nach 18 Monaten war die Gitarre vollendet. Die ersten Bands: 1984 und Smile (1964–1970) Im Herbst 1964 gründete May zusammen mit Tim Staffell und anderen Mitschülern eine Band namens 1984, benannt nach dem gleichnamigen Roman von George Orwell. Ihren ersten Auftritt hatten sie am 28. Oktober in der St Mary’s Hall in Twickenham. In den folgenden drei Jahren hatten sie zahlreiche Auftritte in Pubs, Clubs und Schulen, dabei spielten sie eine Mischung aus Musikstilen von Sam & Dave und Otis Redding. May schloss die Grammar School mit dem General Certificate of Education ab, in den Fächern Physik, Mathematik und angewandte Physik mit dem Advanced Level. Er wollte Astronom werden und begann im Herbst 1965 am Londoner Imperial College mit dem Studium der Physik und der Infrarotastronomie. Am 13. Mai 1967 spielten 1984 im Imperial College als Vorband von Jimi Hendrix, am 23. Dezember desselben Jahres traten sie zusammen mit Tyrannosaurus Rex, The Herd, Jimi Hendrix, Traffic und Pink Floyd bei einem Weihnachtsfestival im Olympia Theatre auf. Anfang 1968 löste sich die Band auf. Ausschlaggebend waren musikalische Differenzen und die Tatsache, dass May mehr Zeit für sein Studium benötigte. Unter anderem leitete er den Bau einer kleinen Schutzhütte auf der Testa Grigia bei Zermatt in der Schweiz, um dort Geräte zur Beobachtung des Zodiakallichts zu lagern. Er verbrachte dort einige Zeit, wegen des andauernd schlechten Wetters wurden die Hütte und die Geräte aber bald nach Teneriffa gebracht und am Teide aufgestellt. May erhielt von Professor Bernard Lovell das Angebot, ihm bei seinen Forschungen im Jodrell-Bank-Radioobservatorium zu unterstützen. Nach langem Zögern lehnte er ab, da er in London bleiben wollte, um sich musikalisch weiterzuentwickeln. Im Herbst 1968 gründeten May und Staffell die Band Smile. Zu ihnen gesellte sich der Zahnmedizinstudent Roger Taylor als Schlagzeuger. May schloss sein Studium ab und erhielt am 24. Oktober 1968 im Rahmen einer Feier in der Royal Albert Hall von der Königinmutter den akademischen Grad eines Bachelor of Science (BSc) überreicht. Zwei Tage später hatten Smile im Imperial College ihr erstes Konzert, als Vorgruppe von Pink Floyd. Über Staffell lernten May und Taylor den Kunststudenten Farrokh „Freddie“ Bulsara (Freddie Mercury) kennen, der die Band als Fan unterstützte und ihr Erscheinungsbild mitgestaltete. Ein Plattenvertrag für ein Album kam nicht zustande. Staffell trennte sich im Frühjahr 1970 von der Band, wodurch Smile aufhörte zu existieren. 1970–1991: Weltweiter Erfolg mit Queen und Soloprojekte Im April 1970 gründeten May, Taylor und Mercury die Band Queen. Nachdem sie mehrmals den Bassisten wechseln mussten, lernten sie den angehenden Elektroniker John Deacon kennen, womit die Besetzung im Februar 1971 komplett war. Über einen Bekannten gelang es May im September 1971, Studiozeit für Demo-Aufnahmen zu organisieren: Mehrere Monate lang konnten sie in den neu eröffneten De Lane Lea Studios unter professionellen Bedingungen arbeiten, was ihnen den Weg zum ersten Plattenvertrag ebnete. Im Juli 1973 wurde das Debütalbum Queen veröffentlicht. May arbeitete in seiner freien Zeit weiterhin an seiner Dissertation, außerdem gab er private Nachhilfestunden am Imperial College. Im September 1973 nahm er für einige Monate eine Teilzeitstelle als Englischlehrer an einer Gesamtschule im Südosten Londons an. Im Mai 1974 mussten Queen einen Teil ihrer US-Tournee absagen, weil May wegen des Gebrauchs nicht-steriler Impfnadeln an Hepatitis erkrankt war und mehrere Wochen im Krankenhaus verbrachte. Auch die nachfolgende US-Tournee wurde abgesagt, weil er im Juli 1974 wegen eines Zwölffingerdarmgeschwürs operiert werden musste. Dessen ungeachtet, schafften Queen den internationalen Durchbruch und wurden zu einer der weltweit bekanntesten Rockbands. May entschloss sich, die Arbeit an seiner Dissertation endgültig abzubrechen. Dies führte vorübergehend zu einem Zwist mit seinem Vater, der ihm vorwarf, seine Ausbildung fortzuwerfen; nach zwei Jahren versöhnten sie sich jedoch wieder. Im April 1983, als die Bandmitglieder mit verschiedenen Solo-Projekten beschäftigt waren, traf sich May in einem Studio in Los Angeles mit Eddie Van Halen und weiteren Musikern. Die aus der Jamsession resultierenden Songs, die zunächst nur für den privaten Gebrauch aufgenommen worden waren, veröffentlichte May sechs Monate später auf dem Mini-Album Star Fleet Project. Im selben Jahr produzierte er zusammen mit Reinhold Mack das Album Lettin Loose der schottischen Band Heavy Pettin. 1987 produzierte er das Album Cancel der japanischen Sängerin Minako Honda und schrieb für sie zwei Songs. Im selben Jahr produzierte May für Anita Dobson (seine spätere zweite Ehefrau) das Album Talking of Love, wofür er auch die meisten Lieder schrieb. Ebenfalls 1987 produzierte er das selbstbetitelte Album der Comedy-Metal-Band Bad News.; die Single Anyone Can Fall in Love erreichte Platz 4 in den britischen Single-Charts. May sagte in Interviews, dass er in den späten 1980er und frühen 1990er Jahren unter schweren Depressionen litt. Als Gründe nannte er seine kriselnde Ehe, sein vermeintliches Scheitern als Ehemann und Vater sowie den Tod seines Vaters. Nach dem Tod von Freddie Mercury am 24. November 1991 habe er einen Suizid in Betracht gezogen. Er wies sich selbst in eine Klinik in Arizona ein und meinte dazu: „Ich betrachtete mich als vollkommen krank. Ich war verletzt und zerbrochen. Ich verfiel in eine ernsthafte Depression. Ich war von Gefühlen des Verlusts überwältigt.“ Um seine Trauer zu verarbeiten, bürdete er sich ein großes Arbeitspensum auf, indem er sein Soloalbum Back to the Light vollendete und damit weltweit auf Promotionstour ging. Dies sei die einzige für ihn denkbare Selbsttherapie gewesen. Dazu gehörte auch das Mitorganisieren des Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert zu Ehren des verstorbenen Queen-Sängers, das am 20. April 1992 im Wembley-Stadion stattfand. 1992–1998: The Brian May Band Ende 1992 bildete May die Brian May Band, die ihn auf Solotourneen unterstützte. Ihr gehörten im Laufe der Jahre mehrere renommierte Musiker an, darunter Cozy Powell, Mike Moran, Neil Murray, Spike Edney, Jamie Moses, Miriam Stockley und Chris Thompson. Während eines Teils der US-Tournee 1993 war die Brian May Band die Vorgruppe von Guns N’ Roses. Ende Dezember 1993 kehrte May ins Studio zurück, um mit den verbliebenen Queen-Mitgliedern Roger Taylor und John Deacon am Album Made in Heaven zu arbeiten. Das Album erschien im November 1995; neben Mercurys letzten gesungenen Stücken enthält es auch von den drei übrigen Bandmitgliedern neu eingespielte Songs. 1995 begann May an einem neuen Solo-Album zu arbeiten; es sollte Heroes heißen und ausschließlich Coverversionen enthalten. Daneben war er mit verschiedenen Film- und Fernseh-Soundtracks sowie anderen Gemeinschaftsproduktionen beschäftigt. Nach einiger Zeit ließ er die Coverversionen fallen und konzentrierte sich auf neues Songmaterial. Ergebnis war das im Juni 1998 veröffentlichte Album Another World. Die Vorbereitungen auf die dazugehörende kurze Promotionstournee der Brian May Band erlitten einen schweren Rückschlag, als Cozy Powell am 5. April 1998 bei einem Autounfall nahe Bristol ums Leben kam. Kurzfristig sprang Steve Ferrone als Ersatz ein. Für die eigentliche Tournee verpflichtete May Eric Singer. Nach deren Ende im November 1998 löste sich die Brian May Band auf. Soloprojekte nach 1998 Seit der Veröffentlichung seines letztes Albums im Jahr 1998 trat May entweder als Solokünstler, als Teil eines Ensembles oder gelegentlich zusammen mit Roger Meddows-Taylor als Queen auf. Ab 2000 arbeitete er zusammen mit Taylor und Ben Elton an der Umsetzung des Musicals We Will Rock You, das am 12. Mai 2002 im Dominion Theatre in London seine Premiere hatte. In den folgenden zwölf Jahren traten May und Taylor in dem Musical gelegentlich als Gastmusiker auf. Einen besonders denkwürdigen Auftritt hatte May am 3. Juni 2002 bei der Party at the Palace, die zu Ehren des goldenen Thronjubiläums von Königin Elisabeth II. stattfand, als er auf dem Dach des Buckingham Palace stehend die Nationalhymne God Save the Queen als Gitarrensolo spielte. Im Juni 2005 wurde er für seine „Verdienste um die britische Musikindustrie“ zum Commander des Order of the British Empire ernannt. May arbeitete intensiv mit der Bühnenschauspielerin und Sängerin Kerry Ellis zusammen, die er für die Londoner Originalbesetzung von We Will Rock You gecastet hatte. 2008 produzierte er ihre EP Wicked in Rock, zwei Jahre später war er für die Produktion und das Arrangement ihres Debütalbums Anthems verantwortlich. Seither tritt er oft als Gastmusiker bei ihren Konzerten auf. Seine erfolgreichste Zusammenarbeit mit einem anderen Künstler (gemessen an der Chartsposition) war 2012 mit dem Rapper Dappy: Die Single Rockstar, zu der er ein Gitarrensolo beisteuerte, erreichte Platz 2 in den britischen Single-Charts. Am 12. August 2012 trat May bei der Schlussfeier der Olympischen Sommerspiele 2012: Er spielte zunächst Brighton Rock, danach We Will Rock You zusammen mit Taylor und Jessie J. 2004–2009: Queen + Paul Rodgers Ende 2004 gaben May und Taylor bekannt, dass sie sich wiedervereinigen und auf Tournee gehen würden. Sie verpflichteten Paul Rodgers, den früheren Leadsänger von Free und Bad Company, der aber nicht als offizielles Queen-Mitglied in Erscheinung trat. Queen-Bassist John Deacon verzichtete, da er sich komplett aus dem Musikgeschäft zurückgezogen hatte, ließ aber verlauten, dass er sein Einverständnis gegeben habe. 2005 und 2006 gingen Queen + Paul Rodgers auf eine ausgedehnte Welttournee durch Europa, Nordamerika und Japan. Am 15. August 2006 bestätigte May über seine Website und seinen Fanclub, dass Queen + Paul Rodgers im Oktober „an einem geheimen Ort“ mit der Produktion eines gemeinsamen Albums beginnen würden. Das Album mit dem Titel The Cosmos Rocks erschien am 12. September 2008. Die darauf folgende Tournee begann am selben Tag mit einem Gratiskonzert auf dem Freiheitsplatz in der ukrainischen Stadt Charkiw vor rund 350.000 Zuschauern. Sie führte anschließend durch Europa, die USA, Dubai und Südamerika. Queen + Paul Rodgers trennten sich offiziell am 12. Mai 2009. Rodgers schloss eine mögliche Zusammenarbeit zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt nicht aus. Fünf Jahre später meinte May jedoch, Rodgers’ Stimme sei eher nicht für Queen-Songs geeignet gewesen und passe eher zu Blues und Soul. Seit 2011: Queen + Adam Lambert Am 20. Mai 2009 spielten May und Taylor beim Finale von American Idol live We Are The Champions, zusammen mit dem Sieger Kris Allen und dem Zweitplatzierten Adam Lambert. Zweieinhalb Jahre später, bei den MTV Europe Music Awards 2011 in Belfast, spielten Queen und Lambert drei Songs. Fans und Medien bewerteten den Auftritt überaus positiv, was zu Gerüchten über eine mögliche zukünftige Zusammenarbeit führte. Im Februar 2012 bestätigten May, Taylor und Lambert eine Europa-Tournee. Die Tournee im Sommer 2012 führte durch Osteuropa und endete in London. Im Sommer 2014 gingen Queen + Adam Lambert auf Welttournee und spielten in Nordamerika, Ostasien und Ozeanien. Es folgten eine Europatournee im Winter 2015 sowie eine Südamerika-Tournee im Herbst 2015. Unter anderem spielten Queen erstmals seit 1985 wieder beim Festival Rock in Rio. May, Taylor und Lambert setzten ihre Zusammenarbeit 2016 mit einer Europa-Tournee fort. Arbeiten an einem Studioalbum sind zurzeit nicht geplant. |
G;|Richard Bedford Bennett PC, KC (* 3. Juli 1870 in Hopewell, New Brunswick, Kanada; † 26. Juni 1947 in Mickleham, Surrey, Vereinigtes Königreich) war der elfte Premierminister Kanadas. Seine Amtszeit dauerte vom 7. August 1930 bis zum 23. Oktober 1935. Bennett gehörte der Konservativen Partei an.  Jugend und Studium Richard Bedford Bennett wurde 1870 als ältestes der sechs Kinder von Henry John Bennett (1842–1905) und Henrietta Stiles (1844–1914) geboren. Das Paar war seit dem 22. September 1869 verheiratet und bekam vier seiner Kinder zwischen 1870 und 1876. Den Bennetts gehörte eine Schiffswerft am Hopewell Cape im Südosten New Brunswicks, die Richards Großvater Nathan Murray Bennett gegründet hatte. Henry John Bennett gelang es jedoch nicht, seine wachsende Familie mit den Einkünften aus dem Schiffbau zu ernähren, welche durch die zunehmende Konkurrenz von Dampfmaschinen und die Depression in den 1870er Jahren zurückgingen. Auch seine späteren Tätigkeiten als Händler, Schmied und Landwirt konnten nicht verhindern, dass Richard Bennett und seine Geschwister in relativer Armut aufwuchsen. Ihre Mutter war ein Mitglied der Wesleyan Methodist Church und betonte bei der Erziehung den Wert von harter Arbeit, Nächstenliebe und Genügsamkeit. Nachdem sie eine kleine Erbschaft gemacht hatte, konnte Richard Bennett mit 16 Jahren die Normal School in Fredericton besuchen. Danach arbeitete er als Lehrer in Irishtown nördlich von Moncton. 1888 erlangte er die Lizenz erster Klasse und wurde mit 18 Jahren Leiter einer Schule in Douglastown, einem Stadtteil von Miramichi. Gleichzeitig arbeitete er in seiner Freizeit für das Anwaltsbüro von Lemuel John Tweedie (1849–1917), späterer Premier der Provinz New Brunswick, in Chatham. Auf diese Weise gelang es ihm, genug Geld zu sparen, um im Herbst 1890 ein Jurastudium an der Dalhousie University in Halifax aufnehmen zu können. 1893 schloss er das Studium mit dem Bachelor of Laws ab und im Jahr darauf erhielt er eine Anwaltslizenz für New Brunswick. Umzug nach Alberta und Beginn der politischen Karriere Nach dem Studium kehrte Bennett als Partner in die Praxis in Chatham zurück, die in Tweedie and Bennett umbenannt wurde. 1897 zog er nach Calgary und wurde dort nach Erlangen einer Anwaltslizenz für die Nordwest-Territorien Juniorpartner in der Praxis von James Alexander Lougheed. Dieser war mit der Anstellung einer Empfehlung des Jura-Dekans der Dalhousie University Richard Chapman Weldon (1849–1925) gefolgt. 1907 erhielt Bennett den Titel Kronanwalt (KC) verliehen. Während die noch junge Stadt Calgary zunehmend wuchs, gewann die Anwaltspraxis von Bennett und Lougheed an Kunden und entwickelte sich bis 1914 zu einem erfolgreichen Unternehmen. Bennett betätigte sich außerdem im An- und Verkauf von Land und wurde Teilhaber und Direktor der Calgary Petroleum Products Company des Unternehmers William Stewart Herron. Bennetts politische Karriere begann 1898, als er für den Wahlkreis West Calgary in die Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories (legislative Versammlung der Nordwest-Territorien) gewählt wurde. Dort blieb er bis zu dessen Auflösung 1905 tätig. Nachdem Alberta 1905 Provinz geworden war, wurde er zum Vorsitzenden der neu gegründeten Alberta Conservative Party gewählt. Er kandidierte bei der Wahl zur Legislativversammlung von Alberta für Calgary an, wurde jedoch zunächst nicht gewählt. Dies gelang ihm schließlich 1909 zusammen mit zwei weiteren Mitgliedern der Konservativen, einem Sozialisten und 37 Liberalen. Im Parlament wurde er bald zum Sprecher der zahlenmäßig stark unterlegenen Opposition und einer der wenigen erfolgreichen konservativen Politiker Albertas. Er spielte unter anderem eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Aufdeckung eines Skandals um die Finanzierung der Alberta and Great Waterways Railway, der 1910 zum Rücktritt von Alexander Cameron Rutherford und seines Kabinetts führte. 1911 trat Bennett von seiner Position in der Legislativversammlung von Alberta zurück und wurde für Calgary in das Unterhaus (House of Commons) gewählt. Premierminister war zu dieser Zeit Robert Borden. Bennetts politische Einstellung wird von seinen Biografen als Red Toryism eingestuft. Er setzte sich unter anderem für Sozialleistungen, Gewerkschaften und staatliche Kontrollen in der Wirtschaft ein. In seiner Antrittsrede am 20. November 1911 plädierte er dafür, Vermögensinteressen nicht über die Menschenrechte zu stellen. Es sei die Pflicht der Regierung, dafür zu sorgen, dass dies nicht geschehe. Erster Weltkrieg und Nachkriegszeit Während des Ersten Weltkriegs wurde Bennett aus medizinischen Gründen nicht zum Militärdienst zugelassen. Er engagierte sich als Leiter der Zweigstelle des Roten Kreuzes in Alberta und verwaltete den Canadian Patriotic Fund, der Familien von Soldaten finanziell unterstützte. 1915 ging er als Assistent Bordens nach London, um die britische Regierung zu unterstützen und begleitete ihn bei seinem ersten Besuch der kanadischen Streitkräfte in England und Frankreich. 1916 wurde Bennett Generaldirektor des National Service, der Berichte über die verfügbaren kanadischen Soldaten und Ressourcen erstellte. Im Jahr darauf unterstützte er den Military Service Act, der Kanadier zum Wehrdienst verpflichtete, statt wie bisher auf Freiwillige zu setzen und zur Wehrpflichtkrise führte. Er stellte sich gegen Bordens Idee, Konservative und Liberale in der Unionistischen Partei zu vereinigen. Bei der Wahl 1917 unterstützte er zwar die Konservativen, trat jedoch nicht selbst an. Im Folgejahr verstärkten sich seine Differenzen mit Borden weiter, als dieser ihn aufgrund von Koalitionsabsprachen nicht zum Senator ernannte, sondern stattdessen den Liberalen William James Harmer wählte. Während des Kriegs hatte sich die wirtschaftliche Situation von Bennetts Anwaltsbüro in Calgary verschlechtert, da mehrere Mitarbeiter eingezogen worden waren. Ab 1918 war Bennett zunehmend in die Geschäfte der Streichholz- und Papierfirma E. B. Eddy Company in Hull, Québec, involviert. Die Witwe des Firmeneigentümers, eine langjährige Freundin Bennetts, betraute ihn mit ihren finanziellen Angelegenheiten und vermachte ihm 1921 in ihrem Testament Anteile an der Firma, zu denen nach dem Tod ihres Bruders 1926 weitere hinzukamen, so dass Bennett schließlich die Leitung der Firma übernahm. 1922 trennte er sich nach 25-jähriger geschäftlicher Partnerschaft von Lougheed, mit dessen Arbeit und Entscheidungen er zunehmend unzufrieden war. Die Praxis wurde auf drei Parteien aufgeteilt, wobei Bennetts Büro (Bennett, Hannah, and Sanford) die wichtigsten Kunden mitnehmen konnte. Mitte der 1920er Jahre stand Bennett finanziell gut da, 1924 betrug sein Einkommen 76.897 Dollar, wobei nur 25 Prozent aus seiner Arbeit als Anwalt resultierten. Er verdiente hauptsächlich über Dividenden aus Firmenbeteiligungen, wie an der Alberta Pacific Grain Company, deren Präsident er vorübergehend war, Canada Cement und der E. B. Eddy Company. Er war außerdem ein Direktor der Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in New York und im Aufsichtsrat der Royal Bank of Canada. 1930 lag sein Einkommen bei 262.176 Dollar, mit weiter steigendem Dividendenanteil. Minister und Parteivorsitzender 1920 trat Premierminister Borden zurück und bestimmte Arthur Meighen als seinen Nachfolger. Für den 6. Dezember 1921 setzte Meighen Neuwahlen an und bat Bennett, als sein Justizminister anzutreten. Da sich Kanada nach dem Krieg in einer schweren sozialen und politischen Krise befand, nahm Bennett an, um das Wiederherstellen von Ordnung und Gesetz zu unterstützen. Er wurde am 21. September 1921 vereidigt. Seine Amtszeit dauerte allerdings nur wenige Monate, da die Konservativen bei der Unterhauswahl 1921 unterlagen. Die Konservative Partei errang in der Provinz Alberta keinen Unterhaussitz, Bennett selbst verlor in seinem Wahlkreis Calgary West knapp mit einer Differenz von 16 Stimmen. Bei der Unterhauswahl 1925 trat er erneut an und gewann dieses Mal mit einer komfortablen Mehrheit in Calgary West. Bei dieser Wahl erreichten die Konservativen die Mehrheit, Der Liberale William Lyon Mackenzie King regierte jedoch mit einer Minderheitsregierung weiter, so dass Bennett zunächst nicht den ihm von Meighen erneut in Aussicht gestellten Ministerposten antreten konnte. Durch die King-Byng-Affäre wurde er vom 13. Juli bis 24. September 1926 doch noch als Finanzminister sowie kommissarischer Innenminister und Minister für Bergbau eingesetzt. Diese Regierung der Konservativen endete jedoch nach einem Misstrauensvotum, Auflösung des Parlaments und Neuwahl. Premierminister Meighten, der dabei in seinem Wahlkreis abgewählt wurde, führte bis zum 25. September 1926 die Regierungsgeschäfte weiter. Danach gab er sein Amt an King ab und trat als Parteivorsitzender zurück. Während der folgenden Zeit in der Opposition setzte sich Bennett unter anderem für die Einführung von beitragsfinanzierten Renten und Arbeitslosenversicherung ein. Am 12. Oktober 1927 wurde er auf einer Tagung der Konservativen in Winnipeg zum neuen Parteivorsitzenden gewählt. Im Anschluss legte er wie dabei angekündigt seine Direktorenposten nieder und verkaufte einen Teil der Eddy Company, um möglichst frei von anderen Verpflichtungen zu sein. Er richtete ein zentrales Parteibüro in Ottawa ein, das unter der Leitung von Alexander Duncan McRae (1874–1946) mit 27 Angestellten arbeitete. Da die Finanzen der Partei, ebenso wie der Rückhalt in den Medien und der Bevölkerung, nach der Kriegspolitik der Konservativen sehr schlecht waren, wurde diese Maßnahme hauptsächlich von Senior-Parteimitgliedern finanziert. Von seiner Wahl zum Parteivorsitzenden bis Mai 1930 spendete Bennett rund 500.000 Dollar, ein Fünftel davon ging nach Québec, wo sich die Situation der Konservativen besonders schwierig gestaltete. Mit Bennetts engagierter Arbeit als Oppositionsführer und lokalen Erfolgen konservativer Politiker wie Camillien Houde und Howard Ferguson (1870–1946) verbesserte sich jedoch die Lage bis 1929 markant. Unterstützt von seiner Schwester Mildred (1889–1938) ging Bennett in den Wahlkampf, wobei er mit mehr Erfolg als sein Kontrahent King das neue Medium Radio nutzte. Er reiste zudem durch Kanada, hielt täglich mehrere Reden und legte dabei vom 9. Juni bis 26. Juli rund 14.000 Meilen zurück. Wichtigstes Thema seines Wahlkampfs war die Bekämpfung der zunehmenden Arbeitslosigkeit, das King dagegen vernachlässigte. Bei der Unterhauswahl 1930 gewannen die Konservativen schließlich die absolute Mehrheit der Sitze, während die Liberalen nach vier Jahren Regierungszeit wieder in die Opposition mussten. Premierminister Am 7. August 1930 wurde Bennett Premierminister, Außenminister und Finanzminister sowie Präsident des Kronrats. Er stellte das 15. Kabinett auf, zu deren 19 Mitgliedern unter anderem Thomas Gerow Murphy (1883–1971) als Innenminister, Hugh Guthrie als Justizminister und Robert James Manion als Minister für Eisenbahnen und Kanäle gehörten. Bennett rief sein Kabinett überdurchschnittlich oft zusammen und galt als anspruchsvoller Regierungschef, der nur selten lobte, wie Manion 1932 ihm gegenüber beklagte. Zu seinen ersten Maßnahmen gegen die Auswirkungen der Weltwirtschaftskrise gehörten eine Ausweitung der Schutzzölle auf diverse Produkte, wovon er sich eine Unterstützung der kanadischen Hersteller versprach, sowie ein Unemployment Relief Act, bei dem der Bund 20 Millionen Dollar für die Förderung öffentlicher Projekte auf Bundes- und Provinzebene bereitstellte, wie beispielsweise den Bau von Straßen, Brücken und Kanälen, sowie für die Rückerstattung der Kosten, die Städte und Provinzen durch die Arbeitslosenhilfe entstanden waren. Auf der Reichskonferenz im Herbst 1930 in London bot Bennett dem Vereinigten Königreich und allen anderen Teilen des Britischen Empire eine Vorzugsbehandlung auf dem kanadischen Markt an, wenn diese im Gegenzug Kanada das gleiche gewährten. Dieses Angebot erregte viel Aufsehen in den Medien. Die britische Regierung, welche den freien Handel propagierte, äußerte sich zunächst nicht dazu und lehnte es kurz nach Ende der Konferenz ab. 1931 erließ Bennetts den Unemployment and Farm Relief Act, bei dem 28 Millionen Dollar bereitgestellt wurden, ähnliche Maßnahmen folgten jährlich bis 1935. Die wirtschaftliche Situation Kanadas war weiterhin kritisch, unter anderem durch fallende Weizenpreise. Bennett erhöhte erneut die Zölle und versuchte, die einheimischen Weizenproduzenten zu unterstützen, was 1935 in der Gründung des Canadian Wheat Board mündete. Auf der Reichskonferenz 1932 in Ottawa konnte er trotz Kritik wegen mangelnder Vorbereitung einige Begünstigungen kanadischer Landwirtschaftsprodukte auf dem britischen Markt erreichen, so dass der Export dorthin sich um 60 Prozent erhöhte. Ein anderes Thema, mit dem Bennett sich während seiner Amtszeit auseinandersetzte, war die Regulierung des Rundfunkmarktes in Kanada. Er befürwortete die Gründung staatlicher Radiosender und die Festlegung von Vorschriften für Radioprogramme, um die Bevölkerung mit mehr Bildung statt Unterhaltung zu versorgen. Im Wesentlichen setzte Bennett während seiner Regierungszeit in der Wirtschaftspolitik auf Laissez-faire und hoffte, durch Schutzzölle und Handelsvorteile im Empire die wirtschaftliche Lage Kanadas zu stabilisieren. Damit konnte jedoch die gravierenden Probleme, die mit der Depression einhergingen, nicht lösen. Die Arbeitslosigkeit in Kanada hatte 1933 einen Stand von 27 Prozent erreicht und das Haushaltsdefizit lag bei 150 Millionen Dollar. Erst kurz vor der Unterhauswahl 1935 änderte Bennett seine Strategie und begann in Radiosendungen ab dem 2. Januar 1935 den sogenannten Bennett's New Deal darzulegen. Darin versprach er unter anderem ein fortschrittlicheres Steuersystem, Mindestlöhne, Deckelung der Wochenarbeitszeit, Förderprogramme für die Landwirtschaft und Verbesserungen im Bereich der Sozialversicherungen. In einigen Punkten ähnelte sein Plan dem New Deal von Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mit diesem Richtungswechsel weckte er jedoch Misstrauen in den eigenen Reihen der Konservativen und es gelang ihm nicht, die öffentliche Meinung zu seinen Gunsten zu beeinflussen. Bei der Unterhauswahl im Oktober gewannen die Liberalen die absolute Mehrheit der Sitze und die Konservativen gingen in die Opposition. Am 22. Oktober endete Bennetts Amtszeit als Premierminister. Bis zum 6. Juli 1938 blieb er Parteivorsitzender und aktiver Führer der Opposition. Dann trat er zurück, vorwiegend aus gesundheitlichen Gründen. Bennett litt unter Herzproblemen und Übergewicht. Zudem starb im gleichen Jahr seine ihm nahestehende Schwester Mildred, mit der er bis zu ihrer Hochzeit 1931 zusammengewohnt hatte, im Alter von 49 Jahren an Brustkrebs. Nach Bennetts Rücktritt übernahm Manion den Parteivorsitz. Letzte Jahre in Großbritannien Nach seinem Rücktritt entschied Bennett, Kanada zu verlassen, unter anderem um dem Druck der Öffentlichkeit zu entgehen. Im August 1938 reiste er nach England und übernahm dort ab dem 1. November das Anwesen Juniper Hill in der Nähe von Box Hill in Surrey. Nach einigen Renovierungsarbeiten und Klärung letzter Angelegenheiten kündigte er am 28. Januar 1939 seinen Sitz im Unterhaus für Calgary West und verließ am gleichen Abend endgültig Kanada mit dem Schiff Montclare von Halifax aus. In England wurde er Mitglied verschiedener Organisationen und blieb als populärer Sprecher aktiv. Für die Unterstützung von Lord Beaverbrook und seines Ministeriums für Flugzeugproduktion offerierte Winston Churchill Bennett den Adelstitel Viscount Bennett of Mickleham, Hopewell and Calgary sowie einen Sitz im House of Lords (1941–1947). Bennetts Gesundheit verschlechterte sich zunehmend, 1944 wurde zusätzlich Diabetes bei ihm diagnostiziert. Am Abend des 26. Juni 1947 nahm er ein heißes Bad und starb dabei an einem Herzinfarkt. Er wurde am nächsten Morgen tot aufgefunden und auf dem St. Michael's Churchyard bei Mickleham in Surrey beerdigt. Am 4. Juli fand ein Gedenkgottesdienst in Westminster Abbey statt. Bennett war nie verheiratet und hinterließ keine Kinder. |
G;|Martin Mutschmann (* 9. März 1879 in Hirschberg; † 14. Februar 1947 in Moskau) war ein deutscher Unternehmer, nationalsozialistischer Politiker und NSDAP-Gauleiter von Sachsen von 1925 bis 1945. Ab 1930 war er Mitglied des Reichstags, ab 1933 Reichsstatthalter in Sachsen und zudem ab 1935 sächsischer Ministerpräsident.       Herkunft, Ausbildung und Berufstätigkeit bis zum Kriegsende Das mangelnde Arbeitsplatzangebot in dem ländlich geprägten Hirschberg zwang die Familie, in die Textil- und Spitzenmetropole Plauen zu ziehen. Dort besuchte Mutschmann ab 1885 die evangelisch-lutherische Bürgerschule, von 1894 bis 1896 die Plauener Handelsschule und begann zugleich eine Ausbildung zum Stickermeister. Vom Lagerchef und Abteilungsleiter in verschiedenen Spitzen- und Wäschefabriken in Plauen, Herford und Köln stieg Mutschmann bald zum Geschäftsführer eines mittelständischen Unternehmens auf. Seinen Militärdienst absolvierte er von 1901 bis 1903 beim 3. Unter-Elsässischen Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 138 in Straßburg. 1907 gründete der 28-jährige Mutschmann zusammen mit Karl Eisentraut die Plauener Spitzenfabrik Mutschmann & Eisentraut in der Bärenstraße 61 mit anfangs etwa 25 bis 30 Beschäftigten. In den Folgejahren beteiligte er sich an weiteren Regionalunternehmen, so dass er etwa 500 Arbeiter beschäftigte. Der jährliche Umsatz inklusive Exportgeschäft belief sich umgerechnet auf bis zu eine Million Reichsmark. 1912/1913 erlitt die Plauener Spitzenbranche einen weltweiten Absatzeinbruch. Begünstigt wurde dieser durch die Balkankriege, die hohen Zollschranken in den Vereinigten Staaten sowie durch einen Wechsel des herrschenden Modetrends. Auch die Spitzenfabrik Mutschmann & Eisentraut blieb davon nicht verschont. Die Plauener Spitzenunternehmer einschließlich Mutschmann fanden in den aus Osteuropa stammenden Juden („Ostjuden“), die in der Spitzenbranche Fuß gefasst hatten, schnell ihren Sündenbock, und forderten darauf im Verbund mit der Ortsgruppe der antisemitischen Deutschsozialen Partei schärfere Maßnahmen gegen diese „jüdischen Ramscher“. Da der Oberbürgermeister Julius Dehne nicht auf diese Forderungen reagierte, kündigte die Gegenseite ihrerseits „Selbsthilfe“ an, die sich am 2. und 3. August 1914 im Ramscherkrieg entlud. In diesem Zusammenhang erfolgte Mutschmanns erste öffentliche antisemitische Entgleisung. Antisemitische Ausbrüche Mutschmanns hatte es jedoch bereits vor 1914 gegeben. Der spätere Reichswirtschaftsminister Walther Funk, als Stickermeister und Geschäftsführer eines Spitzengeschäfts in Plauen ein persönlicher Bekannter Mutschmanns, erinnerte sich, dass Mutschmann sich bei gelegentlichen Judenhetzen besonders hervorgetan habe. Außerdem wäre er wichtigen jüdischen Kunden mit Unterwürfigkeit begegnet, gegenüber ärmeren jüdischen Händlern recht brutal gewesen. In diesen Tagen verübte eine über den Kriegsausbruch erregte und aufgehetzte Volksmenge in Plauen Gewalttätigkeiten und Bedrohungen gegenüber jüdischen Geschäftsinhabern. Die Eskalation konnte nur durch ein massives Polizeiaufgebot unterdrückt werden, so wurde etwa ein Geschäftshaus durch Militär unter Verkündung des Standrechts bewacht. Laut Funk wurde Mutschmann in diesem Zusammenhang als Inspirator der Judenpogrome in der Plauener Forststraße benannt, in der eine größere Anzahl jüdischer Geschäftsleute wohnte. Obwohl Dehme die Pogrome auf das Schärfste verurteilte, kam es zu keiner Anklage. Mutschmann selbst wurde am 4. August 1914 zum Militärdienst einberufen und dem Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment 133 zugeteilt. Das Regiment war zunächst in der Festung Posen stationiert und blieb bis Kriegsende an der Ostfront. Zu einem unbekannten Zeitpunkt muss Mutschmann dieses Regiment verlassen haben, da er im April 1916 an der Westfront vor Verdun verwundet wurde. Im Dezember 1916 konnte er als kriegsuntauglich eingestuft nach Plauen zurückkehren, im Rang eines Gefreiten und als Inhaber des Eisernen Kreuzes II. Klasse sowie der Friedrich-August-Medaille. Mutschmann selbst gab dazu später an, dass er aufgrund einer chronischen Nierenentzündung aus der Armee entlassen wurde. Darüber hinaus berichtet Funk, dass Mutschmann zusammen mit seiner Frau seine Rückberufung nach Plauen sowie die Einziehung seines im Geschäft verbliebenen Partners Eisentraut anonym bei Behörden beantragt haben soll. Eisentraut wurde dann tatsächlich gegen Kriegsende zum Militärdienst eingezogen und fiel. Damit stieg Mutschmann zum alleinigen Geschäftsführer der Firma auf, die er bis Kriegsende mit Schiebergeschäften vor dem Bankrott bewahrt haben soll. Weimarer Republik 1919 trat Mutschmann dem antisemitischen Deutschvölkischen Schutz- und Trutzbund und 1922 der NSDAP mit der Mitgliedsnummer 5346 bei. In den Nachkriegswirren verschmolz Mutschmanns Antisemitismus mit dem des Anti-Marxismus, dessen Gründe in der neuen politischen Situation in Sachsen zu suchen sind. So wurde im März 1919 der aus dem jüdischen Bürgertum stammende Georg Gradnauer zum sächsischen Ministerpräsidenten ernannt. Die folgenden Übergriffe des Rätekommunisten Max Hoelz im Vogtland brachten Mutschmann zur Überzeugung, dass der Marxismus sowie das Judentum den „Niedergang Deutschlands“ bedeuten würden. Der Sieg der roten Arbeiterbewegung in Sachsen und die ökonomischen Probleme im Nachkriegsdeutschland förderten Mutschmanns politische Radikalisierung. In der in Sachsen 1921 gegründeten NSDAP machte Mutschmann rasch Karriere. Profitieren konnte er dabei von seinen unternehmerischen Vernetzungen. Dabei drängte er den ersten Vorsitzenden der sächsischen NSDAP Fritz Tittmann aus der Führung und anschließend ganz aus Sachsen. Karrierefördernd wirkten sich Mutschmanns frühe Verbindungen zu Adolf Hitler aus, den er 1924 in der Haft in Landsberg besuchte und finanziell förderte. Während des Verbotes der NSDAP gründete Mutschmann in Sachsen den Völkischsozialen Block. Nach der erneuten Gründung der NSDAP wurde Mutschmann von Hitler im Juni 1925 zum Gauleiter für Sachsen ernannt und überführte den Block in die Partei. Den Aufbau der sächsischen NSDAP delegierte Mutschmann von Plauen aus, wo sich der Sitz der Gauleitung befand. Wahlkämpfe finanzierte er vermutlich mit den Erlösen seiner Firma. Mit angeblichen weiteren großzügigen Geldspenden sicherte er sich eine Karriere in der NSDAP. Der Gau Sachsen wurde nach der Mitgliederzahl einer der größten der NSDAP. Im Sommer 1930 gründete Mutschmann die Tageszeitung Der Freiheitskampf. 1930 ging Mutschmanns Firma aufgrund der Weltwirtschaftskrise in Konkurs. Bei der Reichstagswahl 1930 wurde Mutschmann Reichstagsabgeordneter für den Wahlkreis 30 Chemnitz-Zwickau. In der dortigen NSDAP-Fraktion übernahm er das Sachgebiet Handel und Industrie und gehörte dem interfraktionellen Reichstagsausschuss für Handelspolitik an. In Sachsen unterhielt Mutschmann freundschaftliche Kontakte zu Gregor Strasser. Im Juli 1932 ernannte dieser Mutschmann zum Landesinspekteur der neu geschaffenen NSDAP-Reichsinspektion. Innerhalb der sächsischen NSDAP war Manfred von Killinger Mutschmanns schärfster Rivale. Killinger, seit 1929 Chef der sächsischen SA und Fraktionsführer in Sachsen, stieg 1932 zum Inspekteur Ost der Obersten SA-Führung auf. Zeit des Nationalsozialismus Persönliche Machtergreifung (1933–1935) Nach der Machtergreifung im Januar 1933 bezichtigte Mutschmann seinen Förderer Strasser öffentlich als Juden. Strasser war im Dezember 1932 von all seinen Ämtern zurückgetreten (siehe Strasser-Krise). Mutschmann hatte Hitler gegenüber die „Strasser-Verschwörung“ aufgedeckt und damit sein Vertrauensverhältnis zu ihm gestärkt. Nach dem Verlust des Titels des Landesinspekteurs von Sachsen und Thüringen infolge des organisatorischen Umbaus der Reichsparteistruktur wurde Mutschmann am 5. Mai 1933 neben seinem Posten als Gauleiter der NSDAP auch Reichsstatthalter von Sachsen. Zwischen ihm und dem aus dem Freikorps stammenden redegewandten SA-Führer und nun sächsischen Ministerpräsidenten Manfred von Killinger verschärfte sich der Machtkampf um die Führungspositionen innerhalb Sachsens. Nachdem Mutschmann von Amts wegen versuchte, die Geschäfte des Ministerpräsidenten zu kontrollieren, beendete der „Röhm-Putsch“ im Sommer 1934 den Zwist. Mutschmann erwies sich als Sieger, Killinger wurde zunächst in ein Konzentrationslager verbracht und später im Auswärtigen Dienst „abserviert“. Anfang 1935 ernannte Hitler Mutschmann zum Ministerpräsidenten, der damit die Position des Partei-Gauleiters, des Reichsstatthalters und des Ministerpräsidenten in einer Person vereinigte. Darüber hinaus sicherte sich Mutschmann, seit 1933 Ehrenführer der SA bei der SA-Standarte 100, mit Übernahme der Funktion eines SA-Obergruppenführers die Loyalität von Killingers ehemaliger Parteiarmee. Politisches Programm Als Reichsstatthalter förderte Mutschmann die Deutsche Arbeitsfront (DAF) nachhaltig. Als der DAF Ende 1933 die von den Gewerkschaften geraubten Geldsummen langsam ausgingen, entwickelte sie Modelle zur weiteren Bereicherung. Sie zielten auf eine karteimäßige Erfassung aller Arbeiter, um die Unternehmer zu veranlassen, den DAF-Beitrag zusammen mit den Steuern vom Lohn vorweg abzuziehen, sowie von allen im Betrieb Beschäftigten eine DAF-Mitgliedschaft zu verlangen. Mutschmann war der Initiator für diesen direkten Abzug der DAF-Beiträge vom Lohn. Mutschmann war ein besonders aktiver Verfechter der nationalsozialistischen Ideologie. Speziellen Hass entwickelte er gegen die Vertreter des demokratischen Systems und Juden. Er setzte alle Kraft für deren Vertreibung oder Vernichtung ein. Dies galt auch Menschen, die er persönlich kannte. So ließ er Hermann Liebmann, den ehemaligen sächsischen Innenminister und SPD-Vorsitzenden von Leipzig, 1933 in Haft nehmen und sorgte dafür, dass er ständig misshandelt wurde. Liebmann starb direkt nach der Entlassung an den Folgen dieser Folterungen im September 1935. Nach der Machtergreifung konnte sich der Antisemitismus frei entfalten. Zusammen mit Julius Streicher hetzte Mutschmann für „judenreine“ Dresdener Wohnbezirke. Im Dresdener Landtagsgebäude machte Mutschmann zusammen mit SS-Männern und vorgehaltener Pistole Jagd auf NS-abtrünnige Parteigenossen und Mitglieder anderer Parteien. Der SPD-Fraktionsvorsitzende Karl Böchel musste nach Misshandlungen in ein Krankenhaus eingeliefert werden. Ein jüdischer Parlamentsjournalist überlebte Mutschmanns Jagd knapp. Ebenso wenig scheute sich Mutschmann, das mörderische Handeln der Wachmannschaften der ersten Konzentrationslager, z. B. die des KZ Hohnstein, zu legitimieren und diese sogar anzufeuern. Ob Mutschmann direkten oder indirekten Einfluss auf die Ermordung von Hermann Liebmann, Eugen Fritsch und Julius Brandeis hatte, bleibt ungeklärt. Als Personen der Wachmannschaften des KZ Hohnstein wegen der dort vorgefallenen Morde und Misshandlungen vor dem Landgericht Dresden angeklagt wurden, setzte sich Mutschmann erfolgreich bei Hitler für die vorzeitige Entlassung der Täter ein. Seine untersetzte Gestalt, sein uncharismatisches, mitunter jähzorniges Auftreten sowie seine sächsische Mundart bildeten eine Grundlage für Spötteleien und Karikaturdarstellungen, gegen die er sich vehement wehrte. Mutschmann galt als selbstherrlich und egozentrisch. Er wurde vom Volk als König Mu(h) bezeichnet. Auf sein Betreiben hin galt aber paradoxerweise Sächsisch als unheldisch. Mutschmann war Jäger und bekleidete das Amt des Gaujägermeisters für das Land Sachsen. Im Tharandter Wald wurde auf seinen Befehl hin im Jagdschloss Grillenburg 1936 der Sächsische Jägerhof eingerichtet und dazu 1938/39 das Neue Jägerhaus als Gästehaus gebaut. Weil Mutschmann dieses Gebäude mitunter auch gern privat nutzte, wurde es im Volksmund ebenso wie auch sein Dresdner Wohnsitz als „Mutschmann-Villa“ betitelt. Zweiter Weltkrieg Als der Zweite Weltkrieg begann, wurde Mutschmann zusätzlich zu seinen zahlreichen Posten auch noch Reichsverteidigungskommissar und war damit maßgeblich für die Umsetzung des Krankenmordprogramms der T4 in Sachsen in der NS-Tötungsanstalt Sonnenstein verantwortlich. Vorher war er schon für die Umstellung aller sächsischen Industriebetriebe auf die Produktion von kriegswichtigen Gütern zuständig gewesen. Während des Krieges vernachlässigte er den Bau von Luftschutzbunkern, ließ sich allerdings 1943 an seinem Dresdner Wohnsitz Comeniusstraße 32 einen Privatbunker errichten. Im Dezember 1944 erklärte er Dresden zum Verteidigungsbereich. Nach den Luftangriffen vom 13. und 14. Februar 1945, bei dem seine Villa ausgebombt worden war, führte Mutschmann die Geschäfte als Reichsstatthalter von Sachsen in Grillenburg aus und die des Gauleiters in seinem provisorischen Befehlsstand im Lockwitzgrund bei Dresden. Einen Unterstützer dieser Idee fand der Gauleiter bei Generalfeldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner, dessen Heeresgruppe Mitte auf dem Gebiet Sachsens und Böhmens aufmarschiert war. Ab März 1945 wurde Mutschmann der Korvettenkapitän Werner Vogelsang als militärischer Berater zur Seite gestellt, der zugleich Stellvertreter des Gauleiters wurde. Noch im April 1945 befahl Mutschmann Schüler zum Stellungsbau in der Dresdner Altstadt und erklärte am 14. April 1945 Dresden zur Festung. Am 17. April 1945, als die US-Armee zum Sturm auf Leipzig ansetzte und die Rote Armee in Ostsachsen stand, rief er zum Widerstand auf und zur Fortsetzung des Kampfes „bis zum Letzten“. Jede Zuwiderhandlung gegen diese Order, z. B. das Heraushängen von weißen Tüchern, wertete Mutschmann als Landesverrat, der mit dem Tod bestraft wurde. Bis Kriegsende gab es in Sachsen noch Dutzende derartiger Todesurteile gegen eigene Soldaten und Zivilisten. Ende April 1945 betraute Mutschmann seinen Stellvertreter mit der Aufstellung von Widerstandsgruppen nach Werwolf-Methoden, die den Kampf verdeckt weiterführen sollten. Als Vogelsang diese Idee für nicht realisierbar hielt, beschimpfte ihn Mutschmann als „Kapitulanten“. Am 1. Mai 1945, dem Tag der Arbeit, demonstrierte Mutschmann in Meißen an seinem letzten öffentlichen Auftritt erneut Kampfbereitschaft. Vier Tage später versammelte er im Lockwitzgrund seine Kreisleiter, denen er u. a. die Vernichtung aller wichtigen Dokumente verordnete. Außerdem befahl er, die Ordnung bis zum letzten Tag aufrechtzuerhalten und die Versorgung der Flüchtlinge zu klären. Drei Tage später rief er im Freiheitskampf dazu auf, nicht eher zu ruhen, bis der „verhasste und mitleidlose Feind vernichtet oder vertrieben worden“ sei. Flucht und Verurteilung Am 7. und 8. Mai 1945 wurde Dresden kampflos von der Roten Armee besetzt und Mutschmann floh am 8. Mai mit seinem Vertrauten Werner Schmiedel, NS-Wirtschaftsführer und Direktor der staatlichen Aktiengesellschaft Sächsische Werke (ASW), aus der Stadt. Am Morgen des 9. Mai wurden sie von Einheiten der Roten Armee in Glashütte überrascht. Beide konnten sich jedoch in die nahen Wälder retten. Einen Tag später machten sie sich zu Fuß auf den Weg nach Grillenburg. Da dieser Ort bereits von der Roten Armee besetzt war, versteckten sie sich drei Tage in einer Jagdhütte außerhalb des Ortes. Am Morgen des 14. Mai entschlossen sich die beiden Männer, der Gauregierung und seiner Frau in das 90 Kilometer entfernte Oberwiesenthal zu folgen. Dass der 66-jährige physisch schwer gezeichnete Mutschmann diese Strecke binnen eines Tages zu Fuß zurückgelegt hat, ist zu bezweifeln. Vielmehr geht der Historiker Mike Schmeitzner davon aus, dass die beiden Männer auf ihrer Flucht teilweise ein Fortbewegungsmittel genutzt haben und der Fußmarsch von Mutschmann später nur ausgesagt wurde, um Helfer zu schützen. Am 15. Mai erreichten sie den Ort, trafen aber niemanden an. Mutschmanns persönlicher Referent Eugen Schramm hatte sich schon am 10. Mai aus Angst vor einer sowjetischen Verhaftung per Kopfschuss getötet. Am gleichen Tag beging die mitgereiste Stenotypistin der Gauregierung ebenfalls Suizid. Am 12. Mai wurde auch Martin Hammitzsch mit Kopfschuss tot aufgefunden. Grohé und Mutschmanns Frau hingegen flüchteten weiter. Seine Frau floh erst in Richtung Tellerhäuser und dann weiter nach Rittersgrün, weshalb sie am nächsten Tag in das 5 Kilometer entfernte Tellerhäuser weiterzogen und dort in einem abgelegenen Haus unterkamen. Am frühen Abend des 16. Mai 1945 erfuhr der erst vor wenigen Tagen eingesetzte Oberwiesenthaler Bürgermeister Hermann Klopfer durch einen anonymen Anruf aus Tellerhäuser, dass sich Mutschmann im Haus des Kohlehändlers Kaufmann aufhalte. Am Abend wurde das Haus umstellt und die beiden wurden verhaftet. Am 17. Mai wurde Mutschmann in Annaberg verhört und auf dem Marktplatz öffentlich zur Schau gestellt. Die Anprangerung unter Duldung der sowjetischen Truppen wurde durch eine Rede des KPD-Bürgermeisters Max Schmitt begleitet, in der er zum Ausdruck brachte, dass der Verbrecher endlich gefasst sei. Danach wurde Mutschmann über Chemnitz nach Moskau in das Gefängnis Lubjanka gebracht. Dort wurde er am 22. Juni 1946 vor einem Militärgericht angeklagt, am 30. Januar 1947 zum Tode verurteilt und am 14. Februar 1947 im Gefängnis erschossen. |
G;|Monica Seles (serbisch Monika Seleš/Моника Селеш, ungarisch Mónika Szeles; * 2. Dezember 1973 in Novi Sad, SFR Jugoslawien) ist eine ehemalige jugoslawische und US-amerikanische Tennisspielerin. Sie besitzt seit 2007 auch die ungarische Staatsbürgerschaft. Seles gewann 53 Turniere im Einzel, darunter neun Grand-Slam-Turniere, und sechs Turniere im Doppel. Monica Seles, deren Karriere 1993 durch ein Attentat in Hamburg überschattet wurde, zählt zu den besten und erfolgreichsten Tennisspielerinnen aller Zeiten.   Aufstieg Monica Seles kommt aus einer Familie ungarischer Abstammung. Mit sechs Jahren begann sie, angeleitet von Vater Karoly, mit dem Tennissport. Das erste Turnier gewann sie mit neun Jahren. Aus dieser Zeit ist von ihr selbst die Anekdote überliefert, dass sie, die noch nicht in der Lage war, bei Wettkampfspielen den Spielstand selbst zu erfassen, von Zeit zu Zeit ihrem Vater zugerufen habe: „Gewinne ich?“ 1985, mit elf Jahren, gewann Seles die Orange Bowl in Miami, eines der weltweit bedeutendsten Nachwuchsturniere. Dabei erweckte das beidhändig spielende Mädchen das Interesse des US-amerikanischen Tenniscoachs Nick Bollettieri. 1986 zog Familie Seles in die Vereinigten Staaten, wo Monica für zwei Jahre unter Bolletieri an seiner Akademie ihr Spiel weiter verbesserte. Bolletieri war von ihrer ungewöhnlichen Spielweise von Anfang an überzeugt. So ließ er eigens für sie einen von hohen Wänden umgebenen Platz errichten, um so ungestört, geschützt vor neugierigen Blicken der potenziellen Konkurrenz, Seles’ Powerspiel zu entwickeln. Wie gut diese Taktik aufging, erwies sich bereits zwei Jahre später, als Seles im Alter von 15 Jahren Profispielerin wurde. Im Mai desselben Jahres gewann sie in Houston ihren ersten großen Titel, als sie im Finale die Weltranglistendritte Chris Evert schlug. Für viele gilt Seles als die eigentliche Begründerin des modernen Power-Tennis. Einen Monat später erreichte sie bei ihrem ersten Grand-Slam-Turnier gleich das Halbfinale der French Open, gegen die Weltranglistenerste Steffi Graf. Seles beendete ihr erstes Profijahr auf dem sechsten Platz in der Weltrangliste. 1990: Durchbruch Das Jahr 1990 brachte für Seles den Durchbruch. Bereits im Mai bezwang sie bei den German Open in Berlin erstmals Steffi Graf. Diese dominierte seit Jahren das Welttennis wie kaum eine andere Spielerin zuvor und war in 66 aufeinander folgenden Partien unbesiegt. Zwei Wochen später gelang Seles die Wiederholung des Triumphs. Bei den French Open besiegte sie in einem umkämpften Finale erneut die Weltranglistenerste, die im Tiebreak des ersten Satzes vier Satzbälle nicht hatte verwerten können. Seles gewann in zwei Sätzen. Mit 16 Jahren und 6 Monaten ist sie bis heute die jüngste French-Open-Siegerin aller Zeiten. 1991–1993: Weltranglistenerste und Dominanz Das Jahr 1991 war das erste von zwei Jahren, in denen Seles das Welttennis dominierte. Sie begann im Januar mit dem Gewinn der Australian Open, wo sie bei ihrer ersten Teilnahme im Finale Jana Novotná schlug. Im März gelang es ihr, Steffi Graf als Weltranglistenerste zu entthronen. Im Juni verteidigte sie ihren French-Open-Titel gegen Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, die Siegerin von 1989. Während der Wimbledon Championships nahm sich Seles überraschend eine sechswöchige Auszeit. Im September erreichte sie dann auf Anhieb das Finale ihrer ersten US Open, in dem sie Martina Navrátilová besiegte. Auch das Jahr 1992 verlief ähnlich erfolgreich: Seles konnte ihre drei Grand-Slam-Titel verteidigen. Einen Höhepunkt bildete das Endspiel in Roland Garros, wo sie erneut der wieder erstarkten Graf gegenüberstand und diese in einem legendären Match mit 10:8 im dritten Satz niederrang. Seles erreichte auch erstmals das Wimbledon-Finale, unterlag auf Rasen aber deutlich ihrer Vorgängerin; Graf siegte mit 6:2 und 6:1. Zwischen Januar 1991 bis Februar 1993 gewann Seles 22 Turniere und erreichte 33 Mal das Finale – bei insgesamt 34 gespielten Turnieren. Sie kam dabei auf die Bilanz von 159 Siegen bei 12 Niederlagen (92,9 %). Bei Grand-Slam-Turnieren stand ihre Quote bei 55 Siegen und einer Niederlage. Innerhalb der ersten vier Jahre auf der Tour (1989–1992) erreichte sie bei 30 Turniersiegen eine Siegquote von 231:25 Spielen (90,2 %). Nur Chris Evert kann mit 91,4 % und 34 Turniersiegen zwischen 1971 und 1974 auf einen besseren Karrierestart zurückblicken. Seles ging als stärkste Spielerin in das Jahr 1993. Im Januar startete sie erneut mit einem Titelgewinn bei den Australian Open. Sie schlug Graf in drei Sätzen und verbuchte in Down Under ihren dritten Titel in Folge. Sportliche Rivalität bis 1993 mit Steffi Graf Die ständige Rivalität zwischen Steffi Graf und Monica Seles zwischen 1989 und 1993 gehört zu den großen Kapiteln des Tennissports. Die meist hart umkämpften Duelle der beiden in ihrer Persönlichkeit und ihrem Spielsystem so unterschiedlichen Athletinnen markierten Höhepunkte in beiden Karrieren und führten das Damentennis auf ein neues Niveau. In ihren Auseinandersetzungen trafen nicht nur sehr unterschiedliche Persönlichkeiten aufeinander: Hier die introvertierte stille Graf, die den Medienrummel scheute und sich anfangs jedes Lächeln verkniff. Dort die extrovertierte Seles, die ihre Gegnerinnen zur Begrüßung als 15-Jährige mit Rosensträußen beehrte, um sie dann vom Platz zu fegen. Auch die so unterschiedlichen Spielsysteme nährten die große Rivalität: Hier die schnörkellos spielende, schnelle Graf mit ihrer gewaltigen Vorhand und der den Ball tief eingrabenden unterschnittenen Rückhand. Dort Monica Seles, die extrem stöhnend jeden Ball mit maximaler Härte spielte und die Gegnerinnen mit raffiniertem Winkelspiel aus dem Platz zwang. Der absolute Anspruch beider, die Beste sein zu wollen, machte die Aufeinandertreffen der beiden Dominatorinnen zu emotional aufgeladenen Sternstunden des Tennissports. Bis zum Erscheinen der jungen Monica Seles hatte Graf das Welttennis beherrscht und als nahezu unbesiegbar gegolten. Dies hatte sich 1990 im zweiten Jahr von Seles auf der Tour geändert, in der Graf erstmals unterlag und in den Duellen sieglos blieb. 1991, als es bei Graf insgesamt kriselte und sie für ihre Verhältnisse auch ungewöhnlich oft gegen andere Spielerinnen verlor, hatte Seles die Führung in der Weltrangliste übernommen und drei der vier Grand-Slam-Turniere gewonnen, wobei sich beide in keinem einzigen dieser Endspiele gegenüberstanden. Graf hatte Seles in den einzigen beiden Aufeinandertreffen des Jahres bei zwei kleineren Turnieren besiegt, jedoch – mit Ausnahme des Sieges in Wimbledon – kein anderes Major-Endspiel erreicht. Auch 1992 gewann Seles drei Grand-Slam-Titel. Beide standen sich im Verlaufe des Jahres zweimal gegenüber: bei den French Open siegte Seles über Graf mit 10:8 im dritten Satz, in Wimbledon gewann die Deutsche. Seles revanchierte sich Anfang 1993 mit einem Dreisatzsieg bei den Australian Open. Im April 1993 wies die Gesamtbilanz sechs Siege für Graf und vier für Seles aus, wobei Seles sechs der letzten acht Grand-Slam-Turniere gewonnen hatte. Anfang 1993 deutete sich eine langjährige sportliche Rivalität an, die in ihrer Brisanz und Spannung ein Versprechen für die Zukunft zu sein schien; ein Kampf um die Vormachtstellung im Damentennis, der eine ähnliche Qualität versprach, wie man sie früher im Zweikampf zwischen Chris Evert und Martina Navratilova erlebt hatte. Doch die hoch gespannten Erwartungen fanden im April des Jahres 1993 ein unvorhergesehenes, jähes Ende, über das die frühere Weltklassespielerin Pam Shriver sagte: „Man hat uns um das Duell einer Generation betrogen.“ 1993–1995: Attentat und Rückzug von der Tour Das Jahr 1993 hatte für Monica Seles mit der erfolgreichen Titelverteidigung bei den Australian Open begonnen. Ein Turniersieg in Chicago gegen Martina Navrátilová folgte. Doch es war etwas später Altmeisterin Navrátilová, die Seles’ 34 Siege umfassende Serie im Finale der Paris Indoor Championships beendete. Eine hartnäckige Virusinfektion zwang die Weltranglistenerste im Anschluss zum Verzicht auf die Turniere von Indian Wells, Miami, Hilton Head und Barcelona. Ihre erfolgreiche Rückkehr auf die Tour feierte sie beim Tennisturnier in Hamburg. Am 30. April 1993 wurde Monica Seles während ihrer Viertelfinalbegegnung gegen Magdalena Maleewa von dem psychisch gestörten Günter Parche, einem damals 38-jährigen deutschen Fan ihrer stärksten Kontrahentin Steffi Graf, beim Seitenwechsel in den Rücken gestochen. Seles bestritt nach dem Attentat zwei Jahre lang keine Profispiele mehr. Wenige Wochen später übernahm Graf wieder die Führung in der Weltrangliste. Nachrichten über eine mögliche Rückkehr von Seles tauchten immer wieder auf. Zwar waren die physischen Verletzungen des Messerattentats schon bald verheilt, doch anders verhielt es sich mit der Psyche: Seles litt unter einer posttraumatischen Belastungsstörung und in der Folge unter depressiven Verstimmungen. Comeback-Ankündigungen folgten immer wieder Absagen. Am 17. Mai 1994 wurde Seles US-Bürgerin. 1995: Das Comeback 1995 verdichteten sich die Anzeichen für das Comeback. Seles war zu Gast bei den French Open, präsentierte sich als Zuschauerin der Spiele erstmals wieder der Öffentlichkeit und deutete eine mögliche Rückkehr auf die Tour an. Den ersten Schritt auf dem Weg zum Comeback als Profispielerin machte sie am 29. Juli 1995 in Atlantic City mit einem Schaukampf gegen Navrátilová. Um Seles einen fairen Wiedereinstieg ins Profigeschehen zu ermöglichen, hatte die WTA ihre Regularien geändert. Mit Zustimmung der Weltranglistenersten Steffi Graf wurde die Neu-US-Amerikanerin für die ersten sechs gespielten Turniere als Co-Nummer 1 im Ranking geführt. Sinn der Regelung war es, dass Seles ohne Druck Ranglistenpunkte sammeln konnte, aus denen sich ihre tatsächliche Weltranglistenposition dann ergeben sollte. Im August feierte Seles ein furioses Comeback bei den Canadian Open in Toronto. Sie gab im Turnierverlauf keinen Satz und nur 14 Spiele ab und bezwang unter anderem Gabriela Sabatini mit 6:1 und 6:0. Auch bei den darauf folgenden US Open setzte sich ihr Siegeszug zunächst fort. Sie besiegte Anke Huber, Jana Novotná und Conchita Martínez und zog in das mit Spannung erwartete Finale gegen Steffi Graf ein. Seles unterlag in einem hochklassigen und von starken Emotionen geprägten engen Match mit 6:7 (6:8), 6:0 und 3:6. Im Anschluss stoppten Verletzungsprobleme die Fortsetzung von Seles’ bemerkenswerter Rückkehr. Aufgrund von Überanstrengungserscheinungen im linken Knie und Fuß war sie gezwungen, auf die geplanten Starts in Oakland und bei den WTA Championships zu verzichten. 1996–1998: Neunter Grand-Slam-Titel, Verletzungspausen, Tod des Vaters Seles konnte nicht wieder an die überragende Form und die alten Erfolge anknüpfen. Chronische Verletzungsprobleme und der Tod des Vaters im Frühjahr 1998 warfen sie immer wieder zurück. Bis zu den Australian Open 1996 schien ihre Karriere nahtlos dort anzuschließen, wo sie zwei Jahre zuvor so abrupt unterbrochen worden war. Seles gewann das Vorbereitungsturnier in Sydney gegen Lindsay Davenport und wenig später in Melbourne auch ihr insgesamt neuntes Grand-Slam-Turnier. Sie blieb damit bei ihrem insgesamt vierten Start in Australien ungeschlagen. Mit den Spielen, die sie im folgenden Jahr bei den Australian Open gewinnen sollte, brach sie den 73 Jahre alten Rekord der Tennislegende Suzanne Lenglen. Sie war seit ihrem ersten Auftreten dort insgesamt 33 Spiele in Folge unbesiegt geblieben. Auf dem Weg zum Titel 1996 besiegte sie Spielerinnen wie Anke Huber, Conchita Martínez und Jana Novotná. Seles kehrte in die Top Ten der Weltrangliste zurück. Eine Schulterentzündung zwang sie dann zu einer erneuten Verletzungspause, die bis in den späten Mai andauerte. Bei ihrer ersten Rückkehr zu den French Open seit dem Attentat erreichte Seles das Viertelfinale, in dem sie Jana Novotná mit 6:7 und 3:6 unterlag. Im Anschluss gelang ihr mit dem Sieg beim Wimbledon-Vorbereitungsturnier in Eastbourne der erste Titelgewinn auf Rasen. Weniger erfolgreich verlief ihre Rückkehr nach Wimbledon, wo sie bereits in der zweiten Runde der unbekannten Slowakin Katarína Studeníková unterlag. Bei den US Open konnte Seles erneut ins Finale einziehen, in dem sie wie im Vorjahr Steffi Graf mit 5:7 und 4:6 unterlag. Im weiteren Verlauf des Jahres gewann Seles die Turniere in Montreal und Tokio. Dann aber folgten elf Monate Wartezeit. 1997 blieb sie bis zum August sieglos. Eine Fingerverletzung zwang sie zur Absage der Frühjahrsturniere. Dann besiegte sie im Finale von Manhattan Beach die Weltranglistenerste Lindsay Davenport und triumphierte eine Woche später in Toronto. Es war ihr 40. Sieg bei einem WTA-Turnier. Weitere Finalteilnahmen in Miami und Hilton Head sowie der Halbfinaleinzug bei den French Open bescherten Seles kurzzeitig die Rückkehr auf den zweiten Platz der Weltrangliste. Sowohl in Hilton Head als auch in Paris unterlag sie jeweils nur äußerst knapp der neuen Nummer eins des Rankings, Martina Hingis. Doch bereits eine Woche später führte eine Schulterverletzung erneut zur Absage weiterer Einsätze. Bei den US Open unterlag Seles bereits im Viertelfinale Irina Spîrlea. Die Presse berichtete erstmals über die schwere Krebserkrankung ihres Vaters Karoly, der 1998 starb. Im Viertelfinale der Australian Open feierte Seles 1999 den ersten Sieg (7:5, 6:1) seit ihrem Comeback über Steffi Graf, verlor aber im Halbfinale gegen Martina Hingis. Das letzte Aufeinandertreffen der großen Rivalinnen Seles und Graf fand 1999 im Halbfinale der French Open statt. Graf gewann die Partie mit 6:7, 6:3 und 6:4. 1999–2007: Höhen und Tiefen, ständige Verletzungsprobleme Die nächsten Jahre waren von einigen Höhen und vielen Tiefen geprägt: Langen Verletzungspausen folgten immer wieder Turniersiege. Der letzte datiert vom Mai 2002, als Monica Seles die Madrid Open gewann. Es war der insgesamt 53. Turniererfolg der US-Amerikanerin. Seles’ letzter Auftritt auf der Profitour fand bei den French Open im Jahr 2003 statt. Die dreifache Paris-Siegerin unterlag in der ersten Runde der French Open völlig außer Form der Russin Nadja Petrowa mit 4:6 und 0:6. Ständige Rücken- und Fußprobleme zwangen Seles zum Rückzug von der Tour. Eine auf Anraten ihrer Ärzte eingelegte neunmonatige Pause brachte Seles zufolge nicht die erhoffte Verbesserung. Dem von Monica Seles in größeren Zeitabständen immer wieder geäußerten Wunsch, sie werde eventuell ein Comeback anstreben, folgten Monate des Schweigens. Spekulationen um ein stilles Ende ihrer Karriere ohne offizielle Rücktrittserklärung machten die Runde. 2008: Endgültiger Rücktritt Am 3. Dezember 2007 erklärte Monica Seles gegenüber der Zeitung Los Angeles Times ihre Absicht, möglicherweise im März 2008 beim Turnier in Miami auf die Tour zurückzukehren und ein Comeback zu versuchen. Seles betonte, dass sie sich nicht mehr im Stande sehe, eine komplette Saison zu spielen. Die mittlerweile 34-Jährige, deren letztes Spiel auf der Profitour mehr als vier Jahre zurücklag, erklärte, deshalb nur noch die Grand-Slam-Turniere sowie einige Veranstaltungen der zweithöchsten Kategorie in Angriff nehmen zu wollen. Am 15. Februar 2008 fanden alle Spekulationen um eine mögliche Rückkehr der ehemaligen Weltranglistenersten ein Ende. Fünf Jahre nachdem Seles ihr letztes offizielles Match bestritten hatte, ließ sie in Miami von ihrem Manager offiziell ihren Rücktritt vom Profitennissport erklären. Grund hierfür waren auch die weiterhin anhaltenden Schmerzen, die ihr immer wieder Probleme bereiteten. |
G;|Karl XII., auch latinisiert Carolus Rex, (* 17. Junijul./ 27. Juni 1682greg. in Stockholm; † 30. Novemberjul./ 11. Dezember 1718greg. bei Fredrikshald) war von 1697 bis 1718 König von Schweden und Herzog von Bremen und Verden. Seine Eltern waren der schwedische König Karl XI. und Ulrike Eleonore, Tochter des dänischen Königs Friedrich III. Der Großvater Karls XII., König Karl X. Gustav, entstammte dem Adelsgeschlecht der Wittelsbacher, Linie Pfalz-Zweibrücken. Fast während seiner gesamten Herrschaftszeit führte Karl XII. sein Land durch den Großen Nordischen Krieg, an dessen Ende Schweden seine Großmachtstellung in Europa verlor.  Kindheit und Jugend Karl XII. war der älteste Sohn Karls XI. von Schweden und seiner Gemahlin Ulrike von Dänemark. Vier seiner jüngeren Brüder starben im Kleinkindalter. Der Vater übte schon früh einen großen Einfluss auf seinen Sohn aus. Er hatte ihm das Reiten, Jagen und Fechten bereits im Kindesalter beigebracht. Als kleiner Kronprinz begann er vierjährig eine von seiner Mutter gesteuerte umfassende Ausbildung und erhielt sein eigenes Pferd, mit sieben übernahm er sein eigenes Regiment. Später bekam der zukünftige König von speziell ausgesuchten Lehrern Unterricht in Militärwissenschaft, Fremdsprachen, Jurisprudenz, Mathematik, Geographie, Literatur und Geschichte. Karl XII. wurde im Geist der Treue zu den Prinzipien der absoluten Monarchie erzogen. Er war elf Jahre alt, als er 1693 seine Mutter verlor. Schon bald zeigte sich sein ungestümer, weder auf sich noch andere rücksichtnehmender Charakter, der keinen Widerspruch duldete, mit hoher Verschwendung einherging und tollkühnen Reit- und Jagdunternehmen mit einer Reihe enger Freunde, in denen er mehrfach nur knapp dem Tod entkam. Er jagte häufig Bären mit Gabelstöcken, beteiligte sich an flegelhaften Streichen (wie den Bürgern die Fensterscheiben einzuschmeißen und verdiente Generäle zu hänseln) und eines der Vergnügen seines Kreises bestand darin, verschiedene Tiere bis hin zu Bullen mit dem Schwert zu enthaupten. Ermahnungen staatlicher Würdenträger oder von Predigern vermochten daran nichts zu ändern. Er zeigte allerdings ein ernsthaftes Interesse am Militär. Seine Thronfolge trat er nach dem Tod seines Vaters am 14. Dezember 1697 im Alter von fünfzehn Jahren an, indem er sich selbst zum König ausrief und eine Regentschaft ablehnte, wodurch der schwedische Reichstag (die vier schwedischen Reichsstände) ihn für volljährig erklärte. Anschließend setzte er die Krone des Monarchen selbst auf seinen Kopf, für damalige Zeiten ein absoluter Regelbruch. Dies drückte aber auch seinen absoluten Machtanspruch aus und wurde bereits 1701 von Friedrich I., König in Preußen bei seiner Königskrönung nachempfunden. Der Vater hatte seinem Sohn ein gefestigtes Staatswesen mit verstärkter Königsmacht und sanierten Staatsfinanzen hinterlassen. Bei seiner Thronbesteigung herrschte Karl XII. über das heutige Schweden, Finnland, Livland, Karelien und Ingermanland, Wismar und Schwedisch-Pommern und das Herzogtum Bremen-Verden. Die ersten Jahre seiner Regierung waren dem Anschein nach frei von außenpolitischen Problemen. Allerdings hatte der Ruf als leichtfertiger Draufgänger und Verschwender, den Karl XII. inzwischen genoss, bei anderen Mächten Begehrlichkeiten geweckt, da man das als Schwäche auslegte. Kriegsausbruch Im März 1700 begann der Große Nordische Krieg. Schweden wurde überraschend von Dänemark, Sachsen und Russland angegriffen. Bereits im Oktober 1698 hatten August II. von Sachsen und Friedrich IV. von Dänemark ein Offensivbündnis gegen Schweden geschlossen, dem Peter I. von Russland später beitrat. Einer der Hauptorganisatoren war der livländische Aristokrat Johann Reinhold von Patkul. Im Fall eines Sieges wollten die Verbündeten die zu Schweden gehörenden Ostsee-Provinzen (Schonen, Livland, Estland, Ingermanland und Schwedisch-Pommern) untereinander aufteilen. Die Allianz setzte auf einen leichten und schnellen Sieg, da das Land von einem sehr jungen und unerfahrenen König regiert und die gefürchtete schwedische Armee von einem Oberbefehlshaber wie es schien ohne jegliche militärische Erfahrung kommandiert wurde. So stand im Frühling 1700 Karl XII. einer starken Koalition gegenüber. Sein Verhalten wandelte sich sofort grundlegend. Er ging zu einer spartanischen Lebensweise über und konzentrierte sich ganz auf den Krieg. Seine Strategie dazu war einfach, führte aber letztlich nicht zum Erfolg. Er konzentrierte alle Kräfte auf jeweils einen Feind, um ihn zu besiegen und zum Frieden zu zwingen. Mit Dänemark und Sachsen-Polen gelang dies vorübergehend, nicht aber gegen Russland. Feldzug gegen Dänemark 1700 Die Feindseligkeiten begannen 1700 mit dem Angriff seines Cousins Friedrich IV. von Dänemark auf das mit Schweden verbündete Gottorfer Teilherzogtum in den Herzogtümern Schleswig und Holstein, das von Herzog Friedrich IV., einem Schwager Karls, regiert wurde. Karl nutzte die Abwesenheit der dänischen Armee, die in Holstein operierte, aus und landete am 23. Juli 1700 mit englisch-niederländischer Flottenunterstützung auf der dänischen Hauptinsel Seeland, schloss Kopenhagen ein und begann im August mit der Belagerung der dänischen Hauptstadt. Der dänische König sah sich nun in einer gefährlichen Lage. So schloss Friedrich IV. am 18. August 1700 mit Schweden den Frieden von Traventhal. Der Status quo ante wurde wieder hergestellt, Dänemark schied aus der anti-schwedischen Koalition aus. Feldzug gegen Russland 1700 Karl wandte sich nun den beiden verbliebenen Gegnern zu, dem Russischen Reich und Sachsen-Polen. Beide waren dabei, die schwedischen Besitzungen im Baltikum anzugreifen. Russland begann im August 1700 mit seinem Angriff auf Estland und im September wurde mit der Belagerung der schwedischen Festung Narwa begonnen. Karl XII. entschloss sich, das russische Heer anzugreifen und die Festung Narwa zu entsetzen. In der Schlacht bei Narva besiegte seine schwedischen Armee von etwa zehntausend Mann eine zahlenmäßig deutlich überlegene Armee der Russen. Die Schlacht bei Narwa gilt als einer der größten Siege der schwedischen Militärgeschichte. Ende 1700 hatte Karl XII. Schweden erfolgreich verteidigt und alle feindlichen Truppen von schwedischem Territorium vertrieben. Kämpfe in Polen und Sachsen 1700–1708 Anstatt das geschlagene russische Heer zu verfolgen, um es vollständig zu vernichten und Zar Peter zum Frieden zu zwingen, wandte sich der König nun seinem dritten Gegner zu, dem sächsischen Kurfürsten und König von Polen, den er als wortbrüchig ansah und von Grund auf hasste. Er eroberte Warschau, schlug August und seine sächsischen Truppen in der Schlacht bei Klissow 1702 und besetzte auch Krakau, die alte polnische Königsstadt. Nach der Absetzung Augusts als König von Polen 1704 platzierte Karl seinen eigenen Mann auf dem polnischen Thron, Stanislaus Leszczynski. Währenddessen konnte Peter gleichsam hinter Karls Rücken Ingermanland und Estland erobern und an der Ostsee sogar eine neue Stadt bauen – Sankt Petersburg. Nachdem Karl erkannt hatte, dass er August auf polnischem Territorium nicht besiegen konnte, da er in Sachsen immer wieder neue Armeen aufstellte, griff Karl 1706 Sachsen direkt an. Im Frieden von Altranstädt 1706 zwang er August schließlich zu einem Friedensvertrag und zum, wie Karl meinte, endgültigen Verzicht auf die polnische Königskrone. Damit endete vorerst die Personalunion Sachsen-Polen. Der König erreichte gleichzeitig mit seiner Drohung, auf Seiten Ludwigs XIV. von Frankreich in den Spanischen Erbfolgekrieg einzugreifen, dass den Lutheranern in der damals noch habsburgischen Provinz Schlesien in der Altranstädter Konvention 1707 eine begrenzte Religionsfreiheit zugestanden wurde. Er liess sich auch den Hauptorganisator der gegen ihn gerichteten Allianz Patkul von August dem Starken ausliefern und richtete ihn durch Räderung hin. Im Anschluss wandte er sich seinem letzten verbliebenen Gegner zu, Peter dem Großen. Feldzug in Russland 1708–1709 Um das Baltikum nicht ein weiteres Mal zum Schlachtfeld zu machen und um Russland endgültig zu besiegen, wollte er direkt Moskau, die russische Hauptstadt, angreifen. Die Niederlage in der Schlacht bei Lesnaja, wo unter anderem der wertvolle schwedische Versorgungszug von den Russen erobert wurde, zwang den König jedoch zum Ausweichen in die Ukraine. Karl erwartete dort Unterstützung durch eine massive Rebellion der ukrainischen Kosaken unter Iwan Masepa, aber die Russen besiegten die Aufständischen in ihrer Hochburg Baturyn, so dass Masepa Karl bei dessen Ankunft nur noch wenige Kämpfer zur Verfügung stellen konnte. Bei einem Aufklärungsversuch am 28. Juni 1709greg. wurde der König verwundet, weswegen er die schwedischen Kräfte nicht in der Schlacht bei Poltawa führen konnte. Die Schlacht wurde zu einem Desaster für die Schweden, und Karl floh ins Osmanische Reich, wo er ein Lager in Bender aufschlug. Aufenthalt im Osmanischen Reich 1709–1714 Die Türken begrüßten anfangs die Anwesenheit des schwedischen Königs, der auf einen Krieg zwischen Russen und Türken hinarbeitete und darin seine Hoffnung setzte. Allerdings war Sultan Ahmed III. nach dem Frieden vom Pruth Karls Intrigen überdrüssig. Janitscharen setzten ihn im Auftrag des Sultans beim Handgemenge von Bender am 12. Februar 1713 gefangen und wiesen ihm ein Quartier bei Adrianopel zu. Das Festsetzen des schwedischen Königs erleichterte den Frieden von Adrianopel zwischen Russen und Osmanen. Währenddessen nutzten Russland, Dänemark und Sachsen-Polen seine Abwesenheit und drängten Schweden weiter in die Defensive. England, ein Alliierter der Schweden, kam seinen Bündnispflichten nur durch die halbherzige Entsendung eines Ostseegeschwaders nach. Russland besetzte in der Zwischenzeit Finnland, und August der Starke erlangte die polnische Königskrone zurück. Verteidigung Pommerns 1714–1715 Nach Aufforderung durch den Sultan verließ Karl XII. erst im Oktober 1714 wieder das Osmanische Reich. Es gelang ihm in einem nur 15 Tage dauernden Gewaltritt, die 2150 Kilometer von Pitești in der Walachei durch Ungarn und Deutschland bis nach Stralsund in Schwedisch-Pommern zurückzulegen, wobei er nur von einem Offizier begleitet wurde. Unter Verkennung der Situation war es nun sein Ziel, die früheren Machtverhältnisse in Schwedisch-Pommern, das bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt fast vollständig von seinen Gegnern besetzt worden war, wiederherzustellen. Mit seiner unnachgiebigen Außenpolitik allerdings trieb er schließlich auch noch das bis dahin neutrale Königreich Preußen mit seinem König Friedrich Wilhelm I., der den Schwedenkönig wegen seiner „soldatischen Tugenden“ schätzte, in die gegnerischen Reihen. Dem vom 1. Mai 1715 geführten Pommernfeldzug der verbündeten Preußen, Dänen und Sachsen konnten die deutlich unterlegenen Schweden daher trotz aufopferungsvoller Führung durch den Schwedenkönig nicht widerstehen, und so floh Karl XII. am 22. Dezember 1715 zusammen mit drei Begleitern, um seiner Gefangennahme zu entgehen, kurz vor dem Fall der belagerten Festung Stralsund in einer kleinen Yacht über den teilweise zugefrorenen Strelasund in Richtung Hiddensee, von wo aus er mit der letzten dort befindlichen Fregatte sicher Trelleborg in Schweden erreichte. Rückkehr nach Schweden und Tod 1715–1718 Nach der Rückkehr setzte er wieder seine autokratische Herrschaft fort und sicherte sich mit dem holsteinischen Minister Georg Heinrich von Görtz einen diplomatisch geschickten Mitarbeiter, dem er weitgehend freie Hand ließ, insbesondere zur Beschaffung der für die Weiterführung des Kriegs notwendigen Mittel, wozu diesem alle Mittel recht waren bis hin zur Abwertung des Geldes (Görtz-Taler). Karls Bemühungen zur Wiederherstellung seines Reiches hatten ein Ende, als er 1716 versuchte Christiania (das heutige Oslo) im dänisch kontrollierten Norwegen zu erobern. Schweden lag durch die Kriege des ehrgeizigen Monarchen wirtschaftlich und finanziell am Boden, Karls Autorität war untergraben. Bei der erneuten Belagerung von Frederikshald während des zweiten Norwegenfeldzugs von 1718 wurde er durch eine Gewehrkugel getötet. Die Belagerung war zu diesem Zeitpunkt weit fortgeschritten und man erwartete den Fall der Festung innerhalb einer Woche, was den Weg nach Oslo (Christiania) freimachen würde. Die norwegischen Soldaten beschossen die mit Schanzarbeiten befassten schwedischen Soldaten die ganze Zeit über mit Artillerie. Am 11. Dezember hatte der Festungskommandant die Brustwehr mit Laternen und Pechfackeln bestücken lassen. Außerdem wurden in der mondhellen Nacht Leuchtkugeln von der Festung in Richtung der schwedischen Stellungen abgefeuert. Unter dieser Gefechtsfeldbeleuchtung wurde fortwährend mit Kanonen, Mörsern, Haubitzen und Gewehren auf die Belagerer geschossen. Rund 70 schwedische Soldaten waren in dem im Bau befindlichen Teil der Belagerungsgräben schon durch Beschuss gefallen. Trotz dieser Bedrohung inspizierte der König an diesem Abend diesen Teil der Laufgräben, rund 200 Meter von der Festung entfernt, und exponierte sich über dem Laufgraben, um einen Überblick zu erhalten. Gegen neun Uhr abends fand man den König allein an einer Böschung der Brustwehr mit dem Kopf auf der Krone der Brustwehr liegend am Boden. Eine Gewehrkugel war auf der einen Seite des Schädels eingedrungen und an der anderen ausgetreten, wobei die Frage der Richtung von ausschlaggebender Bedeutung ist: kam sie von links, müsste sie aufgrund der Orientierung des Belagerungsgrabens nach allgemeiner Meinung von der Festung gekommen sein, kam sie von rechts wahrscheinlich aus den eigenen Reihen. Neben Kugeln sind auch Blei-Kartätschen und Splitter aus Granatbeschuss als Todesursache diskutiert worden. Die Ergebnisse (basierend auf vier Autopsien, die letzte 1917) sind umstritten. Die Wunde an der rechten Schläfe ist kleiner als die linke und müsste demnach eigentlich die Eintrittswunde sein, die Autopsie von 1917 ging aber davon aus, dass die Kugel von links kam und die Wunden im Schädel nicht mehr im ursprünglichen Zustand waren. Auf dem Hut von Karl XII ist nur links ein Eintrittsloch und drei Zeugen, die unmittelbar bei Karl XII standen (der schwedische Leutnant Carlsberg, der französische Belagerungsingenieur Oberst Maigret und der Balte Friedrich von Kaulbars), sagten aus dass die Kugel von links kam und hörten ein Einschlaggeräusch wie von einem Stein in Matsch. Schon sehr früh gab es neben der offiziellen Version des Todes durch eine feindliche Kugel Vermutungen über ein Attentat aus eigenen Reihen, zum Beispiel in Notizen des Militärarztes Melchior Neumann, der die Leiche einbalsamierte. Der Tod des schwedischen König sprach sich trotz Bemühungen um Geheimhaltung und schneller Entfernung des Leichnams noch am Abend des 11. Dezembers innerhalb der Laufgräben herum und die Todesnachricht wurde vom französischen Generaladjutanten Sicre mit dem Hut von Karl XII. als Beweis dessen Nachfolger Friedrich überbracht. Auch dem Kommandanten der Festung wurde durch Überläufer vom Tod des Königs berichtet. Um den Tod gab es eine jahrhundertelange Kontroverse, die in der Zusammenfassung von Michael Roberts von 1991 offen blieb. Um Gewissheit zu erhalten, exhumierte man zuletzt 1917 die Leiche. Peter From kam nach Auswertung von gerichtsmedizinischen Untersuchungen, Kartenrekonstruktion zum Verlauf der Laufgräben und anderem zu der Schlussfolgerung, dass der König wahrscheinlich von einer norwegischen Musketenkugel getötet wurde. Andere Autoren wie Carl O. Nordling sehen Hinweise auf einen Mord aus eigenen Reihen. Otto Haintz hielt in seiner Biographie von Karl XII. einen Schuss von norwegischer Seite für am wahrscheinlichsten und sah keine überzeugenden Beweise für die Mordthese. Karl XII. verstarb unverheiratet und kinderlos. Seine Schwester Ulrika Eleonore, verheiratet mit Friedrich von Hessen-Kassel (Haupt der hessischen Partei am Hof) folgte ihm auf den Thron. Der Leichnam des Monarchen wurde nach Stockholm gebracht und in der Gruft der schwedischen Könige in Riddarholmskyrkan beigesetzt. |
G;|Otto Antoine (* 22. Oktober 1865 in Koblenz; † 14. Juli 1951 in Unteruhldingen) war ein deutscher Werbegrafiker und Vedutenmaler des Spätimpressionismus. Otto Antoine galt fast ein halbes Jahrhundert als ein bedeutender Repräsentant des kulturellen Berlin. In kaum zu zählenden Schilderungen dokumentierte er das Berlin des 19. Jahrhunderts bis in die erste Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts – für Künstlerfreunde war er „Der Maler von Berlin“. Seinen Ruhm erlangte Otto Antoine als „Postmaler“. Die Postbehörde, in deren Dienst er seit 1883 stand, hatte das künstlerische Talent des jungen Beamten früh erkannt und in großzügiger Weise gefördert.  Otto Antoine wurde am 22. Oktober 1865 in Koblenz als Sohn des Uhrmachers Georg A. Antoine und dessen Frau Marie Antoine Roesgen geboren. Schon in früher Jugend regte sich seine zeichnerische Begabung, doch wirtschaftliche Umstände und Herkunft erlaubten ihm nicht, die Malerei als Hauptberuf zu wählen. Nach dem Besuch der Oberrealschule schickte man ihn in die Lehre zu einem Malermeister. Mit 18 Jahren entschied er sich für die Beamtenlaufbahn und begann sie als Postgehilfe beim Postamt Lützel. Nach Feierabend zeichnete und malte er Motive seiner Heimatstadt Koblenz, allein auf das im Selbstunterricht erworbene Können und Wissen gestützt. Nach der Assistentenprüfung 1887 und dem einjährig-freiwilligen Militärdienst in einem Pionierbataillon wurde Antoine 1890 für kurze Zeit nach Hamburg versetzt. Antoine kam 1891 nach Berlin und studierte an der Akademie der Künste bei Franz Skarbina. Er wurde Mitglied des Vereins Berliner Künstler und nahm regelmäßig an den Großen Berliner Kunstausstellungen teil. 1942 wurde er in Berlin ausgebombt und ging für kurze Zeit nach Schlesien. Im Sommer 1944 übersiedelte er an den Bodensee, wo er sechs Jahre später verstarb. Sein Grab befindet sich in Berlin auf dem Friedhof Wilmersdorf. Der Postmaler Da Antoine eine schöne Handschrift hatte, übertrugen ihm seine Vorgesetzten als Sonderaufgaben immer wieder kalligraphische Arbeiten. Als das Reichspostamt und namentlich der Staatssekretär des Reichspostamts Heinrich von Stephan auf diese Arbeiten und auf Antoines erste Bilder mit Darstellungen aus dem postalischen Leben aufmerksam wurden, holte man ihn 1891 nach Berlin mit der Absicht, seine künstlerischen Fähigkeiten besser zu verwerten, als dies in der Provinz möglich war. Zuerst arbeitete er bei der Oberpostdirektion Berlin, dann vorübergehend im Technischen Baubüro des Reichspostamts. Hier aquarellierte er Fassaden und perspektivische Ansichten von Postbauten. Das brachte ihm die besondere Sympathie Stephans ein, der schon seit 1878 von den unter seiner Leitung errichteten größeren Post- und Telegrafengebäuden dokumentarische Aquarellzeichnungen anfertigen ließ. Am 1. April 1902 ernannte Stephan Otto Antoine zum Bureauassistenten beim Reichspostmuseum. Er sollte beim Aufbau des Museums mithelfen. Zu seinen Arbeiten gehörte, die vom Museum aus alten Handschriften und Büchern ausgewählten Abbildungen mit Darstellungen von schreibenden Personen, Schreibstuben, Botenfiguren, Postillionen, Postwagen, Schiffen und dergleichen für die Sammlungen künstlerisch aufzuarbeiten. Er kopierte, kolorierte wie vor ihm schon Karl Hoffacker (1856–1919) die von farbigen Darstellungen durch Lichtdruck in der Reichsdruckerei oder fotografisch angefertigten Nachbildungen, zeichnete in Blättern farbige Initialen neu oder undeutlich gewordene Beschriftungen in altdeutschen Lettern nach. Ein eindrucksvolles Beispiel für diese Arbeiten ist die von ihm frei nach einem Gemälde von Moritz von Schwind (1804–1871) für die Sammlung von Wagendarstellungen des Museums geschaffene Kopie in Öl auf Leinwand. „Ein Hochzeitspaar im Wagen“. Neben seinen künstlerischen Arbeiten für die Postbehörde betreute Otto Antoine mehr als 20 Jahre lang gemeinsam mit Ministerialamtmann Müller die Postwertzeichensammlung des Reichspostmuseums, die von 1885 bis 1899 und dann nochmals ab 1918 bis 1928 unter der Ägide des „Altmeisters der Philatelie“ Carl Lindenberg (1850–1928) stand. 1903 wurde Otto Antoine zum Oberpostsekretär befördert, 1915 erhielt er den Titel Rechnungsrat, 1920 wurde er zum Ministerialamtmann (Amtsrat) befördert. Im Zuge eines Stellenabbaus wurde er dann zum 1. April 1924 zunächst in den Wartestand und 1930 in den Ruhestand versetzt. Stephan förderte Antoine durch Ankauf postalischer Bilder für die Sammlungen des Postmuseums. Reinhold Kraetke ermöglichte ihm 1905 eine Studienreise nach den Kanarischen Inseln. Antoine genoss in Berlin einige Privilegien, durfte sein Dienstzimmer sogar als Maleratelier verwenden. Der Blick von diesem ging auf die Dreifaltigkeitskirche (auch Schleiermacherkirche) in der Mauerstraße, die er zu allen Jahres- und Tageszeiten malte. Zur Illustration einzelner Sachthemen gab das Reichspostmuseum zahlreiche Darstellungen bei Antoine in Auftrag, die im Museum öffentlich gezeigt wurden. Dazu gehörten auch die Gemälde „Ein Hochzeitspaar im Wagen“ 1897, und die „Augsburger Boten Peter Derffus und Gottfried Thanner“, 1898. Im September 1905 erwarb das Reichspostmuseum das während des erwähnten Studienaufenthalts entstandene Gemälde „Personenpost auf den Kanarischen Inseln“. Das Bild stellt einen zur Abfahrt bereiten Personenpostwagen auf Gran Canaria dar. Wie die Inschrift am Wagen besagt, geht die Post von Las Palmas nach Santa Brigida. Der Ort liegt in den Bergen. Deshalb ist eine besondere Bespannung mit vier Maultieren notwendig; drei Maultiere in einer Reihe, das vierte als Vorspann. Die unter den Fahrgästen befindliche Frau trägt nach spanischer Sitte ein weißes Tuch auf dem Kopf. Über dem Posthaus und der stimmungsvoll wiedergegebenen Straße wölbt sich ein tiefblauer Himmel. Immer wieder stellte Antoine in seinen Bildern eindrucksvoll den Post- und Telegrafenbetrieb in den Brennpunkten des hauptstädtischen Verkehrs dar. Bekannt ist sein Gemälde, das auf einem Bahnsteig des Anhalter Bahnhofs mehrere Postbeamte beim Verladen von Paketen aus gelben Wagen in einen grünen Bahnpostwagen zeigt. Sein Gemälde „Paketpost am Schlesischen Bahnhof“ fand auf der Großen Berliner Kunstausstellung 1912 viel Beifall. Mit dem 1909 entstandenen Bild vom Fernsprechamt in der Französischen Straße war Antoine 1911 auf der Großen Berliner Kunstausstellung vertreten. Es zeigt eine große gewölbeartige, mit Gaslampen beleuchtete Halle, in der in mehreren langen Reihen von Schränken Frauen Telefonverbindungen herstellen. Zweimal, um 1900 und 1908, malte Antoine den Betrieb im großen Saal des Haupttelegraphenamtes Berlin in der Jägerstraße. Die von ihm dargestellten Personen tragen hier die Züge der wirklich tätig gewesenen Beamten. Die Bilder sind insofern von aktuellem Interesse, als das denkmalgeschützte und von der Telekom restaurierte Gebäude des ehemaligen Kaiserlichen Telegrafenamtes mit dem von Antoine gemalten Saal heute einen Teil der Hauptstadtrepräsentanz der Telekom in Berlin bildet. Otto Antoine war ebenso ein talentierter Grafiker und Zeichner. Er schuf Neujahrskarten, Einladungskarten, Werbungen für den Rundfunk und anderes mehr. Die Zeichnungen, mit denen er seine berühmten Gemälde vorbereitete, lassen erkennen, wie genau er die Stadt, ihren Verkehr und ihre Veränderungen beobachtete. 1909 illustrierte Antoine die von Albert Falkenberg (Postbeamter) herausgegebene „Kleinstadtkomödie“, und 1919 erschienen von ihm 32 Federzeichnungen in dem Buch „Die Schönheit der deutschen Landschaft“ von Adolf Gruettner. Für das von Adolf Miethe 1912 bei Westermann in Braunschweig herausgegebene Werk „Die Technik im 20. Jahrhundert“ steuerte Antoine mehrere farbige Darstellungen aus technischen Großbetrieben bei. Der Maler Berlins Unmittelbar nach seinem Umzug 1891 von Koblenz nach Berlin nahm Antoine Kontakt zu den Berliner Künstlern auf. Er studierte nebenberuflich an der Hochschule für Bildende Künste und belegte Kurse im Landschafts- und Aktmalen. Dabei fand er in Professor Franz Skarbina (1849–1910) einen Künstler, der sein Talent erkannte und förderte, und der ihn lehrte, was er, der Autodidakt, noch zu lernen hatte. In seinen ersten Schaffensjahren malte Antoine hauptsächlich Landschaften und viel in Aquarell. Nach seiner Lehrzeit bei Skarbina bevorzugte er Ölfarbe als bei größeren Bildern ausdrucksfähigeres Material und wandte sich zunehmend Motiven der Stadt zu. Groß ist die Anzahl der Ölbilder, Pastelle, Aquarelle und Radierungen mit berlinischen Motiven. Pferdekutschen auf regennasser Straße, geschäftiges Treiben in der Leipziger Straße oder Passanten am Brandenburger Tor sind Eindrücke, die der Künstler in ihrer Zufälligkeit und Augenblicklichkeit festhielt. Dom, Schloss und Schloßbrücke (Kaiser-Friedrich-Brücke), Unter den Linden, Brandenburger Tor, Leipziger Platz mit Wertheim, Potsdamer Platz, Alexanderplatz mit Berolina und Polizeipräsidium, Reichstag, Tiergarten, Kurfürstendamm, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche und Tauentzienstraße, Rathaus und Altes Museum gehören wie selbstverständlich in die lange, hier längst nicht vollständige Liste der Berliner Bilder. Es ist das repräsentative Berlin, das Berlin der monumentalen Bauten. Alle Bilder sind stimmungsvoll in virtuos impressionistischer Technik gemalt. Das Zeitkolorit und seine Wandlungen sind an den Verkehrsmitteln, den Droschken, Elektrischen und Bussen mit ihrem noch offenen Obergeschoss und an der Kleidung der Fußgänger ablesbar. Mehrmals hielt Otto Antoine in seinen Gemälden auch militärische Szenerien, wie beispielsweise die Wachablösung Unter den Linden oder die Geburtstagsparade für den Kaiser, fest. Sonnabends und sonntags zog er gern in die Natur, begleitet von seiner Frau und seinen Kindern, um vor den Toren der Stadt unter freiem Himmel zu malen. Seit einem Aufenthalt in Neuwarp an der Ostsee 1916 war Otto Antoine mit dem Maler Hans Hartig freundschaftlich verbunden. Während Hartig, der bislang Landschaften und die Ostsee als Motiv bevorzugte, unter dem Einfluss seines Freundes Antoine die Großstadt für seine Malerei entdeckte, gelang es umgekehrt Hartig, Antoine für Motive der Ostsee zu interessieren. Mit dem Bildnis des im Hafen von Neuwarp malenden Hans Hartig setzte Antoine seinem Freund ein bleibendes Denkmal. Zu den Künstlern, mit denen Otto Antoine befreundet war, gehörten auch andere „Postmaler“, wie die im Berliner Kunstleben hervorgetreten Richard Albitz (1876–1954) und Gustav Fenkohl (1872–1950). Otto Antoine blieb zeitlebens dem Impressionismus verhaftet. Nach seiner Lehrzeit bei Skarbina veränderte er seine Malweise stilistisch kaum. Auch nicht, als um 1905 in Berlin eine Kunstrevolution einsetzte, die vom Impressionismus zum Expressionismus führte. Unter dem Druck staatlicher Kunstlenkung seit 1933 neigte er dann wie auch andere Maler zu realistischeren Darstellungen. 1893 wurde zum ersten Mal eine Arbeit von Antoine auf der Großen Berliner Kunstausstellung (Grobeka) im Landesausstellungsgebäude am Lehrter Bahnhof ausgestellte, 1894 folgte ein Ölgemälde („Es dunkelt…“). Ab 1897 war er dann fast regelmäßig auf dieser alljährlichen Ausstellung vertreten, die in der Zeit Kaiser Wilhelms II. (1859–1941, Kaiser von 1888 bis 1918) nur die Werke der offiziellen Malkunst präsentierte. Zuerst waren es Darstellungen aus seiner rheinländischen Heimat (z. B. 1900 „Abend an der Mosel“, 1901 „Lahneck“ und 1901 „An der Loreley“), dann, etwa ab 1911, hauptsächlich Berliner Motive. Ebenso hatten Antoines Bilder stets auch einen Platz im Künstlerhaus, der Ständigen Ausstellung von Werken lebender Künstler des Vereins Berliner Künstler. 1938 und 1941 bis 1943 war Antoine mit Darstellungen monumentaler Bauten, Plätze und Alleen der Reichshauptstadt, wie er sie z. B. in seinen Gemälden „Brandenburger Tor“, „Siegessäule“ oder „Vor dem Zeughaus in Berlin“ mit Zeughaus, Dom, Wache und Partien von Universität und Oper geschaffen hatte, auf der Großen Deutschen Kunstausstellung im Haus der Deutschen Kunst in München vertreten. Otto Antoine war Mitglied des 1841 gegründeten Vereins Berliner Künstler. Später vertrat er im Vorstand des Vereins seine Künstlerkollegen und wirkte wiederholt beim Aufbau der Großen Berliner Kunstausstellung mit. Dann war er Ehrenmitglied und Ehrenpräsident des Vereins. Als nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg in der offiziell geförderten Kunst Berlins ein demokratischer Pluralismus einzog und die Künstlervereinigungen Verein Berliner Künstler, Berliner Secession, Freie Secession und Novembergruppe erstmals unter einem Dach einen Gesamtüberblick über das Kunstschaffen Berlins gaben, vertraten in der dazu gebildeten gemeinsamen Jury Otto Antoine und Hans Hartig die Interessen des Vereins Berliner Künstler. Als im Herbst 1933 durch Gesetz die Reichskulturkammer geschaffen wurde, wurde Antoine Mitglied, um seinen Beruf weiter ausüben zu können. So wie Otto Antoines Ruhm wuchs, nahmen Anerkennung und Aufträge zu. Museen, öffentliche und staatliche Einrichtungen, private Liebhaber und Sammler kauften seine Arbeiten. Popularität erlangte er zusätzlich durch Wiedergabe seiner Bilder in Kalendern und durch hohe Postkartenauflagen vieler seiner Bilder, postalische Motive eingeschlossen. Mehrere Arbeiten von Otto Antoine gingen in den Wirren des Zweiten Weltkriegs verloren. Dazu gehören beispielsweise 24 Ölbilder mit Darstellungen von Straßen, Brücken und Plätzen Berlins, die die Stadt Berlin als wichtige Zeitdokumente in Kriegsverwahrung nahm und in den Warthegau verbrachte. Ebenfalls als verschollen gilt das Bild „Leipziger Straße“ aus dem Bestand der Berliner Nationalgalerie, das sich im Oberschlesischen Museum Gleiwitz befand. Glücklicherweise blieb ein großer Teil seines Schaffens erhalten. Einen kompletten Überblick zu den Standorten der Arbeiten Antoines gibt es gegenwärtig aber nicht. Die folgenden Informationen können dafür allenfalls Anhaltspunkte sein. Eine größere Anzahl von Werken befindet sich im Besitz der Familie und anderer privater Sammler. Die von Antoine für das Reichspostmuseum gemalten Bilder und einige nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg von den deutschen Postmuseen erworbene Arbeiten werden heute in der Museumsstiftung Post und Telekommunikation bewahrt. Dazu gehören vor allem 22 Ölbilder und 16 Aquarelle sowie Zeichnungen und kolorierte Faksimile. Die Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlin bewahrt aus ehemals städtischem Besitz vier Gemälde („Sicherheitspolizei in Berlin, 1920“, „Kaiser-Friedrich-Brücke, 1921“, „Leipziger Platz, 1925“, „Am Potsdamer Platz, 1930“) und zwei Grafiken von Antoine. Das Deutsche Technikmuseum Berlin besitzt das Gemälde „Überführung der Hochbahn zu Berlin über die elektrische Vorortbahn und Fernbahn“ (vermutlich 1905) mit den gelben Straßenpostwagen am Gleisdreieck. Antoines Ölgemälde aus der Zeit um 1920 vom Berliner Straßenverkehr am 1882 erbauten Alexanderplatz befindet sich im Bezirksamt Reinickendorf in Berlin. Die Rhein-Chemie Holding in Heidelberg besitzt eine Sammlung von Aquarellen mit Berliner Ansichten (29 waren in der erwähnten Ausstellung Alt-Berlin im Bild aus Anlass des 100. Geburtstages des Künstlers zu sehen). Über siebzigjährig reiste Otto Antoine zum ersten Mal nach Amerika, um seine dort lebende Tochter zu besuchen. Von der Reise brachte er Skizzen und Bilder, wie beispielsweise „Chicago, Michigan Avenue, Zentrum“, mit. 1942 verlor Antoine durch Bomben Wohnung und Atelier in der Weimarischen Straße 2 in Berlin Wilmersdorf, wo er seit über vier Jahrzehnten mit seiner Familie gelebt hatte. Für kurze Zeit gingen er und seine Frau nach Schlesien, bevor sie im Sommer 1944 in Unteruhldingen am Bodensee neu Fuß fassten. In dieser Zeit waren die für die Arbeit des Malers notwendigen Materialien knapp und bezugsscheinpflichtig. Da der für Antoine zuständige Landesleiter der Reichskammer der bildenden Künste beim Landeskulturwalter Gau Baden in Karlsruhe im Sommer 1944 nicht mehr arbeitsfähig war, wandte er sich am 31. Dezember 1944 an den Landeskulturwalter Gau Berlin und hatte Glück. Am 10. Januar 1945 erhielt er noch einen letzten Reichsbezugsausweis für einige Utensilien. In Unteruhldingen war Otto Antoine bis zu seinem Tod aktiv. In einigen Bildern hielt er seine neue Heimat am Bodensee fest. Sein Berlin aber fehlte ihm. Bis zuletzt arbeitete er an einem Zyklus von Aquarellen für eine Kunstmappe über das Berlin von einst, die nicht mehr publiziert wurde. |
G;|Mary Lou Williams (geboren als Mary Alfrieda Scruggs; * 8. Mai 1910 in Atlanta, Georgia; † 28. Mai 1981 in Durham, North Carolina) war eine US-amerikanische Jazzmusikerin (Pianistin, Komponistin und Arrangeurin). Sie gilt als eine der wichtigsten Wegbereiterinnen der geschlechtlichen Gleichberechtigung im Jazz und war „die einzige Stride-Pianistin, die vergleichbar mit Ellington ihren Stil ständig modernisierte und sich zuletzt auch an moderner Harmonik orientierte“.     Kindheit und frühe Jugend Mary Lou Williams wuchs in East Liberty – einem Vorort von Pittsburgh – als eines von elf Kindern auf. Ihre (zunächst alleinerziehende) Mutter arbeitete als Putzfrau, sang in ihrer Freizeit Spirituals und spielte Ragtime auf dem Piano und der Orgel. Mary Lou Williams brachte sich im Alter von drei bis vier Jahren autodidaktisch das Klavierspielen bei, indem sie das gerade von ihrer Mutter Gehörte nachspielte. Später schulte sie sich mit Hilfe der Rollen eines ihrem Onkel gehörenden elektrischen Klaviers, auf dem sie die Interpretationen von Jelly Roll Morton und James P. Johnson hörte und nachspielte. Als Elfjährige besuchte sie Konzerte und lernte so Arrangements von Don Redman und den Pianisten Earl Hines kennen. Ohne Wissen ihrer Familie trat sie mit sechs Jahren in der Nachbarschaft als Pianistin auf, begleitete bald auch Stummfilme und spielte wenig später als „Wunderkind“ auf Partys bei der Oberschicht, etwa bei den Mellons. Sie spielte nicht nur Ragtime, sondern auch klassische Werke, populäre Melodien und Kirchenlieder. Ab 1924 besuchte sie die Westinghouse High School, die sie im Alter von fünfzehn Jahren verließ, weil ihr Männer aus der Nachbarschaft nachstellten und sie sexuelle Übergriffe befürchtete. Ihr erstes Engagement hatte sie bei einer Vaudeville-Gruppe der TOBA, wo sie die in diesem Genre üblichen Showeinlagen zeigte, indem sie etwa ein Stück auf dem Piano mit den Fäusten spielte oder während des Spiels einmal ums Klavier herum rannte. Mit sechzehn Jahren heiratete sie den Saxophonisten John „Bearcat“ Williams, den sie in dieser Show kennengelernt hatte und mit dessen Vaudeville-Orchester Syncopaters sie seit Ende 1925 auf Tour ging. Die Band wurde in Kansas City von dem damals erfolgreichen Vaudeville-Duo Seymour and Jeanette engagiert. Allerdings stellte sich die Frage, ob Williams als Frau überhaupt mitspielen dürfe; ihr Ehemann befürwortete es, da es eine große Attraktion sei, wenn eine Frau gut Piano spiele. Seine Ansicht stellte sich als richtig heraus. Während dieses Engagements, das über Chicago nach New York City führte, begegnete sie auch Fats Waller. Sie verblüffte den Pianisten, weil sie auch seine schwierigsten Kompositionen nach einmaligem Hören interpretieren konnte. Nach Seymours Tod begleitete sie dessen Partnerin Jeanette James und spielte mit ihr 1927 mehrere Plattenseiten ein; bei Auftritten in New York gehörten auch Musiker von Ellingtons „Washingtonians“ wie Tricky Sam Nanton zur Begleitband, was ihr eine neue musikalische Welt öffnete. Kansas City 1929 bis 1942 1929 spielte sie aushilfsweise in der von Andy Kirk geleiteten Bigband The Twelve Clouds of Joy. Diese Band war aus Terrence Holders Dark Clouds of Joy entstanden, in der seit 1928 ihr Ehemann engagiert war. Damit er dort spielen konnte, hatte Williams die Leitung seiner eigenen, in Memphis operierenden Band seiner Ehefrau überlassen. Für die ersten Plattenaufnahmen von Kirks Band 1929 fungierte sie nicht nur als Pianistin für den bei der Probe im Aufnahmestudio abwesenden Marion Jackson, sondern trug auch erste Kompositionen und Arrangements bei, obwohl sie zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch über wenig Kenntnisse von Notation und Harmonielehre verfügte. Offizieller Pianist der Band blieb weiterhin Marion Jackson. 1930 machte sie erste Soloaufnahmen unter eigenem Namen für Brunswick Records („Drag 'em“ und „Night Life“); die Plattenfirma bestand weiterhin darauf, dass sie als Pianistin an den Aufnahmen der Twelve Clouds of Joy mitwirkte. Erst 1931, anlässlich eines Gastspiels mit Blanche Calloway, wurde sie die reguläre Pianistin der Twelve Clouds of Joy, nachdem geklärt war, dass sie nicht im einheitlichen Anzug, sondern im Kleid auftrat. Das Orchester arbeitete bis 1936 als Territory Band rund um Kansas City. Ihre Kompositionen „Walkin’ and Swingin’“, „In the Groove“ und „Mary’s Idea“ entwickelten sich zu Hits und machten die Band bekannt. In diesen Jahren war sie auch bei den zahllosen Jamsessions mit den Musikern des Kansas City Jazz dabei, wie mit Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster (mit dem sie eine Liebesbeziehung hatte), Lester Young und Herschel Evans. Da Williams ungewöhnliche Harmonien in ihre Improvisationen einbaute, wurde sie wegen dieser „Zombie-Musik“ von den anderen Musikern sehr geschätzt. Ab 1936 veränderte sich der Tourneeplan und auch das Repertoire der Band: Unter dem Management von Joe Glaser spielten die Twelve Clouds of Joy überall in den Vereinigten Staaten und auch in Kanada; Balladen und Tanzmusik traten in den Vordergrund des Repertoires. Mary Lou Williams wurde besser bezahlt, allerdings als „Nischenmusikerin“ für einige jazzige Nummern, die weiterhin im Programm blieben. Auf Vermittlung von John Hammond arrangierte und schrieb sie ab 1936 auch für die Band von Benny Goodman neue Kompositionen wie „Roll ’Em“ oder „Camel Hop“, aber auch Arrangements ihres „Froggy Bottom“ (als „Overhand“), ihres „Messa Stomp“ oder von „Sweet Georgia Brown“. Goodmans Angebot, nur noch für ihn zu arrangieren und in seinem Orchester als Pianistin tätig zu sein, lehnte sie jedoch ab. Auch nahm sie 1938 mit Mildred Bailey auf; eine geplante Aufnahme, bei der sie Billie Holiday begleiten sollte, kam wegen einer Erkrankung nicht zustande. Pittsburgh/New York City – 1942 bis 1949 Noch bis 1942 blieb Williams bei den Twelve Clouds of Joy. Dann kehrte sie zunächst nach Pittsburgh zurück, wo sie ihre eigene Band zusammenstellte, der ihr späterer zweiter Ehemann „Shorty“ Baker und der junge Art Blakey angehörte. Baker wechselte jedoch wieder in das Duke Ellington Orchestra, für das Williams nach der Heirat mit Baker im Dezember 1942 neben Billy Strayhorn als feste Band-Arrangeurin fungierte. Ihr bekanntester Titel für Ellington war „Trumpets No End“, der auf Irving Berlins „Blue Skies“ basierte und mehrfach aufgenommen wurde. Nach sechs Monaten verließ sie Ellington und spielte mehrere längere Engagements im Café Society in Greenwich Village, wo sie auch Josh White begleitete; 1944 nahm sie „Mary Lou’s Boogie“/„Roll Èm“ für Moses Asch auf. Im Jahre 1945 – Baker hatte sich während seines Wehrdiensts von ihr getrennt – hatte sie auf Vermittlung von Barney Josephson, dem Besitzer von Café Society, eine eigene Radiosendung (The Mary Lou Williams Piano Workshop) bei WNEW, einem der damals führenden Sender mit gutem Popmusik-Programm Ab 1946 trat sie in mehreren Frauenbands auf, unter anderem mit Mary Osborne (mit der sie eine 78er für Continental einspielte, „She’s (He’s) Funny That Way“) und bei den Girls Stars mit June Rothenberg und Bridget O'Flynn; sie spielten ein Programm aus Standards sowie Dvořáks „Humoresque“ und „All God’s Chillun Got Rhythm“. Ihre Wohnung in Harlem wurde zu einem Treffpunkt der Pioniere des Modern Jazz, wie Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie und Tadd Dameron, mit denen sie Ideen und Kompositionen austauschte und zu deren Mentorin sie wurde. Sie wurde deshalb auch die „Mutter des Bebop“ genannt. Anders als viele ihrer Altersgenossen schätzte Mary Lou Williams, was die Bopper machten; den Bebop integrierte sie ab 1946 auch in ihr eigenes Spiel. Die harmonischen Erweiterungen dieses neuen Jazzstils übernahm sie auch in ihre Kompositionen, etwa „In the Land of Oo-Bla-Dee“ (Liedtext: Milt Orent), das Dizzy Gillespie in ihrem Arrangement mit seiner Big Band aufnahm. Einige ihrer Stücke spielte Benny Goodman mit seinem kurzlebigen Bop-orientierten Ensemble ein, dem sie 1948 als Arrangeurin und teilweise auch als Pianistin angehörte. Im August 1949 eröffnete sie die Tradition der Jazzkonzerte im New Yorker Club Village Vanguard. Suche nach einem neuen Weg Anfang der 1950er Jahre sah sie sich aufgrund finanzieller Engpässe gezwungen, als Begleiterin von Mildred Bailey zu touren. 1952 trat sie mit Kenny Clarke und Oscar Pettiford im Downbeat Club auf. Im gleichen Jahr ging sie auf eine kurze Tournee nach England, aus der eine längere Zeit in Europa wurde. Sie trat mehrfach in der Royal Albert Hall und der Royal Festival Hall auf; 1953 ging sie auf Gastspielreisen in die Niederlande und nach Skandinavien, begleitete Sarah Vaughan und ließ sich in Paris nieder, wo sie u. a. für Disques Vogue mit Don Byas aufnahm (Don Carlos Meets Mary Lou und das Soloalbum In Paris). Auch in der Schweiz und in Deutschland trat sie auf – im November 1954 in Baden-Baden mit dem Orchester Kurt Edelhagen. 1954 kam es in Paris zu verschiedenen Begegnungen im Plattenstudio mit amerikanischen, aber auch mit europäischen Musikern. Eher seltsam muten zwei Titel mit der britischen Sängerin Beryl Bryden an; mehr Bestand hatten die Solo- („I Made You Love Paris“) und Trio-Einspielungen, u. a. mit Jean-Louis Viale und im Jahr zuvor mit Don Byas. Nachdem sie bei einer Party in London nach der Mitteilung, ihr gehe es derzeit nicht sehr gut, von einem Gast den Psalm 91 zu lesen bekam, erhielt sie in Frankreich von Gérard Pochonet die Einladung, ein halbes Jahr auf dem Landsitz dessen Großvaters zu verbringen und sich dort auszuruhen: „Ich blieb sechs Monate, und ich schlief und aß, las die Psalmen und betete.“ Schon in Paris und verstärkt nach ihrer Rückkehr in die Staaten 1954, wo sie zunächst nur wenige Auftrittsmöglichkeiten wahrnahm, wandte sich Williams der Religion zu. Sie predigte 1955 für die Abyssinian Baptists auf den Straßen Harlems und sorgte sich um arme Verwandte und um bedürftige Musiker (wie Bud Powell). 1957 konvertierte sie unter dem Einfluss eines Jazz-begeisterten Priesters (John Crowley), den Dizzy Gillespie ihr vorstellte, zusammen mit Gillespies Ehefrau Lorraine, einer engen Freundin, zum katholischen Glauben. Der Priester Anthony Wood wurde ihr spiritueller Mentor und überzeugte sie, weiter musikalisch aktiv zu bleiben: 1957 feierte sie auf dem Newport Jazz Festival mit der Dizzy Gillespie Big Band ein Comeback, bei dem sie Teile der von Melba Liston neu arrangierten Zodiac Suite aufführte. Anschließend trat sie wieder vermehrt öffentlich auf. Daneben war sie gemeinnützig tätig und gründete 1958 die Stiftung Bel Canto, die Musikern bei der Lösung ihrer Drogenprobleme helfen sollte, der Crux vieler Musiker der Bebopszene der 1940er Jahre. Zehn Prozent ihrer musikalischen Erlöse ließ sie dem Projekt zukommen, für das sie auch einen Second Hand Laden in Harlem betrieb. Aufgrund finanziellen Misserfolgs musste sie ihre Bel Canto Foundation allerdings 1968 aufgeben. Nach ihrer Konversion zum Katholizismus komponierte sie zunehmend liturgische Stücke wie die Suite Black Christ of the Andes (gewidmet dem gerade heiliggesprochenen Martin de Porres), die sie auf einen Text von Anthony Wood 1962 mit den Ray Charles Singers und Milton Hinton auch im Lincoln Center aufführte. 1964 trat sie für ein ganzes Jahr im New Yorker Jazzclub Hickory House auf; im gleichen Jahr gründete sie mit Hilfe der katholischen Kirche in Pittsburgh ein Jazzfestival. Ebenfalls um diese Zeit wurde der junge Jesuitenpater Peter O’Brien ihr spiritueller Berater; 1971 wurde er auch ihr Manager (eine Funktion, die er bis zu ihrem Tod ausübte). Neben ihren Club-Auftritten spielte Williams in Colleges, gründete ein eigenes Plattenlabel (Mary Records) und einen Musikverlag und trat in Fernsehsendungen auf. 1967 trat sie mit einem Konzert in der Carnegie Hall dafür ein, neue musikalische Ansätze in die katholische Kirchenmusik zu integrieren. Im gleichen Jahr schrieb sie eine der ersten vollständig mit Jazzmusik unterlegten katholischen Messen überhaupt. 1968 komponierte sie ihre zweite Messe, Mass for the Lenten Season. Aus ihrer Präsentation der zweiten Messe im Vatikan 1969 resultierte zwar trotz einer Audienz beim Papst nicht die erhoffte päpstliche Förderung der Jazzmessen, aber immerhin kam es zu einem Auftrag für die dritte, Music for Peace (später meist Mary Lou’s Mass genannt), durch den Sekretär der Kurienkommission Justitia et Pax, Joseph Gremillion. In diesem Werk näherte sie sich teilweise dem Rockjazz-Idiom an. Zurück auf der Szene: 1970 bis 1979 Seit 1970 spielte Williams regelmäßig in der New Yorker Cookery; hinzu kamen Club-Gastspiele (etwa in London), Schul-Workshops und Festivals. Auf dem Monterey Jazz Festival wurde sie 1971 mit Jay McShann als „Wiederentdeckung des Jahres“ mit Standing Ovations geehrt. Auch trat sie in Radio und Fernsehen auf (u. a. in der Sesamstraße 1973 und in Billy Taylors Jazzmobile Workshop); daneben führte sie weiterhin ihre Messe auf. Anders als in den letzten Jahren wurden ihre neuen Aufnahmen nun wieder regelmäßig auf etablierten Jazz-Labels veröffentlicht. Das Live-Album Giants (1971), auf dem sie mit Dizzy Gillespie, Bobby Hackett, George Duvivier und Grady Tate zu hören war, wurde für einen Grammy nominiert und von Kritiker Dan Morgenstern als „eines der wirklich größten Alben der Jazzgeschichte“ gewürdigt. Musikalisch blieb sie trotz ihrer Kritik an einem Free Jazz, der den Kontakt zur Jazztradition verloren habe, weiter offen und spielte 1977 ein Konzert mit Cecil Taylor in der Carnegie Hall, das als Embraced angekündigt wurde, sich als „stürmischer Kontakt mit der neuen Avantgarde“ erwies und bei Pablo Records als Album veröffentlicht wurde. Reclams Jazzlexikon zufolge endete das Konzert „musikalisch in einem Fiasko“. Zudem trat sie 1978 im Weißen Haus vor Präsident Carter auf. Im selben Jahr gastierte sie auf mehreren Festivals in Europa, so auf dem North Sea Jazz Festival und mit einem Solo Recital (so die gleichnamige LP) auf dem Montreux Jazz Festival, außerdem als erster Gast in Marian McPartlands Radiosendung Piano Jazz. Von 1977 bis zu ihrem Krebstod 1981 war sie Artist in Residence (ab 1980 auch mit Lehrauftrag) an der Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, wo nach ihrem Tod das heutige Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture entstand. Sie erhielt sechs Ehrendoktorhüte und war zweimal Guggenheim-Stipendiatin. Persönlichkeit Aufgrund ihres schüchternen Wesens war die introvertierte Pianistin auf einen proaktiven Manager angewiesen; zunächst übernahm ihr erster Ehemann diese Funktion, später Pater O’Brien. Nach dem Urteil ihres spirituellen Mentors Anthony Woods war sie intuitiv denkend, ursprünglich und sehr direkt. Sie bedurfte nach seiner Ansicht eines vertrauenswürdigen Gegenübers zum Aussortieren von Ideen. Dennoch bewies sie mehrfach sehr eigenständige Urteile und lehnte beispielsweise in Situationen, in denen es ihr wirtschaftlich nicht gut ging, Tourneen mit Musikern wie Louis Armstrong ab, da sie dort zu viele Kompromisse hätte machen müssen. |
G;|Hellmuth Carl Elbrechter (* 19. Januar 1895 in Elberfeld; † 10. August 1971 in Düsseldorf) (Pseudonym: Hermann Vensky) war ein deutscher Journalist. Elbrechter wurde vor allem bekannt als Mitglied des sogenannten TAT-Kreises um Hans Zehrer und als Mitarbeiter des Generals Kurt von Schleicher in der Spätphase der Weimarer Republik.  Jugend und Studium (1895 bis 1921) Hellmuth Elbrechter war Sohn des Rektors Karl Elbrechter. Von Ostern 1906 bis Ostern 1914 besuchte er das humanistische Gymnasium in Elberfeld. Anschließend trat er in das 19. bayerische Infanterieregiment in Erlangen ein. Gleichzeitig nahm er das Studium der Germanistik und Kulturgeschichte auf. Von August 1914 bis Dezember 1918 nahm er im Jäger-Regiment zu Pferde Nr. 7, als Jagdflieger und später – nachdem er die Folgen von zwei Abstürzen auskuriert hatte – als Führer einer Genesungskompanie in Trier eingesetzt wurde. Nach der Novemberrevolution von 1918 gehörte er zeitweise dem Soldatenrat der Trierer Garnison an. Nach dem Krieg begann Elbrechter im Februar 1919 in Münster in Westfalen mit dem Studium der Zahnmedizin. Im Sommersemester 1919 wechselte er an die Albert Ludwig Universität in Freiburg im Breisgau, wo er im Januar 1920 das Physikum ablegte. Es folgte ein klinisches Semester in Leipzig und weitere in Freiburg. 1921 promovierte Elbrechter an der medizinischen Fakultät der Freiburger Universität zum Dr. med. dent. Seine Promotionsschrift, zu der ihm Wilhelm Herrenknecht das Thema vermittelt hatte, behandelte das Thema Üble Zufälle in der Zahnextraktion. Bereits im März 1921 hatte er bereits das Staatsexamen bestanden und am 13. April 1921 wurde ihm die Approbation zum Zahnarzt ausgestellt. Tätigkeit im NS-Umfeld (1921 bis 1928) Nach seinem Studium ließ Elbrechter sich als praktizierender Zahnarzt in Elberfeld nieder. Dort kam er im Laufe der Zeit mit der nationalsozialistischen Bewegung in Kontakt, deren „linker“, norddeutscher Flügel um Gregor Strasser zeitweise sein Zentrum in Elberfeld hatte. 1923 erfolgte die erste Begegnung mit Strasser, zu dessen Mitarbeitern Elbrechter in den Jahren 1925/26 zählte, ohne selbst Mitglied der NSDAP zu werden. Enge freundschaftliche Bande schloss Elbrechter zu dieser Zeit insbesondere mit dem Gauleiter Karl Kaufmann. Mit Kaufmanns Gaugeschäftsführer, dem jungen Joseph Goebbels, verband Elbrechter dagegen eine ausgeprägte gegenseitige Abneigung. Goebbels beschrieb Elbrechter – nach einer kurzen Phase der Sympathie („Elbrechter ist ein lieber Kerl. Ich werde gut mit ihm fertig.“) – in seinen Tagebüchern als seinen „bösen Feind“ und goss häufiger lange Schimpftiraden über ihn aus. So charakterisierte er den Arzt als den „bösen Geist“ seines Freundes Kaufmann, der eigentlich ein „armer“ und „unglückseliger Mensch“ sei, „der das Gute“ wolle. Ferner verlieh Goebbels seiner Furcht Ausdruck, seinen Freund Kaufmann „über kurz oder lang“ durch Elbrechters unheilvolles Wirken („Schuld daran wird Elbrechter tragen.“) zu verlieren, was „schon immer“ seine, Goebbels', „schlechte Ahnung“ gewesen sei. An anderen Stellen beschimpft der spätere Propagandaminister Elbrechter als „Fuchsdackel“, „Freimaurer“ und als „Schuft“, der „unschädlich“ gemacht werden müsse. Kaufmann führte Goebbels’ Haltung zu Elbrechter später darauf zurück, dass „dieser ein Intrigant sein konnte und sich wie eine eifersüchtige Primadonna benahm, wenn man nicht ihn, sondern [einen anderen wie] zum Beispiel den Dr. Elbrechter um seine Meinung zu irgendwelchen Problemen fragte.“ Elbrechter selbst gab im Rückblick an, dass er Goebbels „nie besonders gut leiden“ habe mögen und ihn für „geschwätzig und zu hochtrabend gehalten“ habe. Im September 1925 leitete Elbrechter eine Tagung der Strasser-Gruppe der NSDAP in Hagen, auf der er und Goebbels von Strasser „als junge ehrgeizige Parteimänner“ vorgestellt wurden. Zur selben Zeit beteiligte er sich am Bamberger Programm der NSDAP. Während seiner Elberfelder Jahre heiratete Elbrechter auch eine Frau Speth, die Tochter eines Uhrmachermeisters und Juweliers aus Elberfeld, deren Schwester später Karl Kaufmann heiratete (den Umstand, dass Kaufmanns Ehefrau die Schwägerin von Elbrechter war („Kaufmann heiratet die Schwägerin von Dr. Elbrechter.“), vermerkt Goebbels in seinem Tagebuch). Im Tatkreis und als Berater Schleichers (1928 bis 1933) Ab 1928 ist Elbrechter im Berliner Adressbuch als Zahnarzt mit einer Praxis in der Brückenallee Nr. 14 verzeichnet. 1929 begann Elbrechter, der sich in seiner Freizeit als Journalist betätigte, auf Bitten von Hans Zehrer an der politischen Monatsschrift Die Tat mitzuarbeiten, deren Redaktionsleitung Zehrer zu dieser Zeit übernahm. Die Tat, für die Elbechter vor allem außenpolitische Beiträge beisteuerte, wurde in den folgenden Jahren zu einem der einflussreichsten publizistischen Organe des Landes. Insbesondere galt die Zeitschrift als Ideenlieferant des politisch mächtigen Reichswehrgenerals Kurt von Schleicher. Seine Mitarbeit an der Tat beschränkte sich dabei auf vier größere Aufsätze, deren ergiebigster eine Interpretation des Konservatismus auf Grundlage von Arthur Moeller van den Brucks Das Dritte Reich und Quabbes Tar a Ri war. Ferner schrieb Elbrechter auch für die Tägliche Rundschau. In den Jahren 1932 und 1933 fungierte Elbrechter, der nun auch persönlich in engem Kontakt zu Schleicher stand, als Vermittler zwischen der Tat-Redaktion und dem Reichswehrministerium. Demant sieht hierin die „eigentliche Bedeutung“ von Elbrechters Person für die deutsche Politik der frühen 1930er Jahre. Mit Schleicher war Elbrechter bekannt geworden, als sich der General auf der Suche nach einem Verbindungsmann zu dem NSDAP-Politiker Gregor Strasser an den Zahnarzt wandte, zu dessen Patienten Strasser gehörte. Auf die Idee, sich an Strasser zu wenden, verfiel Schleicher aufgrund einer Empfehlung von Bodo von Alvensleben. Schleicher zeigte sich sofort beeindruckt durch Elbrechter, den er als intelligent und verschwiegen schätzte und von dem er meinte, er sei „Endlich mal ein Mensch, mit dem man reden kann!“, und machte ihn fortan zu einem seiner engsten persönlichen Berater. Elbrechter agierte seither als Mittelsmann oder, mit den Worten Rohrers, als „eine Art graue Eminenz“ zwischen den beiden Politikern und stellte unter anderem auch seine Privatwohnung in der Schaperstraße 29 für geheime Treffen und Verhandlungen der beiden zur Verfügung. Einige Autoren billigen ihm daher für das Jahr 1932 den Rang einer „Schaltstelle für eine mögliche Anti-Hitler-Koalition“ zu. Andere Politiker, zu denen Elbrechter persönliche Kontakte unterhielt, waren der Reichskanzler Heinrich Brüning und der Rechtskonservative Gottfried Treviranus, die beide zu seinen Patienten zählten und lose mit ihm befreundet waren. Der Historiker Axel Schildt identifiziert Elbrechter für diese Zeit auch jenseits seiner Mitarbeit an der Tat als wichtigen Ideengeber Schleichers und Strassers. So vertreten Schildt, in seiner Arbeit zum Kabinett Schleicher, und Ursula Hüllbüsch in ihrer Arbeit zum Verhältnis von Gewerkschaften und Staat die Meinung, Elbrechter sei der eigentliche Verfasser der aufsehenerregenden Rede gewesen, die Gregor Strasser am 10. Mai im Reichstag hielt. In dieser trug Strasser die Umrisse eines Arbeitsbeschaffungsprogramms vor, das wahrscheinlich auch von Elbrechter miterarbeitet worden war. In der historischen Forschung wird Strassers Programm, als das einzige konstruktive Programm zur Arbeitsbeschaffung, das zu dieser Zeit der Öffentlichkeit von einer Partei unterbreitet wurde, mit als ein Grund für den immensen Wahlerfolg der NSDAP bei der bald darauf erfolgenden Reichstagswahl vom Juli 1932 angesehen. In der Frage der Finanzierung von zu fördernden Projekten und in dem Grundsatz der tarifmäßigen Bezahlung stimmte das Strasser-Programm weitgehend mit dem späteren Gereke-Programm Schleichers überein: Dieser Umstand – beide von Elbrechter beratenen Spitzenpolitiker entwickeln ähnliche Wirtschaftsprogramme – bekräftigt die Annahme einer maßgeblichen Beteiligung seinerseits an diesen Programmen. Am 5. Januar 1933 setzte Elbrechter Schleicher – „Kurtchen“ – über die geheimen Verhandlungen von Hitler und Papen im Haus des Kölner Bankiers Kurt Freiherr von Schröder in Kenntnis („Fränzchen hat Sie verraten!“), die er durch den pensionierten Hauptmann Johansen hatte beschatten und durch Fotoaufnahmen belegen lassen. Die Aufnahmen veröffentlichte Hans Zehrer am 5. Januar in einem Enthüllungsbericht („Papen und Hitler gegen Schleicher“) in der Täglichen Rundschau, der das Kölner Treffen publik machte und der noch heute als eine journalistische Meisterleistung gilt. Wie genau Elbrechter von dem geplanten Treffen erfahren hatte, ist nicht vollständig gesichert: Treviranus gibt an, Elbrechter hätte „in seiner ärztlichen Praxis Gerüchte“ gehört, dass Papen mit Hitler „Tuchfühlung“ aufgenommen habe, und er habe Papen fortan beschatten lassen. Im gleichen Monat soll Elbrechter Schleicher den Vorschlag eines „kalten Staatsstreiches“ gemacht haben. Seine Idee sei es gewesen, den Reichstag ohne Zustimmung des Reichspräsidenten aufzulösen und bei Neuwahlen eine im Wesentlichen um Strasser gruppierte Gegenpartei zur NSDAP aufzubauen. Elbrechters Plan für einen „kalten Staatsstreich“ (1933) Anfang Januar 1933 unterbreitete Elbrechter von Schleicher einen von ihm, Elbrechter, unter Mitwisserschaft Hans Zehrers, ausgearbeiteten Plan für einen sogenannten „kalten Staatsstreich“ gegen den Reichspräsidenten, der die Bildung einer Regierung Hitler und/oder Papen verhindern sollte. Dieser sah vor, dass Schleicher die sich in seinem Besitz befindliche „Rote Mappe“, die die Auflösungsorder für den Reichstag enthielt, nutzen sollte, um den Reichstag ohne Unterschrift Hindenburgs aufzulösen. Die Unterschrift des Reichspräsidenten sollte Schleicher sich dann nachträglich, nachdem er diesen mit der Auflösung des Parlaments vor vollendete Tatsachen gestellt hatte, holen. Bei einer Neuwahl sollte eine von Gregor Strasser aufgestellte Gegenpartei zur NSDAP gegen diese antreten. Um eine solche ins Leben zu rufen, hatte Elbrechter nach eigenen Angaben auch bereits eine Versöhnung Strassers mit Ernst Röhm angebahnt. Elbrechter meinte später, ausgehend von seinen Kenntnissen der persönlichen Eigenschaften Hindenburgs und seiner Umgebung sicher sein zu können, dass der Plan sich „glatt und risikolos“ verwirklichen hätte lassen. Schleicher verwarf den Plan nach einer 48stündigen Bedenkzeit mit der Begründung, dass er als General „innerlich nicht in der Lage sei“, eine derartige Aktion gegen seinen Feldmarschall durchzuführen, so dass alle weiteren Bemühungen Elbrechters „aussichtslos“ geworden seien. Lebensrettend für ihn sei in den späteren Jahren gewesen, so Elbrechter in der Rückschau, dass keiner der Beteiligten eine Veranlassung hatte, etwas über diese seine „Ein-Mann-Aktion“ auszusagen. Zeit des Nationalsozialismus (1933 bis 1945) Nach der Regierungsübernahme Hitlers am 30. Januar 1933 schied Elbrechter aus der Redaktion der Tat aus. In den folgenden eineinhalb Jahren unterhielt er weiterhin Kontakt zu Gregor Strasser und Heinrich Brüning. Für den zuletzt genannten fungierte Elbrechter auch nach der einsetzenden Verfolgung durch die SA und Gestapo als Informant, indem er ihn in seinen Verstecken, so im Berliner Hedwigs-Krankenhaus, über die Vorgänge und Entwicklungen in der NSDAP informierte. In den Jahren 1933 und 1934 regte Elbrechter noch eine Versöhnung von Strasser mit Ernst Röhm an. Danach trat er politisch in den Hintergrund. Trotzdem wurde er in den ersten eineinhalb Jahren der NS-Herrschaft wiederholt durch die Gestapo verhört. Da die verhörenden Beamten „nicht zur geistigen Elite dieser Kategorie gehörten“, konnte er die „von den führenden NS-Kreisen nur geahnten Zusammenhänge [über die Vorgänge von 1932/1933] zunächst bagatellisieren und […] wider Erwarten den Mai 1945 erleben.“ Einer eidesstattlichen Erklärung von Heinrich Brüning aus dem Jahr 1953 zufolge war Elbrechter eine der Personen, die am 30. Juni 1934 zur Ermordung im Zuge der unter der als „Röhm-Putsch“ bekannt gewordenen politischen Säuberungsaktion der Nationalsozialisten vorgesehen waren. Er, Brüning, habe Elbrechter wiederholt gewarnt, sich dem seit Anfang Mai geplanten Massenmord von Gegnern des Hitler-Regimes durch Flucht zu entziehen. Dem Tod sei Elbrechter dann nur entgangen, weil er zufällig am 30. Juni 1934 nicht in Berlin anwesend war. Nach seinem unverhofften Überleben während des Röhm-Putsches floh Elbrechter, Brüning zufolge, nach Holland und lebte anschließend einige Jahre in London. Am 28. Dezember 1938 heiratete Elbrechter in Utrecht in zweiter Ehe die aus Chile stammende Carmen Margarete Elfriede Wünkhaus (* 14. Dezember 1905 in Lanco Conception; † 2. Januar 1967 in Essen-Werden). Aus der Ehe ging der Sohn Michael Elbrechter (* 13. April 1944 in Hamburg) hervor. In diesen Jahren habe er sich außerdem mit dem Plan getragen, nach Chile, die Heimat seiner Frau, auszuwandern. Bei Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkrieges habe Elbrechter sich in Holland befunden und sei von der holländischen Regierung nach Deutschland abgeschoben worden, wo man ihn sofort an der Grenze verhaftet und in das Gefängnis in der Prinz-Albrecht-Straße und später in das KZ Oranienburg gebracht. Später sei Elbrechter aus dem Konzentrationslager entlassen und für wehrunwürdig erklärt worden. Einer erneuten Verhaftung, besonders gegen Ende des Krieges, habe Elbrechter sich durch dauernden Ortswechsel entziehen können. Im Gegensatz zu der Erklärung Brünings stehen allerdings die Berliner Adressbücher für die Jahre 1934 bis 1940. Die Adressbücher für die Jahre 1934 bis 1940 verzeichnen Elbrechter nach wie vor als „Zahnarzt“ und geben weiterhin die Schaperstraße 29 als seinen Wohnort und als Sitz seiner Praxis an; 1940 nur seine Frau. Der Widerspruch zwischen Brünings Aussage und den Angaben der Adressbücher ergibt sich wahrscheinlich aus dem Umstand, dass die Adressbücher sich auf amtliche Daten stützten: Da Elbrechter sich vor seiner Flucht ins Ausland wahrscheinlich nicht offiziell abgemeldet hat, wurde er allem Anschein nach weiterhin als wohnhaft in der Berliner Schaperstraße geführt, so dass die Verfasser der Berliner Adressbücher, die auf die Daten der Melderegister zurückgriffen, diese den offiziellen – nicht aber den faktischen – Zustand widerspiegelnden Angabe aufnahmen. Die Adressbücher von 1941 und 1942 verzeichnen Elbrechter – im Einklang mit der Angabe, dass er nun nach Berlin zurückgekehrt sei – dann neuerdings als „Kaufm.“ (Kaufmann) mit einem neuen Wohnsitz in der Schaperstraße 22, nahe seiner alten Adresse in der Nr. 29. Späte Jahre (1945 bis nach 1967) Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg schulte Elbrechter vom Zahnarzt zum Allgemeinmediziner um: Nachdem er bereits während des Krieges, von 1941 bis 1945, Medizin an der Universität Hamburg studiert hatte, bestand er am 16. Dezember 1946 das Medizinische Staatsexamen. 1948 legte er an der medizinischen Fakultät der Hamburger Universität außerdem eine zweite Promotionsschrift – diesmal über das Thema Übersicht über das Carcinom im Kindesalter – vor, so dass er sich fortan Dr. Dr. (beziehungsweise Dr. med. dent. Dr. med.) nennen durfte. Seine Arbeit, die an der Universitäts-Kinderklinik Hamburg-Eppendorf entstanden war, wurde von Johann Baptists Mayer (1905–1981) betreut. Spätestens ab 1960 praktizierte Elbrechter als Arzt in Düsseldorf. Als Wohnsitz für diese Zeit ist unter anderem die Kühlwetterstraße 36 identifiziert worden. In seinen letzten Lebensjahren erteilte er noch verschiedenen Historikern wie Roger Manvell und Udo Kissenkoetter Auskunft über seine Tätigkeit und seine Erlebnisse in den 1920er und 1930er Jahren und erlaubte ihnen Einblick in seine persönlichen Unterlagen. Ein Teilnachlass Elbrechters lagert heute im Institut für Zeitgeschichte in München als Teil des Nachlasses von Paul Schulz. Der „Nachlass Elbrechter“ ist in Bd. 1 des besagten Nachlasses enthalten und enthält eine maschinenschriftliche Erklärung Elbrechters betreffend die Planungen für einen „kalten Staatsstreich“ bzw. die Aufstellung einer Gegenpartei zur NSDAP. |
G;|Ulrich Sporleder (* 7. Juli 1911 in Schwerte; † 23./24. Juli 1944 in Ostrów Lubelski bei Lublin, Polen) war ein deutscher evangelischer Geistlicher, Pfarrer der Bekennenden Kirche in Marienburg und Marienwerder, Offizier der deutschen Wehrmacht und Widerstandskämpfer gegen den Nationalsozialismus.  Familie und Kindheit Ulrich Sporleder wurde als zweites von drei Kindern in eine ursprünglich in Mecklenburg (Schloss/Rittergut Steinbeck bei Bellin) und Schlesien (Rittergut Reinshain) begüterte, teils monarchistisch-nationalkonservativ, teils christlich-sozial und sozialdemokratisch geprägte Gutsbesitzerfamilie hineingeboren. Friedrich Wilhelm Sporleder (1787–1875), Naturforscher und Konsistorialrat am gräflichen Konsistorium Wernigerode, zählt zu seinen Vorfahren, der ehemalige Oberbürgermeister von Herne Georg Sporleder ist sein Onkel, der Schriftsteller, Philologe und Psychologe Gerd Schimansky sein Schwager und der Opernsänger Kurt Manfred Sporleder (1915–1976) sein Bruder. Seine Jugend verbrachte er vorwiegend in Frankfurt am Main und auf Schloss Braunfels/Lahn. Durch seine Mutter Marie Anna Katharina Sporleder, die unter Freifrau von Hadeln auch Geschäftsführerin des monarchistischen Königin-Luise-Bundes war, kam er früh in Kontakt mit den christlichen Jugendbewegungen, so insbesondere mit der Marburger Michaelsbruderschaft als Teil der Berneuchener Bewegung. Zu seinen engen Weggefährten, Lehrern und Freunden gehörten neben Martin Niemöller, der 1939 Pate seines ersten Sohnes Martin wurde, Gerhard Ritter, Karl Bernhard Ritter, Hans Joachim Iwand, Horst Symanowski, Rudolf Bultmann und Hans Freiherr von Soden unter anderem auch hochrangige Offiziere der Reichswehr und späteren deutschen Wehrmacht. Studium und politische Tätigkeit Sporleder studierte nach dem in Wetzlar absolvierten Abitur, seit dem Sommersemester 1930 Theologie an der Universität Königsberg, wo er sich auch der Deutschen Akademischen Gildenschaft anschloss. Zum Wintersemester 1931/32 wollte Sporleder zu Karl Barth an die Universität Bonn wechseln, setzte sein Studium dann aber an der Universität Marburg unter anderem bei Hans Freiherr von Soden, Rudolf Bultmann und Wilhelm Maurer fort. Nach anfänglicher Skepsis meinte er die Intention Bultmanns hinsichtlich seines „Entscheidungsbegriffes“ verstanden zu haben und näherte sich seinen Positionen an. Als die Mitglieder der Königsberger Gilde Skuld ihn 1932 zum Gildemeister wählen wollen, befielen Sporleder Zweifel hinsichtlich seines Verhältnisses zur zunehmend unter völkischen Einfluss geratenen Gildenschaft. Zum Sommersemester 1932 kehrt er an die Universität Königsberg zurück, wo er u. a. bei den Professoren Hans Joachim Iwand und Martin Noth sein Theologiestudium fortsetzte. Zum Sommersemester 1933 ging er von dort an das Herder-Institut nach Riga und kehrte nach zwei Semestern erneut nach Königsberg zurück. Nun gehörte er an der Seite Iwands zu den maßgeblichen Kämpfern gegen die Schließung des dortigen Lutherheimes durch die Gestapo. Widerstand, Arbeit für die Bekennende Kirche und Haftzeit Im Sommer 1934 zum Fachschaftsleiter gewählt, nahm Sporleder am Wissenschaftslager der theologischen Fachschaft in Wormditt teil und verfasste anschließend das Vorwort zu den in der Reihe Bekennende Kirche publizierten Vorträgen von Julius Schniewind und Herbert Girgensohn. Sporleder vertrat hier die Ansicht, nicht die Theologiestudenten hätten sich außerhalb des Staates gestellt, sondern der NS-Staat selbst würde durch seinen totalitären Anspruch Ausgrenzung und Widerstand hervorrufen. Tatsächlich versuchten viele Theologiestudenten, darunter auch solche, die den Vordenkern der Barmer Theologischen Erklärung nahe standen, durch eine Mitgliedschaft in der SA nationale Gesinnung und sogar ihre Bereitschaft zur Mitwirkung am Aufbau eines nationalsozialistischen Deutschland zu demonstrieren, machten aber schnell die Erfahrung der Unvereinbarkeit von Nationalsozialismus und Christentum. Aufgrund dieser Situation wurde Sporleders Vorwort reichsweit schnell als „Manifest der Theologiestudenten“ jener Generation verstanden. Für den 9. November 1934 kündigte Sporleder eine Diskussion mit dem Professor Hans Michael Müller über dessen Buch Vom Staatsfeind im Audimax der Universität an. Kommilitonen wie Manfred Koschorke und Horst Symanowski beschrieben diese von Sporleder geprägten Diskussionen später als einen letzten Ort der Freiheit inmitten der Unfreiheit und des Gesinnungsterrors. Am 26. November 1934 erfolgte unter der Federführung Sporleders die Gründung der „Bruderschaft der Vikare und Hilfsprediger der ostpreußischen BK“ im Rahmen des „Zweiten Ostpreußischen Kirchentages“. Sporleder gehörte unter den Gründungsmitgliedern zum sog. „radikalen Flügel“ der „jungen Brüder“, der jegliche Zugeständnisse und Kompromisse gegenüber dem NS-Staat ablehnte. Folgerichtig forderte er in einer Sitzung des Ostpreußischen Bruderrates am 12. April 1935 eine kompromisslose Haltung und konsequentes Vorgehen gegen den sog. Rust-Erlass. Insbesondere sollte die Einflussnahme auf die Lehrstuhlbesetzungen an den Theologischen Fakultäten durch eindeutige Stellungnahmen offengelegt werden. Außerdem wollte Sporleder die in den Gottesdiensten der Bekenntnisgemeinden gehaltenen Fürbitten auf alle Häftlinge der Konzentrationslager ausweiten bzw. bezogen wissen. Gewöhnlich galten diese bis dato den verfolgten „Brüdern“ und weniger den katholischen, kommunistischen, jüdischen, kommunistischen, sozialdemokratischen oder anderen Mithäftlingen. Sporleder war auch maßgeblich an den Einladungen Martin Niemöllers nach Ostpreußen und der Organisation seiner damit verbundenen Vortragsreisen und Gastpredigten beteiligt. Niemöller wurde fortan sein väterlicher Freund und stand auch der Familie nahe. Von Dezember 1935 bis April 1936 war Sporleder auf Einladung von Albrecht Graf zu Stolberg-Wernigerode auf Schloss Dönhoffstädt als Hauslehrer tätig. Dort erfuhr er Schutz vor Verfolgung und erhielt zugleich die Gelegenheit, sich auf die Ablegung seines 1. Examens vor dem illegalen Prüfungsausschuss der ostpreußischen Bekenntnissynode vorzubereiten. Auf Schloss Dönhoffstädt verfasste er auch seine Examensarbeit zum Thema Rechtfertigung und Heiligung nach der Apologie. Vom 16. bis zum 19. März 1936 legte er als einer von 19 Kandidaten sein erstes Theologisches Examen bei der Bekennenden Kirche in Ostpreußen ab. Am 25. April 1936 war er Mitglied des Förderausschusses zum Wissenschaftslager der Theologischen Fachschaft in Tilsit und reiste am 15. Juni 1936 zum Studententag nach Posen. In diese Zeit fällt eine von ihm verfasste Predigt über Heb 12,1–6 LUT, in der er als Reaktion auf die Nürnberger Rassegesetze unter dem Wort „heute sind wir (Christen und Juden) mehr denn je ein Geschlecht (d.h. aus dem Geschlechte Davids)“ zu Kampf und Widerstand aufrief. Vom 1. Mai 1936 an wirkte er bis zu seiner Beurlaubung zum Reichsheer am 17. Oktober 1936 als Vikar in Heilsberg/Ostpreußen. Seine Ausbildung als Offiziersanwärter erhielt er bei einem der traditionsreichen Husarenregimenter Ostpreußens. Im Anschluss war er Vikar bei Pfarrer Werner Lehmbruch in Rehhof und als Prädikant in Marienwerder tätig, wo ihm der Aufbau einer neuen Bekenntnisgemeinde gelang. Am 14. November 1937 predigte Sporleder im Rahmen eines so genannten Kirchentages der Bekennenden Kirche gemeinsam mit Lehmbruch und weiteren Pfarrern, Hilfspredigern und Prädikanten in verschiedenen Kirchen Elbings. Im Anschluss wurde er erstmals von der Gestapo zusammen mit Werner Lehmbruch und sechs weiteren Amtsbrüdern festgenommen und bis zum 21. November 1937 zunächst im Gestapo- und zuletzt im Gerichtsgefängnis Elbing inhaftiert. Seine Predigten, Telefongespräche und der Briefverkehr wurden bereits seit einiger Zeit überwacht und dienten nun zur Begründung der Untersuchungshaft und der Anklageerhebung. Am 7. und 14. Dezember 1937 wurde er als letzter „Schutz- und Untersuchungshäftling“ („Nr. 87“) auf der reichsweiten Fürbittenliste der Bekennenden Kirche genannt, die von Pfarrer Martin Niemöller („Nr. 1“) als „persönlicher Gefangener Hitlers“ angeführt wurde. Hilfsprediger der Bekennenden Kirche in Marienburg und Marienwerder (Westpr.) Nach seiner Haftentlassung setzte sich Heinrich Graf zu Dohna-Schlobitten als Mitglied des Ostpreußischen Bruderrates dafür ein, dass Sporleder zum 1. Mai 1938 als Nachfolger Helmut Passauers zum Hilfsprediger der Bekennenden Kirche in Marienburg ernannt wurde. Dort stand er ebenso wie sein Vorgänger als einziger Bekenntnisgeistlicher vier „Deutsch-Christlichen“ Pfarrern gegenüber. In diese Zeit fallen auch erste intensivere Kontakte zu späteren Mitgliedern des militärischen Widerstands. Seine Gottesdienste wurden regelmäßig von Spitzeln der Gestapo besucht und er wurde auch mehrfach von Gemeindemitgliedern wegen des Inhalts seiner Predigten und seines Konfirmandenunterrichts denunziert. Am 7./8. Juli 1938 heiratete er in Lauenburg/Pommern Annemarie Weissenborn, eine Tochter des ehemaligen Oberbürgermeisters von Halberstadt. Durch seinen Schwager Gerd Schimansky und dessen Freund Willy Kramp erhielt Sporleder Kontakt zum oppositionellen Schriftsteller Ernst Wiechert, der Lehrer Schimanskys am Hufengymnasium in Königsberg war. Wegen der Sammlung von Kollekten für die Bekennende Kirche und Predigtfürbitten für gemaßregelte und inhaftierte Pfarrer stand er im Herbst des Jahres 1938 in zwei Prozessen als Angeklagter vor dem Reichsgericht. Nachdem er in der Marienkirche im Silvestergottesdienst 1938 die Novemberpogrome gegen die jüdische Bevölkerung scharf angeprangert und für die Verfolgten gebetet hatte, wurde er auf gemeinsames Betreiben des Konsistoriums, des Reichskirchenministeriums und der Gestapo Anfang 1939 rückwirkend zum 31. Dezember 1938 seines Amtes enthoben und mit Redeverbot belegt. Als Reaktion auf die Amtsenthebung gingen beim Konsistorium in Königsberg und den staatlichen Stellen mehr als 200 Protestschreiben von Mitgliedern der Marienburger Bekenntnisgemeinde ein. Daraufhin wurde ihm zugestanden, die von Passauer übernommenen Konfirmanden bis zu ihrer Konfirmation im Frühjahr 1939 weiter unterrichten zu dürfen. Predigt und Zutritt zur Marienburger Georgenkirche wurden ihm jedoch untersagt und deren Nutzung für Bekenntnisgottesdienste nunmehr generell verboten. Die Gemeinde hielt ihre Gottesdienste daraufhin unter der Leitung Sporleders in den Privatwohnungen der Marienburger Gemeindemitglieder im Verborgenen. Offizier einer Panzerjägereinheit, Treffen mit Bonhoeffer, „Retterwiderstand“ und Militärischer Widerstand Am 26. August 1939 wurde Sporleder zur Wehrmacht einberufen und nahm er als Offizier einer im Wehrkreis I aufgestellten Panzerjägereinheit, die zur „Gruppe Brandt“, 3. Armee gehörte, am Polenfeldzug teil. Die frühzeitige Einberufung wurde von einflussreichen Freunden befördert, um ihn vor einer drohenden erneuten Inhaftierung und Einweisung in ein KZ zu schützen. In Berlin waren dennoch weiterhin zwei politische Verfahren gegen ihn anhängig. Während seines Weihnachturlaubs legte Sporleder im Januar 1940 sein durch die Einberufung unterbrochenes 2. Examen ab und wurde anschließend in Königsberg ordiniert. Den vom Konsistorium geforderten „Führereid“ lehnte er wie zuvor weiterhin ab. Seit dem 10. Mai 1940 erfolgte Sporleders Einsatz als Leutnant in einer schweren Panzerjägereinheit beim Frankreichfeldzug im Rahmen der so genannten Panzergruppe von Kleist. Am 1. Mai 1940 wurde er mit dem Eisernen Kreuz 1. Klasse ausgezeichnet und im Juni 1940 schwer verwundet. Im Anschluss an einen Lazarettaufenthalt in Augsburg wollte er Mitte Juli nach Marienburg reisen. Dort war er mit Dietrich Bonhoeffer verabredet, der nach Abschluss seiner Visitationsreise durch Ostpreußen in Abänderung seiner ursprünglichen Reiseroute von Danzig nach Berlin laut eigenhändigem Kalendereintrag vom 25. bis zum 26. Juli 1940 einen Aufenthalt bei Ulrich Sporleder in Marienburg und Marienwerder plante. Zu dieser Zeit korrespondierte Sporleder über offiziellen Schreiben beigefügte und codierte Artikel u. a. aus der Schweizer Radiozeitung mit Kontaktleuten in der Schweiz. Während des Krieges gegen die Sowjetunion war er zuletzt als Hauptmann Kommandant einer mit den Panzertypen „Sturer Emil“, „Dicker Max“, „Elefant“ und „Hornisse“ bzw. „Nashorn“ ausgerüsteten schweren Panzerjäger-Kompanie bzw. Abteilung (521./655.). Seiner Marienburger Bekenntnisgemeinde sandte er von der Front immer wieder Texte, die von Gemeindemitgliedern oder Familienangehörigen, wie seiner Schwägerin Eva Schimansky geb. Weissenborn, verlesen wurden. Im Pfarrhaus seines Schwagers in Lauenburg bildete sich zudem ein oppositioneller Kreis von Zuhörern, dem auch Generalstabsoffiziere des Heeres angehörten. Aufgrund einer zu Weihnachten 1941 an der Ostfront gehaltenen Predigt und Ansprache drohte 1942 Sporleders erneute Verhaftung und eine Anklage vor dem Reichskriegsgericht. Einer Verurteilung durch das Reichskriegsgericht konnte Sporleder wahrscheinlich durch Protektion von Seiten hoher Offiziere und einflussreicher Juristen entgehen. Am 1. April zum Oberleutnant d. R. befördert, stand er Anfang Oktober 1942 mit seiner Panzerjägerabteilung vor Stalingrad und wurde in den dortigen Kämpfen schwer verwundet. Zur Genesung konnte er nach Marienburg zurückkehren, wo er sogleich den Dienst in der Gemeinde wieder aufnahm und sich gemeinsam mit seiner Frau, Werner Lehmbruch und Horst Symanowski sowie weiteren Helfern an der Organisation einer ostpreußischen „Pfarrhauskette“ zur Rettung der von Deportationen bedrohten Berliner Juden beteiligte. Das Berliner Büro der Gossner-Mission unter Hans Lokies (1895–1982) und Eberhard Bethge diente dabei als Anlaufstelle und die Marienburger Wohnung der Familie Sporleder im Mühlengraben 5 gehörte ebenso wie verschiedene Pfarrhäuser und das Haus Lehmbruchs in Rehhof zu den von Horst Symanowski so bezeichneten „heimlichen Behausungen“. Eine Berliner Jüdin wurde in Sporleders Wohnung wegen fehlender Ausweichquartiere länger als geplant versteckt, überlebte den Holocaust und lebte später zunächst in Schweden und dann in den USA. Bis März 1943 absolvierte Sporleder einen Offizierslehrgang bei der Standortverwaltung der Wehrmacht in Danzig, und nahm anschließend als Kompaniechef der 521./1 schw. Panzerjäger-Abteilung am „Unternehmen Zitadelle“ teil. Bei den auf die Gegenoffensive der Roten Armee folgenden Abwehrkämpfen wurde Sporleder am 14. Juli 1943 erneut schwer verwundet. Nach der Behandlung in den Feldlazaretten Minsk und Warschau hielt er sich von August bis November 1943 zur Genesung in Marienburg auf und setzte dort ebenso wie in Lauenburg und Berlin seine Widerstandstätigkeit fort. Am 1. Dezember 1943 wurde Sporleder zum Hauptmann befördert und zur Führung seiner schweren Panzerjägerabteilung an die Ostfront bei Smolensk abkommandiert. Am 13. Juli 1944 wurde er unter Major Karl Max Freiherr von Hofenfels (1908–1944) stellvertretender Kommandeur einer östlich von Lublin aufgestellten Kampfgruppe. Seine Ehefrau erhielt zu dieser Zeit den Hinweis, Marienburg zu verlassen und sich mit den Kindern an einen sicheren Ort im Harz zu begeben. Am 15. Juli 1944 wurde um 13 Uhr für Sporleders Einheit der Befehl zum „Unternehmen Marbach“ ausgegeben, die dann jedoch verschoben wurde. Am 20. Juli, dem Tag des Hitler-Attentates, nahm die Abteilung mit ihren schweren Panzerjägern entgegen anders lautendem Befehl über das KZ Majdanek Kurs auf das Stadtzentrum von Lublin, das als „Fester Platz“ zu diesem Zeitpunkt unter dem Kommando von SS-Gruppenführer Hilmar Moser stand. In der Stadt wurden die Verpflegungslager der SS und die Oberfeldkommandantur von Sporleders Einheit besetzt. Von dort erging in der Folge der Befehl zur Entlassung der letzten Häftlinge aus dem KZ Majdanek. Welche Rolle Sporleder dabei zukam, ist unbekannt, da die unter dem Datum vom 19. bis 25. Juli verzeichneten Einträge des Kriegstagebuches, wohl in der Folge des 20. Juli, vernichtet wurden. Nachdem v. Hofenfels und Sporleder in der Nacht vom 23. auf den 24. Juli große Teile ihrer Einheit aus der bereits fast eingeschlossenen Stadt in südwestlicher Richtung herausgeführt hatten, blieben sie zwischen den Fronten zurück und töteten sich nach Angaben eines Augenzeugen gemeinsam mit vier weiteren Offizieren durch Kopfschüsse selbst. Sporleder zählte zu den wenigen Mitgliedern der Bekennenden Kirche, die dem „Retterwiderstand“ angehörten und zudem über persönliche Kontakte zu Angehörigen des Militärischen Widerstandes und anderer Widerstandsgruppen wie dem Kreisauer Kreis verfügten. In dem letzten Brief an seine Mutter vom 3. Juli 1944 schreibt Sporleder: „Es sieht ja nach außen wahrlich so aus, als habe Gott seine Herrschaft abgetreten an die dunklen Mächte dieser Erde […]. Aber in Wahrheit führt sein Weg ja nur durch das Kreuz zur Auferstehung.“ |
G;|Dame Ethel Mary Smyth (* 23. April 1858 in Sidcup; † 8. Mai 1944 in Woking) war eine englische Komponistin, Dirigentin, Schriftstellerin und eine der Mitkämpferinnen der britischen Suffragetten. Ethel Smyths Leben war wesentlich davon geprägt, sich als Komponistin durchzusetzen und als solche Anerkennung in der Öffentlichkeit zu finden. Sie hatte den Anspruch, in ihrer Arbeit nicht als nebenher komponierende Lady, sondern als gleichwertig zu ihren männlichen Kollegen gesehen zu werden und von ihrer Arbeit zu leben. Ihre Kompositionen umfassen sinfonische Werke, Kammermusik, Chorwerke und Opern. Ihre bekannteste Oper ist The Wreckers (deutsch Strandrecht). Ihr bekanntestes Werk ist allerdings The March of Women, das zu einer Hymne der englischen Frauenbewegung wurde.  Familie und frühe Erziehung Ethel Smyth entstammt einer typischen viktorianischen Familie der oberen Mittelschicht, deren männliche Mitglieder – wenn sie nicht die militärische Laufbahn einschlugen – Karriere als Bischof, Kaufmann oder Bankier machten. Ihr Vater John H. Smyth war Generalmajor und diente lange in der bengalischen Armee. Ungewöhnlicher war ihre Mutter Nina Struth, die ihre Jugend in Paris verbracht hatte und besser Französisch als Englisch sprach. Gemeinsam mit fünf Schwestern und einem Bruder wuchs Ethel in der Nähe der englischen Ortschaft Sidcup auf. Die sechs Schwestern wurden von deutschen Gouvernanten erzogen, darunter eine, die ein vollständiges Klavierstudium am Leipziger Konservatorium absolviert hatte. Unter dem Einfluss dieser Gouvernante lernte Ethel die Musik Beethovens, Schuberts und Schumanns kennen, und in ihr reifte der Wunsch heran, gleichfalls in Leipzig Musik zu studieren. Sie war ein temperamentvolles, eigenwilliges Kind: Mit vierzehn Jahren wurde sie kurzzeitig in ein Mädchenpensionat geschickt, weil sie daheim als „unmanageable“ (nicht beherrschbar) galt. Nach Hause zurückkehren durfte sie, nachdem zwei ihrer Schwestern für Töchter ihrer Schicht angemessene Ehen eingegangen waren. Ethel wurde daheim benötigt, um bei der Aufsicht über die übrigen drei Schwestern behilflich zu sein. Smyths Wunsch, Musik zu studieren, wurde daheim entschieden abgelehnt. Ihre Kontakte zu einem Ehepaar – er war Musiker, sie Schriftstellerin –, mit denen sie Wagnerpartituren und die Berliozsche Instrumentationslehre studierte, wurden vom Vater rüde unterbunden. Immerhin gestattete ihre Familie, dass sie in London Clara Schumann Werke von Johannes Brahms spielen hören konnte. 1877 erkämpfte sie sich endlich die Zustimmung ihrer Familie, in Leipzig Musik studieren zu dürfen. Vorausgegangen war ein Psychoterror ihrerseits: Mit Hungerstreik, eisigem Schweigen und der Verweigerung der Aktivitäten, die einer jungen Lady ihrer Schicht eigentlich anstanden – nämlich Kirch-, Dinner- und Ballbesuchen –, setzte sie ihre Absicht durch. Die Musikwissenschaftlerin Eva Rieger macht deutlich, wie ungewöhnlich diese Pläne waren: Immerhin war es in Leipzig möglich, als Frau überhaupt Komposition zu studieren – ihrer Zeitgenossin Sabine Lepsius, die an der Berliner Musikhochschule studierte, wurde dort der Zutritt zur Kompositionsklasse verwehrt. Am Leipziger Konservatorium Das Leipziger Konservatorium enttäuschte sie. Die Lehrer (darunter Carl Reinecke, der sie in Kompositionslehre unterrichtete) schienen ihr nicht ernsthaft genug: Sie kamen zu spät zum Unterricht, interessierten sich nicht wirklich für die von den Studenten vorgelegten Kompositionen und schienen lieber den Unterricht mit Anekdoten als mit wirklichem Inhalt zu würzen. Wichtiger als der Unterricht am Leipziger Konservatorium wurde daher der Kreis der Musiker, in dem sie sich nun bewegen konnte, nachdem sie die engen Fesseln ihrer Familie abgelegt hatte. Nach wie vor galten für sie jedoch auch die gesellschaftlichen Konventionen ihrer Zeit, die sie in ihrer unkonventionellen Art gelegentlich trickreich unterlief: Sehr engen Kontakt hatte Smyth anfangs zu der Familie Röntgen. Engelbert Röntgen, Leiter des Leipziger Gewandhausorchesters, ermutigte sie, in ihren Kompositionen fortzufahren, indem er das Rondothema ihrer ersten Klaviersonate mit Kompositionen von Mozart verglich. Auch das wohlhabende, kinderlose Ehepaar Herzogenberg förderte sie stark: Als sie nach einem Jahr Studium das Leipziger Konservatorium verließ, nahm sie bei Heinrich Aloysius von Herzogenberg, dem Präsidenten des Leipziger Bachvereins, Privatunterricht. Die Herzogenbergs nahmen sie gleichsam als Ersatztochter an. Die Bindung zu der 11 Jahre älteren Elisabeth von Herzogenberg war jedoch noch wesentlich enger: Die beiden verband ein Liebesverhältnis, das Heinrich von Herzogenberg entweder ignorierte oder nicht wahrnahm. Im Hause der Herzogenbergs nahm Smyth sehr intensiv am Kulturleben von Leipzig teil. Sie lernte Clara Schumann, Anton Rubinstein, Max Friedländer, Edvard Grieg und Johannes Brahms persönlich kennen und war mit der jüngsten Tochter von Mendelssohn, Lili Wach, eng befreundet. Insbesondere Brahms verkehrte viel im Hause der Herzogenbergs. Zu Brahms, der komponierenden Frauen gegenüber starke Vorbehalte hatte, entwickelte sie jedoch ein distanziertes Verhältnis: Einerseits bewunderte sie ihn, andererseits war seine ablehnende Haltung gegenüber Komponistinnen verletzend. Begegnung mit Henry Brewster Im Herbst 1882 zog Smyth für eine kurze Zeit nach Florenz, wo die Schwester von Elisabeth von Herzogenberg, Julia Brewster, lebte. Das Verhältnis zu Julia Brewster war anfangs sehr innig. Julia Brewsters Ehemann, der wohlhabende Literat Henry Brewster, verliebte sich jedoch bald heftig in die eigentlich eher lesbisch orientierte Smyth. Zwischen Julia und Henry Brewster kam es daraufhin zum Bruch, der auch dazu führte, dass sich Elisabeth von Herzogenberg von Smyth abwendete. Unter diesem Bruch litt Smyth sehr intensiv. Sie versuchte bis 1890, ihre Freundin Elisabeth von Herzogenberg zurückzugewinnen und erst nach Elisabets Tod im Jahre 1892 vertiefte Ethel ihre Beziehung zu Henry Brewster. Diese blieb jedoch noch mehrere Jahre rein platonisch. In ihrer Autobiografie What happened next schildert sie mit entwaffnender Offenheit, wie sie sich 1895 dazu entschloss, auch sexuell eine Beziehung mit Henry Brewster einzugehen, und spricht von einer „erhabenen Kapitulation“ ihrerseits. Die enge Beziehung zu Henry Brewster hielt bis zu seinem Tode 1908 an. Der Opernfreund Henry Brewster brachte sie darüber hinaus dieser Kunstform näher und sollte für Smyth alle ihre zukünftigen Opernlibretti schreiben. Begegnung mit Tschaikowski Die Entwicklung bis zu den ersten öffentlichen Erfolgen Anfang der 1890er Jahre war für Ethel Smyth durch eine Reihe von Misserfolgen geprägt. Die deutschsprachigen Lieder und Balladen, die in England in den 1880er Jahren aufgeführt wurden, fanden keinen Widerhall, und Joseph Joachim ließ sich herablassend über ihre kammermusikalischen Kompositionen aus. 1887 kehrte sie nach Leipzig zurück und begegnete dort dem russischen Komponisten Pjotr I. Tschaikowski. Er beeinflusste ihre weitere kompositorische Entwicklung und regte sie an, sich vor allem auf dem Gebiet der Instrumentationslehre weiter auszubilden, was dazu führte, dass sie sich zunehmend großer Orchestermusik zuwandte. Die Instrumentation war während ihrer ersten Zeit in Leipzig vernachlässigt worden – in ihrer Biografie begründet sie dies damit, dass ihre Lehrer wesentlich von Brahms beeinflusst waren und für diesen die Instrumentation keine große Rolle spielte. Über Herzogenberg, der sie so maßgeblich in ihrer frühen Zeit beeinflusste, schrieb sie später, seine Instrumentierungen seien so miserabel gewesen, dass sie seine orchestrierten Stücke, mit denen sie als Klavierduos bestens vertraut war, kaum wiedererkannte. Uraufführung der Messe in D Ethel Smyths erster großer Erfolg, die Messe in D (englisch Mass in D), war die musikalische Verarbeitung einer heftigen Verliebtheit in die römisch-katholische Pauline Trevelyan. Die Messe in D ist eines ihrer wichtigsten Werke, sie selbst hielt es für ihre beste Arbeit. Die Uraufführung der Messe in der Royal Albert Hall in London verdankte sie jedoch letztlich ihren gesellschaftlichen Beziehungen. Zu den Bekannten der Familie gehörte auch die exilierte französische Kaiserin Eugénie de Montijo, die mit der Messe wohlvertraut war, da ein Teil des Werkes entstanden war, als Smyth zu Gast in ihrem Ferienhaus war. Sie arrangierte, dass Smyth Königin Viktoria und ihrem Hofstaat auf Schloss Balmoral Teile der Messe vorspielen durfte – ein Erlebnis, zu dem Smyth angesichts der dort allgegenwärtigen Schottenmuster auch anmerkte, dass es „schmerzhafter ästhetischer Konzessionen bedarf, Königin von Schottland zu sein“. Dieses Vorspiel und die Zusage Eugénies sowie mehrerer Mitglieder des britischen Königshauses, der Uraufführung beizuwohnen, sorgten dafür, dass sich die Konzertleitung der Royal Albert Hall bereit fand, die Messe der noch weitgehend unbekannten Komponistin im März 1893 zur Aufführung zu bringen. Die Aufführung war ein Erfolg, George Bernard Shaw schrieb eine begeisterte Kritik, während ein anderer Kritiker sich darüber amüsierte, „eine Komponistin zu sehen, die versucht, in dem hochfliegenden Bereiche der musikalischen Kunst zu steigen.“ Die ersten Opernaufführungen Trotz dieses Erfolges war es für Ethel Smyth schwierig, ein Opernhaus zu finden, das bereit war, ihre ersten Opern aufzuführen. Da es in Großbritannien nur eine einzige professionelle Opernbühne gab, versuchte sie ihr Stück an einem der vielen deutschen Opernhäuser zur Aufführung zu bringen. Die anstrengende Rundreise zu den deutschen Bühnen absorbierte einen Großteil ihrer künstlerischen Energie: Wenn sie vor Ort Dirigenten fand, die ihre Werke aufführen wollten, fehlte es an Zustimmung seitens der Intendanz. Nachdem es ihr jedoch gelungen war, Großherzog Carl Alexander in Weimar für ihr Werk zu interessieren, kam ihre Oper Fantasio 1889 am Hoftheater Weimar zur Uraufführung. Wie Eva Weissweiler schrieb, war der Publikumserfolg beträchtlich, aber die aus allen Teilen Deutschlands zugereisten Kritiker ergingen sich in den üblichen Klischees. Nur die Orchestrierung wurde gelobt. Trotz einer hervorragenden Aufführung drei Jahre später begann sie an ihrem Werk so zu zweifeln, dass sie ihre Komposition im Garten ihres englischen Landhäuschens verbrannte. Die Uraufführung der Oper Der Wald fand 1902 an der Staatsoper Berlin statt, fand dort jedoch kein begeistertes Publikum. Der Wald wurde noch im selben Jahr am Royal Opera House Covent Garden in London aufgeführt und ein Jahr später an der Metropolitan Opera in New York herausgebracht. Die Premiere in New York war ein voller Erfolg – ein Kritiker schrieb über den Abend: Die schwierige Aufgabe, Bühnen zu finden, die ihre Opern aufführten, setzte sich trotz der erfolgreichen Aufführungen weiterhin fort. Zu den Personen, die sie persönlich überzeugen wollte, gehörte unter anderem auch der berühmte Dirigent Bruno Walter, der über die erste Begegnung mit ihr schrieb: Aus dieser Begegnung entwickelte sich eine lebenslange Freundschaft. In Wien brachte Bruno Walter ihre Oper The Wreckers zwar nicht zur Aufführung, aber er dirigierte das Vorspiel zum zweiten Akt dieser Oper häufiger in Konzerten und dirigierte die Oper 1910 in London. Ethel Smyth und die englische Frauenbewegung In ihrem autobiografischen Buch What Happened Next schrieb Ethel Smyth: Smyth entzog sich jedoch lange der Unterstützung der Frauenbewegung. Sie hielt ein politisches Engagement für unvereinbar mit ihrer künstlerischen Kreativität und verließ England 1908, um nicht in die zunehmend radikaleren Auseinandersetzungen um das Frauenwahlrecht hineingezogen zu werden. Sowohl die englische Frauenrechtlerin Emmeline Pankhurst als auch Rhoda Garrett hatten schon zuvor versucht, Smyth für ihre Sache zu gewinnen. Erst der Tod von Henry Brewster 1908, der bei ihr eine längere persönliche Krise auslöste, und lange Diskussionen mit dem Wiener Dramatiker Hermann Bahr und seiner Frau Anna von Mildenburg, einer berühmten Wagnerinterpretin, führten dazu, dass sich Smyth 1910 mit aller Konsequenz den militanten englischen Frauenrechtlerinnen anschloss und Mitglied der Organisation The Women’s Social and Political Union wurde. Sie vernachlässigte in dieser Zeit ihre kompositorische Arbeit jedoch nicht vollkommen. 1910 entstanden ihre drei Sonnenaufgangslieder, deren drittes, The March of Women, zur Hymne und zum Kampflied dieser Bewegung wurde. Die Uraufführung dieses Liedes fand am 21. Januar 1911 anlässlich einer Zeremonie an der Pall Mall in London statt. Als Protest gegen die Verweigerung des Frauenwahlrechts provozierte Smyth bewusst ihre Verhaftung und eine anschließende zweimonatige Gefängnisstrafe, indem sie am 12. März 1912 die Fensterscheiben des britischen Kolonialsekretariats einwarf. Sie war damit Teil einer Gemeinschaftsaktion von insgesamt 150 bis 200 Frauen, die zum Zeichen ihres Kampfeswillens um das Frauenwahlrecht rund um die Londoner Oxford Street nahezu sämtliche Scheiben zerstörten. Der Dirigent Thomas Beecham besuchte sie im Holloway Prison, in dem Smyth mit zahlreichen weiteren englischen Frauenrechtlerinnen inhaftiert war. Über diesen Besuch schrieb er: Smyth widmete zwei Jahre ihres Lebens intensiv den Zielen der britischen Frauenrechtsbewegung und unterstützte diese bis zum Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs. Zur Unterstützung der Kriegsanstrengungen unterbrachen die Frauenrechtlerinnen während des Weltkriegs ihre Aktivitäten; nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg wurde ihnen das Wahlrecht zugesprochen. Der Beitrag von Smyth zur Emanzipation der Frau liegt sicherlich nicht nur in ihrem aktiven Kampf für das Frauenwahlrecht. Bereits im Dezember 1911 schrieb Richard Specht in Der Merker über Smyth: Auch Virginia Woolf sah Smyth in dieser Rolle. In einer Rede vor der „National Society for Womens’s Service“ im Jahre 1931 sagte sie über ihre Freundin Smyth: 1913–1944 Nach zwei Jahren intensiven Mitkämpfens in der englischen Suffragettenbewegung wandte sich Ethel Smyth wieder verstärkt dem Komponieren zu. Da erste Anzeichen auftraten, dass ihr Gehör in Mitleidenschaft gezogen war, fuhr sie 1913 auf Anraten ihrer Ärzte nach Ägypten und begann dort an ihrer neuen Oper The Boatswain’s Mate zu arbeiten. Die Zeit des Ersten Weltkriegs verbrachte Smyth überwiegend in Frankreich. Sie arbeitete von 1915 bis 1918 als Röntgenassistentin in der Nähe von Vichy. Der Krieg hatte tiefgreifende Auswirkungen auf ihr künstlerisches Schaffen: Ihre Oper The Boatswain’s Mate sollte in der Saison 1914/1915 am Frankfurter Opernhaus aufgeführt werden, und Bruno Walter wollte The Wreckers in München zur Aufführung bringen. Aufgrund des Kriegsausbruchs im August 1914 kam es nicht zu den geplanten Aufführungen. In Vichy begann sie das erste ihrer autobiographischen Werke zu schreiben, das sofort nach Erscheinen ein großer Erfolg war und den Nebeneffekt hatte, dass aufgrund der so erzielten Popularität nach 1920 viele ihrer Kompositionen aufgeführt wurden, dass Rundfunkproduktionen mit ihren Arbeiten entstanden und Thomas Beecham The Prison für die BBC produzierte. The Prison war ihr Spätwerk und entstand trotz fortgeschrittener Taubheit. Mit dieser Symphonie für Soli, Chor und Orchester wollte Smyth die Lebensphilosophie ihres langjährigen Freundes Henry Brewster bekanntmachen. In ihren letzten Lebensjahren wandte sie sich fast ausschließlich dem Schreiben zu. Sie fühlte sich sehr heftig zu der 24 Jahre jüngeren Virginia Woolf hingezogen, der sie jahrelang fast täglich schrieb. Woolf spottete häufig über sie. In einem Brief an Vita Sackville-West schrieb Woolf beispielsweise über ihre Freundin: „Ethels neuer Hund ist tot. Die Wahrheit ist, kein Hund kann die Anstrengung aushalten, mit Ethel zu leben“. Gleichzeitig war die Beziehung für beide jedoch bereichernd. Ethel Smyth starb 1944 im Alter von 86 Jahren im Vollbesitz ihrer geistigen Kräfte, wenige Tage, nachdem sie anlässlich der Einweihung eines Denkmals für ihre längst verstorbene Freundin Emmeline Pankhurst die Londoner Metropolitan Police Band dirigiert hatte. |
G;|Christoph Bernhard von Galen (* 12. Oktober 1606 auf Haus Bisping bei Rinkerode in Westfalen; † 19. September 1678 in Ahaus) war katholischer Priester und vom 14. November 1650 bis zu seinem Tode Fürstbischof von Münster. Er wurde beigesetzt in der St.-Josephs-Kapelle im St.-Paulus-Dom zu Münster.         Wie die meisten münsterischen Bischöfe seit dem Mittelalter residierte Christoph Bernhard von Galen wechselnd auf den Amtsburgen in Ahaus, Horstmar, Sassenberg und Wolbeck, meistens aber in Coesfeld. Dort ließ er von 1652 bis 1656 vor dem Viehtor die nach dem ersten münsterischen Bischof benannte St.-Ludgerus-Burg bauen. Doch die Pläne des Bischofs wurden nie ganz ausgeführt. Nach seinem Tod ließ man die Festung verfallen. Nur wenige Reste der ehemaligen Zitadelle haben sich im Stadtbild erhalten (Straßennamen: Burgwall, Burgring, Am Ravellin). Galens militärische Eroberungen gingen allerdings später wieder verloren. Abwehr äußerer Feinde Galens strebte zuallererst nach der Ausweisung der auswärtigen protestantischen Truppen aus dem Umland, die nach dem Krieg noch immer das Land besetzt hielten. Hessen lagen in Coesfeld, Oranier in Bevergern und Schweden in Vechta. Der Westfälische Friedensvertrag hatte sehr hohe Geldzahlungen festgelegt, doch es gelang Galen, die Gelder für die Auszahlung der Hessen aufzubringen, sodass sie am 8. Juli 1651 aus Coesfeld abrückten. Nach dem Ende des Dreißigjährigen Krieges hatten sich auf der Bevergerner Burg die Oranier festgesetzt, die Galen unbedingt zurückbekommen wollte. Neuerlichen Krieg durch den Einsatz eines Entsatzheeres zog der Fürstbischof nicht ernsthaft in Erwägung. Stattdessen schaffte er es mithilfe der berühmt gewordenen sieben Landsknechte am 28. August 1652, die Burg ohne Blutvergießen, nur mit einer List, zurückzubekommen. Weitaus schwieriger war die Rückgewinnung der Stadt Vechta. Ende des Jahres 1653 nahm Galen auch deswegen am Regensburger Reichstag teil. Nachdem die Stadt Münster 50.000 Taler vorgeschossen hatte, zogen die Schweden tatsächlich am 13. Mai 1654 ab. Der Bischof erinnerte durch Schenkungen und Spenden an das Stift an seine militärisch-politische Stärke. Er ließ keine Gelegenheit aus, um seine Kompetenzen pompös darzustellen. Aus der kaiserlichen Armee des Dreißigjährigen Kriegs in Westfalen hatte Galen 1651 für sein Gebiet 1500 Soldaten rekrutiert, die er 1654 zu einer Streitmacht von 3000 Mann aufstockte, um sich gegen die protestantischen Nachbarn zu behaupten. Vor allem die expandierenden Niederländer waren Galen ein Dorn im Auge. Die Verteidigung war Aufgabe der Landesfürsten. Daher legte Galen verschiedene Zitadellen an, um die Landstände zum Unterhalt eines stärkeren Heeres zu zwingen: bei Coesfeld, das er als Residenz erwählte, die Ludgerusburg, die Zitadelle von Münster und die Zitadelle Vechta. Seine Garnisonen lagen zeitweilig überall verteilt im Stift. Warendorf, Rheine und Meppen erhielten neue Festungen. Galens Außenpolitik konzentrierte sich immer wieder auf seinen Erbfeind: die kalvinistisch geprägte Republik der Vereinigten Niederlande. Von den Niederländern wurde er auch „Bommen Berend“ („Bomben-Bernd“) genannt, da er sich als Bischof im Kriegsgewand intensiv auf die Bombardierung mithilfe von Mörsergeschossen konzentrierte. Unter dem Vorwand, mit der Eintreibung von Abfindungsgeldern für das Harlingerland beauftragt zu sein, ließ der Bischof Dezember 1663 seine Truppen in Ostfriesland einmarschieren. Unter Oberst Elverfeld wurden die Hampoeler und die Dieler Schanze erobert. Zur Unterstützung niederländischer Katholiken ließ er im Grenzgebiet Missionsstationen errichten. Im September 1665 ging Galen ein Bündnis mit dem englischen König Charles II. ein, der Verbündete im von ihm losgetretenen Zweiten Englisch-Niederländischen Seekrieg suchte, um die Herrschaft in Borkeloh (niederländisch Borculo, veraltet Heerlijkheid Borkelo) zu erobern. Mit Georg Christian von Hessen-Homburg als Oberbefehlshaber gelang ihm die militärische Eroberung der Twente, des Achterhoeks und Westerwoldes, und seine Truppen überquerten das Bourtanger Moor. Doch französische und brandenburgische Intervention verhinderte einen Erfolg, sodass es am 18. April 1666 zum Frieden von Kleve kam, in dem Galen auf Borkeloh verzichtete. 1668 kam die Grafschaft Bentheim in seinen Besitz, weil es ihm gelang, Ernst Wilhelm von Bentheim-Steinfurt zum katholischen Glauben zu bekehren. Damit fehlte ihm nur noch die Grafschaft Lingen, ebenfalls ein Protektorat der Niederländer. Im Juni 1672 unternahm er mit einer Armee von knapp 25.000 Mann im Holländischen Krieg einen zweiten Versuch, jetzt im Bündnis mit Frankreichs Ludwig XIV. und dem Kurfürsten von Köln, Maximilian Heinrich von Bayern. Nach anfänglichen Erfolgen, die Galen seiner Artillerie verdankte, forderte Ludwig XIV. Eroberungen in Gelderland, jenseits der IJssel. Von Galen richtete seine Pfeile nach Norden und eroberte Zwolle, Kampen (Niederlande) und Coevorden. Die münsterische Offensive blieb im August 1672 vor Groningen stecken, weil öst- und westlich der Stadt 45.000 ha inundiert wurde. Carl von Rabenhaupt verteidigte die Stadt und eroberte am 30. Dezember die Festung Coevorden. Als Raimondo Montecuccoli und Friedrich Wilhelm von Brandenburg sich mit der Republik der Sieben Vereinigten Provinzen verbündeten, eilte Von Galen nach Soest. Das kaiserliche Hilfskorps durfte aber nichts Entscheidendes gegen von Galen unternehmen und der damit nicht einverstandene Montecuccoli legte Anfang 1673 das Kommando nieder. Oktober 1673 versuchte von Galen nochmals, Coevorden zu erobern. 1400 seiner Soldaten ertranken wegen eines Sturmes und Dammbruchs. März 1674 versuchte er zum letzten Mal, Groningen zu erobern. Am 22. April zogen sich seine Truppen zurück. Nach dieser Niederlage bewies er dem Kaiser seine Treue, indem er ihm Truppen für den Krieg gegen Frankreich im Elsass stellte. 1675 und 1676 eroberte von Galen als Oberkommandierender eines alliierten Heeres, bestehend aus münsterschen, brandenburgischen, lüneburgischen und dänischen Truppen dann von Vechta aus in einem Feldzug die schwedischen Herzogtümer Bremen und Verden. Weiterhin kämpften seine Truppen 1677/1678 in Schonen, nahmen an der Invasion auf Rügen gegen die Schweden teil und kämpften am Rhein gegen die Franzosen. Seine Truppen bestanden aus Söldnern, die er durch Subsidien finanzierte. Kaum ein Nachbarstaat hat nicht zeitweise unter dem Einfall oder unter Einquartierung der Truppen von „Bomben-Bernd“ oder des „Kanonen-Bischofs“ gelitten. Selbst die Grafschaften Lippe, Ravensberg und Lingen mussten dies ertragen. Des Bischofs Cousin Gerhard Lothar von Büren († 1660) amtierte als Domdekan in Speyer und er wählte ihn zu seinem Testamentsvollstrecker. Wirtschafts- und Sozialpolitik Als Wirtschaftsförderer im Sinne des Merkantilismus gilt Christoph Bernhard von Galen als nicht besonders erfolgreich. Eine 1653 in Ahaus mit niederländischen Fachleuten eingerichtete Fayencemanufaktur stellte den Betrieb 1657 wieder ein. Auch eine Papiermühle in Stadtlohn wurde nur kurzzeitig betrieben. Während der Amtszeit Christoph Bernhards von Galen verarmte das Fürstbistum Münster infolge der zahlreichen Feldzüge und des Unterhalts eines starken Heeres. Allerdings erwies sich die Förderung der 1630 gegründeten Moorkolonie Papenburg durch von Galen als nachhaltiger Erfolg. Papenburg wurde so zur wirtschaftlich stärksten Gemeinde des Emslandes. Erfolgreich war von Galen auch als Gründer von Klöstern und als Landesherr, der sich darum bemühte, dass in allen Orten seines Bistums Schulen betrieben wurden, in denen auch Mädchen unterrichtet wurden. 1661 ordnete Galen an, in der früheren stadtmünsterischen Leprosenstiftung Kinderhaus ein Werk- und Arbeitshaus für bettelnde, verwahrloste Jugendliche einzurichten. Niederschlagung von Widerstand innerhalb des Bistums Als Galen 1657 von der Stadt Münster forderte, den Soldaten Verpflegung und Unterbringung zu gewährleisten, weigerte sich die Bürgerschaft, dieses kostspielige Unternehmen finanziell zu tragen. Der Einwand, dass die Stadtverteidigung schon immer Aufgabe der Bürger selbst gewesen war, überzeugte Galen nicht. Er holte sich rechtlichen Rückhalt durch den Regensburger Reichsabschied und begann, die Einquartierung seiner Truppen durchzusetzen. Der Konflikt erreichte seinen Höhepunkt, als Galen seine eigene Stadt Münster nach einer zweimonatigen Belagerung unterwarf. Die Stadt widerstand den bischöflichen Truppen lange Zeit, da die Staaten der Niederlande die Stadt unterstützten, doch als dies schließlich wegfiel, unterwarf sich Münster am 26. März 1661, nach neun Monaten Belagerung. Der Bischof schaffte die freie Ratswahl ab, ernannte zwei neue Bürgermeister und zwölf Ratsherren. Nach dem Fall Münsters überließ Galen die städtischen und seine eigenen Truppen als Dank für kaiserliche Truppenhilfe dem Kaiser für den Türkenkrieg in Ungarn. Seine Truppen kamen allerdings zu spät, um noch großen Einfluss auf den Verlauf des Krieges zu nehmen. Schon wenige Wochen nach dem Eintreffen der Truppen wurde der Frieden von Eisenburg (1664) geschlossen. Auf der Sockelinschrift des Grabes des Fürstbischofs im Dom zu Münster ist noch heute zu lesen: „Monasterium reduxit (Er hat Münster - zum Gehorsam - zurückgeführt).“ Festigung des Katholizismus im Bistum und im Reich Rekatholisierung westfälischer Adelsgeschlechter Während es unter den Adeligen in Westfalen am Anfang des 17. Jahrhunderts noch eine „konfessionelle Unschärfe“ gab und protestantische Ansichten weit verbreitet waren, addierten sich nach 1650 einzelne Konversionen von Adeligen zur katholischen Konfession zu einer Bewegung, die schließlich eine große konfessionelle Uniformität im Oberstift Münster herstellte. Maßgeblich für diesen Prozess war der Ausschluss des protestantischen Adels von den lukrativen kirchlichen Pfründen und landesherrlichen Ämtern, der bereits vor dem Amtsantritt von Galens wirksam wurde. Rettung des Klosters Corvey Nach den Verheerungen des Dreißigjährigen Krieges stand das Kloster Corvey kurz vor dem Untergang, als Bischof Christoph Bernhard von Galen 1665 dessen Administrator wurde. Er stiftete die barocke Abteikirche und belebte das Kloster durch die Wiedereinsetzung eines adligen Konvents. Nachdem sich das klösterliche Leben einigermaßen gefestigt hatte, erfolgte die Wahl des Abtes wieder aus den Reihen des Konvents. Umsetzung der Beschlüsse des Konzils von Trient Den Konzilsvätern in Trient hatte sich die Aufgabe gestellt, die Kirche derart an Haupt und Gliedern zu verbessern, dass sie sich der Kritik und den theologischen wie organisatorischen Anforderungen der reformatorischen Lehren Luthers, Zwinglis und Calvins stellen konnte. Die von diesen Reformatoren vielfach – und gewiss mit Recht – angeprangerten Missstände des kirchlichen Lebens sollten beseitigt und neue Fundamente für die Lehre, die Kirchenorganisation und die christliche Bildung der Menschen gelegt werden. Gerade auf diesem Felde hatten die jungen, sich evangelisch verstehenden Gemeinschaften Bedeutendes geleistet. Auf der katholischen Seite galt es nun, ein neues und den Erfordernissen der Zeit entsprechendes Schulwesen zu entwickeln. Die geistige Ausformung und intellektuelle Durchführung dieser Aufgabe übernahmen weitgehend die Jesuiten, deren Niederlassungen bald in allen Bistümern Europas das höhere Schulwesen prägten und auch auf die niederen Schulen ausstrahlten. In Münster allerdings ließen sich die Jesuiten erst 1588 nieder, übernahmen alsbald die alte Domschule, das Gymnasium Paulinum, und führten ihr Kolleg auch als Priesterbildungsstätte. Kein Zufall, dass Christoph Bernhard von Galen „apud patres“ – bei den Vätern – zur Schule ging und von den Jesuiten 1651 feierlich als erster Schüler ihrer Schule auf dem Bischofsthron zu Münster begrüßt wurde. Innerhalb der Tridentinischen Reform kam der Förderung des Schulwesens eine wichtige Rolle zu. Galen kannte seine Priester und ihre Schwächen wie Stärken wahrscheinlich sehr genau, bemühte er sich doch ausdrücklich auch durch seine Weihepolitik darum, die innere Struktur des Diözesanklerus zu verbessern und in der Öffentlichkeit ein neues Priesterbild zu entwickeln. Dabei war ganz klar, dass die Betreuung der Jugend den Geistlichen allein kaum übertragen werden konnte. Die Forderungen des Bischofs an seine Priester nach regelmäßiger Zelebration, die genaue Beachtung der kirchlichen Feste, Sitten und Gewohnheiten, die normale Seelsorgearbeit mit Taufen, Hochzeiten, Krankenbetreuung, Sterbebegleitung oder Beerdigungen mussten es einem aktiven Priester fast unmöglich machen, auch noch den regelmäßigen Unterricht der Schulkinder in festen zeitlichen Grenzen wahrzunehmen. Da aber neben der sonntäglichen Katechese in der Christenlehre der alltägliche Unterricht in „pietate, moribus ac litteris“ treten sollte, mussten die Schulen deutlich aktiviert werden. Somit ergab sich aus Galens Reformprogramm schlüssig die institutionalisierte, juristisch wie wirtschaftlich gesicherte Pfarr-Schule als ergänzendes Element der Seelsorge. Dass diese Schulen auch weitere Kenntnisse im Lesen, Schreiben oder gar Rechnen und sogar im Lateinischen vermitteln konnten, musste nicht notwendig schädlich sein, sondern vielmehr den Bildungsstand auf dem Lande heben, den wirtschaftlichen Interessen der Bauern und Bürger dienen und außerdem die Basis für den benötigten Nachwuchs in Klerus und Beamtenschaft deutlich verbreitern. Durch über 40 Synoden in Münster, von denen Zeugnisse überliefert sind und zu denen der gesamte Bistums-Klerus aufgeboten wurde, durch eine rege Visitationstätigkeit und regelmäßige Kontrollen bemühte sich dementsprechend Galen, das kirchliche Leben im Hochstift Münster im Geiste des Tridentinums neu zu formen. Eine Kette von Synodal-Verfügungen und weiteren Erlassen sowie das persönliche Eingreifen des Bischofs bis hinunter in die Gemeinden führte zu einem enormen Aufblühen des niederen Schulwesens bis hinein in die abgelegenen Bauerschaften des Münsterlandes. Schulreformen Die münsterländische Schulgeschichte setzt – wie in anderen Regionen des Reiches auch – mit den schon mittelalterlichen Lateinschulen am Bischofssitz Münster und in den vierzehn landtagsfähigen Städten ein. Im Jahre 1573, am Ende der seit 1571 laufenden großen Bistumsvisitation unter Fürstbischof Johann von Hoya, der dabei von Reformern wie Everwin Droste unterstützt wurde, gab es im Oberstift Münster mit seinen 130 Pfarren und Kirchspielen gerade 33 Gemeinden, die ein irgendwie geartetes Schulwesen vorweisen konnten. Bis zur Bistumsvisitation von 1613 bis 1616 stieg diese Zahl auf 55. Die nachfolgenden 20 Jahre, die noch nicht von zu heftigen Kriegsereignissen für das Münsterland geprägt waren, brachten noch einmal ein knappes Dutzend Schulgründungen hervor. Allen diesen um 1650 existierenden etwa 65 Schuleinrichtungen war aber weitgehend ihre Instabilität eigen – der Betrieb wurde immer wieder eingestellt. Mit dem Amtsantritt Christoph Bernhards wurde dies deutlich und nachhaltig anders. Den schon bestehenden Schulen gab Galen ein räumlich, finanziell und personell geordnetes Fundament und ergänzte das bestehende Netz von Schulen durch zahlreiche Neugründungen oft gegen den Widerstand lokaler Entscheidungsträger. In den 28 Jahren seiner Regierung erreichte er eine Vollversorgung des Münsterlandes mit fundierten Schulen. Die zeitlichen Eckpunkte der Gründung neuer Schulen oder geordneter Fundierung bereits existierender Einrichtungen liegen vor allem zwischen den Jahren 1655 und 1662. Keine der in der Regierungszeit Galens schon vorhandenen oder neu fundierten Pfarrschulen wurde später wieder aufgegeben. Die Grundlage des niederen Schulwesens im Münsterland wurde in seiner Regierungszeit gelegt. Als Christoph Bernhard von Galen 1675 seine Schul- und Kirchenordnung erließ, die in leicht veränderter Form auch von seinen Nachfolgern beibehalten wurde und mehr als 100 Jahre Geltung haben sollte, bildete sie fast schon den Schlusspunkt hinter dem großen Projekt. Kampf gegen den Hexenwahn In der ersten Hälfte des 17. Jahrhunderts wurde das Münsterland, verstärkt durch die Wirren des Dreißigjährigen Krieges, von einer Welle des Hexenwahns erfasst. Während von Galens Amtsvorgänger Ferdinand von Bayern Hexenprozesse als legitimes Instrument der Gegenreformation verstand, setzte sich sein Nachfolger gegen Wahrsagerei und Hexenglauben ein. Die Wasserprobe bei vermeintlichen Hexen und Zauberern ließ er 1658 verbieten. |
G;|Georg Johannes von Eppstein (bis zur Nobilitierung Johannes Georg Epstein, * 20. März 1874 in Breslau; † 28. September 1942 im Ghetto Theresienstadt) war ein deutscher Schriftsteller, Phaleristiker, Hofbeamter, Hochschulkurator und Publizist.  Herkunft und Werdegang Georg Epstein wurde als Sohn des Kaufmanns Julius Epstein und seiner Frau Jenny geb. Silbermann in Breslau geboren. Er studierte Philosophie und Literatur in Breslau und war daneben als Hilfsredakteur, Feuilletonist und Theaterkritiker für Zeitungen tätig. Er promovierte 1899 zum Dr. phil. und veröffentlichte diverse literarische Skizzen, Novellen und Lyrikbände. Um die Jahrhundertwende wohnte er in Berlin-Mitte. 1901 ließ sich der Autor, der jüdischer Herkunft war, in Berlin-Kreuzberg christlich taufen. Als Publizist beschäftigte er sich mit staatsrechtlichen und historischen Themen, wobei er hauptsächlich Pressestimmen und Archivquellen kompilierte, edierte und kommentierte. 1909 veröffentlichte er an der Schlesischen Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität zu Breslau eine juristische Dissertation zum Kündigungsrecht der Beamten. Epstein war Mitherausgeber des von Paul von Roëll (1854–1917), der dem Centralverband deutscher Industrieller nahestand und mit dem er auch anderweitig publizierte, im Jahr 1901 gegründeten halboffiziösen Organs Neue politische Correspondenz, in dem häufig amtliche Verlautbarungen und Stellungnahmen erschienen, sodass er sich regelmäßig in Berliner Ministerien bewegte. Über von Roëll, der sich auch als Adelsforscher und Ordenskundler betätigte und 1902–1903 Fürstlich Lippischer Kammerherr war, kam Epstein mit den Fragen des lippischen Erbfolgestreits in Berührung und begann, sich mit den Rechtsangelegenheiten des damaligen Regenten Leopold zur Lippe aus der Linie Lippe-Biesterfeld zu befassen. Nach dessen Thronbesteigung wurde Georg Epstein als Rechts- und Finanzberater des Fürstenhauses herangezogen und trat Anfang 1912 als Leiter des Zivilkabinetts des Fürsten Leopold IV. zur Lippe in dessen Dienste. Mit seiner Familie lebte er bis dahin in Berlin-Wilmersdorf, ab 1912 als lippischer Untertan in Detmold, wo ihm als Kabinettsrat eine Dienstwohnung zur Verfügung stand. Aus seiner Ehe mit Herta Reymann (1876–1938) stammte die 1909 geborene Tochter Ingeborg († 1923). Ordensfachmann und Hofbeamter Als Schriftleiter des Deutschen Ordens-Almanachs gab er in den Jahren 1904 bis 1908 zusammen mit v. Roëll und anderen Ordenskundlern ein umfangreiches, halboffizielles Sammelwerk heraus, das alle deutschen Träger in- und ausländischer Orden verzeichnen sollte, die keinem regierenden oder depossedierten Fürstenhaus angehörten. Er selbst wurde von Fürst Leopold IV. am 30. Januar 1912 mit dem lippischen Leopold-Orden ausgezeichnet, im Jahre 1915 geadelt und 1918 zum Freiherrn erhoben und nannte sich fortan von Eppstein. Im Ersten Weltkrieg war er nach anfänglicher Verwendung in Polen ab Sommer 1915 für einige Zeit bei übergeordneten Stäben in der Umgebung des in Belgien und Frankreich eingesetzten Kontingentverbands des Fürstentums Lippe tätig und wurde zeitweise als Ordonnanzoffizier im Stab des Generals Hermann von François verwendet. In dieser Funktion lernte er auch den deutschen Kronprinzen Wilhelm kennen, der damals die 5. Armee und ab November 1916 die Heeresgruppe Deutscher Kronprinz befehligte, zu der auch das lippische Kontingent gehörte. Eppstein freundete sich mit dessen (laut späteren antisemitischen Gerüchten angeblich jüdischstämmigen) Adjutanten Louis Müldner von Mülnheim an. 1917 wurde er zum Wirklichen Geheimen Rat mit dem Titel „Excellenz“ ernannt und begleitete den Fürsten bei Frontbesuchen und auf offiziellen Reisen, unter anderem bei seinem Staatsbesuch in München vom 11. bis 13. Dezember 1917. An der vom Fürsten Ende 1916 auf Eppsteins Initiative errichteten und in den folgenden Jahren aufgebauten Fürst Leopold-Akademie für Verwaltungswissenschaften in Detmold, an der kriegsversehrte Offiziere zu Kommunalbeamten umgeschult werden sollten, wirkte Georg von Eppstein als Kurator mit dem Titel „Professor“. Die Akademie, die bis 1924 bestand, ehrte ihn für sein Engagement mit der Ehrendoktorwürde. Seine Erlebnisse während der Novemberrevolution in Detmold, wo er als einer der engsten Berater des Fürsten mit örtlichen und zugereisten Revolutionären verhandelte, schildert er in seiner von autobiographischen Anekdoten durchsetzten Kronprinzenbiographie bruchstückhaft selbst. Schon seit Oktober 1918 führte er mit dem fortschrittlichen Reichstagsabgeordneten Adolf Neumann-Hofer, der dann in den Tagen des Detmolder Umsturzes eine wichtige Rolle als Berater und Vermittler spielte, einen Briefwechsel, um die Möglichkeiten zum Erhalt der Monarchie in Lippe auszuloten. Eppstein behandelt die Vorgänge um das Ende der Monarchie in Lippe später noch einmal ausführlich in seinem niederländischen Buch über Prins Bernhard (1936). Titelvergaben in letzter Minute Als Chef des Zivilkabinetts fielen auch Ordensverleihungen, Titelvergaben und Adelserhebungen in seine Zuständigkeit, die während des Kaiserreichs eine nicht unbedeutende Einnahmequelle vieler deutscher Kleinstfürstentümer darstellten. Eppsteins Kenntnisse im Ordens- und Titelwesen waren also nicht nur persönliche Liebhaberei, sondern qualifizierten ihn entscheidend für seine Stellung bei Hofe. Ebenso wie Eppstein jüdischer Herkunft und als enger Berater für ein Fürstenhaus tätig war auch Kurt Kleefeld, ein Schwager von Gustav Stresemann, der vom Fürsten zur Lippe noch am 12. November 1918, dem Tag seiner Abdankung, als letzte in Deutschland überhaupt geadelte Person nobilitiert wurde. Gleichzeitig verlieh der Fürst dem mit Eppstein befreundeten Zeitungsverleger und Inhaber der Meyerschen Hofbuchhandlung und Hofbuchdruckerei in Detmold, Max Staercke, der das Haus Biesterfeld im Thronfolgestreit unterstützt hatte (und der sich trotz seiner nationalliberalen Gesinnung und gegen völkische Widerstände in Detmold in den 1920er Jahren als konsequenter Gegner des Antisemitismus profilierte) den Titel Hofrat und Eppstein selbst den Freiherrntitel. Diese Ordens- und Titelverleihungen in letzter Minute, in die Eppstein als Zivilkabinettschef offenkundig involviert war, führten am Ort zur Entstehung antisemitischer Legenden über den „Hofjuden“, der das Fürstenhaus durch „Titelschacher“ saniert habe, nachdem er sich dem Fürsten als „Jude aus den preußischen Ostprovinzen“ (Eppstein stammte aus Breslau) „angedient“ und „unentbehrlich gemacht“ habe. Diese gehässigen und von antijüdischen Klischees getragenen Darstellungen drangen – unterstützt durch Eppstein unfreundlich gesinnte Zeitzeugen – auch in seriöse Fachliteratur ein. Einige Zeit nach der Abdankung des Fürsten siedelte Georg Freiherr von Eppstein nach Berlin-Lichterfelde um und erwarb 1921 eine Villa in der Potsdamer Straße 32, die er aus Verehrung für seine Frau „Haus Herta“ nannte. Die Anerkennung seines Adelstitels (den er als lippischer Untertan unangefochten in ganz Deutschland führen durfte, bei einer Rückkehr in die preußische Staatsangehörigkeit ohne adelsrechtliche Anerkennung in Preußen aber verloren hätte) hatte er gleich nach der Nobilitierung 1915 beim preußischen Heroldsamt beantragt. Obwohl das Amt sie nach Kräften zu verhindern suchte und noch 1917 Nachforschungen über seinen Vater anstellte, gelang es ihm kurioserweise gerade infolge der Abschaffung des Adels in der Weimarer Republik, seinen adligen Namen und die Bezeichnung „Freiherr“ trotz Rückkehr nach Berlin bis zu seinem Lebensende zu behalten, denn das Heroldsamt hörte mit dem Kaiserreich auf zu bestehen und die Titel hatten sich von Rechts wegen in Namensbestandteile verwandelt. Anders als in der älteren Literatur behauptet, wurde ihm der Adelsname auch von den Nationalsozialisten nie aberkannt. Monarchist und Objekt antijüdischer Anfeindungen In den 1920er Jahren veröffentlichte er mehrere historische und zeitgeschichtliche Bücher, für die er Literatur und Akten studierte und Äußerungen von Zeitzeugen sammelte und zusammenstellte. Besonderes Interesse und Verehrung brachte er dem früheren Reichskanzler Otto von Bismarck und dem ehemaligen deutschen Kronprinzen Wilhelm von Hohenzollern entgegen, den er in seiner 1926 veröffentlichten Biographie vehement gegen Kritiker in Schutz nahm. Eppsteins Werk enthält eigene Erinnerungen, reproduziert aber hauptsächlich fremde Schilderungen und Einschätzungen, die er den zu Beginn der zwanziger Jahre in großer Zahl publizierten Rechtfertigungsschriften und Erinnerungsbüchern vormaliger Militärs, Politiker und Höflinge entnahm. Dem in diesem Schrifttum enthaltenen Antisemitismus, der gerade in jenen rechtsnationalen Kreisen besonders schrill artikuliert wurde, denen er in seinen politischen Anschauungen nahestand, bemühte sich Eppstein mit Sachargumenten entgegenzutreten, ohne jedoch dessen weit reichende Bedeutung auch für sein persönliches Schicksal zu erkennen. Seiner monarchistischen Überzeugung folgend stand er der Weimarer Republik reserviert gegenüber und betrachtete eine Restauration der bis 1918 regierenden Adelshäuser als grundsätzlich wünschenswertes politisches Szenario. Im Herbst 1923, unmittelbar im Vorfeld der durch Geheimdiplomatie zwischen der Reichskanzlei unter Gustav Stresemann und den Kontaktleuten des Hofes arrangierten Rückkehr des Kronprinzen nach Deutschland, begleitete Eppstein den kronprinzlichen Adjutanten Müldner von Mülnheim bei einem seiner Besuche auf Wieringen, dem holländischen Exil Wilhelms, und befragte den Kronprinzen für sein Buchprojekt. Auch der Kontakt zum Haus Lippe riss zunächst noch nicht ab; so empfing Eppstein 1923 oder 1924 in seinem Berliner Haus noch einen Besuch des Erbprinzen Ernst Leopold. Da sich die jüngere Generation der Fürstenfamilie aber bald dem Nationalsozialismus verschrieb (Ernst Leopold trat 1928 als erster Erbprinz eines ehemals regierenden deutschen Adelshauses der NSDAP bei), wurde den Prinzen die Verbindung mit dem in der Detmolder Öffentlichkeit angefeindeten und als „Hofjude“ titulierten Eppstein zunehmend unangenehm. Eppstein wurde sowohl in der nationalsozialistischen Propaganda als auch in der linken Presse nachgesagt, er habe den Fürsten kurz vor dem Ende seiner Herrschaft durch lukrative Verkäufe von Titeln und Orden finanziell saniert, was gut in das judenfeindliche Zerrbild vom ‚wendigen‘ Geschäftemacher passte und zugleich den Adel desavouierte. Zum Eklat kam es anlässlich der Hochzeit der Fürstentochter Karoline (genannt Prinzessin Lilli) im Jahre 1932, als Fürst Leopold den bereits zum Fest geladenen Freiherrn von Eppstein auf Druck seiner Kinder und Familienangehörigen wieder auslud. Der Hof fürchtete auch angesichts der geplanten Beteiligung von SA-Musikzügen und NS-Parteivertretern an den Hochzeitsfeierlichkeiten um den Ruf der Familie im rechten Milieu. Unterstützung aus adligen Kreisen erhielt Georg von Eppstein in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus kaum und war zunehmend auf sich allein gestellt. Anfang der 30er Jahre befand sich Eppstein zudem in finanziellen Schwierigkeiten und musste im Frühjahr 1932 seine Lebensversicherung an einen jüdischen Rechtsanwalt verpfänden, der 1933 in die Schweiz emigrierte. Einen Kredit erhielt er offenbar auch von einer Stiftung der evangelischen Landeskirche in Potsdam, die nach seiner Deportation Hypothekenzinsen beim Oberfinanzpräsidenten verlangte. Bereits im Mai 1933 war der mit Eppstein seit dem Weltkrieg befreundete und ebenfalls in dem Lichterfelder Villenviertel wohnhafte ehemalige preußische General und militärgeschichtliche Buchautor Hermann von François, der zusammen mit Eppstein die zweibändige Biographie des ehemaligen Kronprinzen veröffentlicht hatte, gestorben. Bucherfolg in den Niederlanden Einen gewissen Nutzen aus seinen früheren Beziehungen zum lippischen Fürstenhaus konnte Georg von Eppstein noch einmal ziehen, als es ihm 1936 im Vorfeld der Heirat Prinz Bernhard zur Lippe-Biesterfelds mit der Thronfolgerin der Niederlande und zukünftigen Königin Juliana gelang, für den niederländischen Markt ein Buch in niederländischer Sprache über das Adelshaus zu veröffentlichen, dem der künftige niederländische Prinzgemahl (ein Neffe Fürst Leopolds zur Lippe) angehörte. Das Buch, das etwa einen Monat vor der Hochzeit Anfang Dezember 1936 erschien (knapp drei Monate nach Bekanntgabe der Verlobung), wurde in der niederländischen Presse breit angekündigt und besprochen; es galt als halboffiziöse Biographie des neuen Mitglieds des Königshauses und erlebte binnen kürzester Frist drei Auflagen. Es war mit persönlichen Geleitworten Fürst Leopolds, Prinz Bernhards und von dessen Mutter Armgard versehen, in denen der Freiherr von Eppstein als treuer Freund und bester Kenner der Geschichte des Hauses Lippe gewürdigt wird, und enthielt neben den historischen Darstellungen und zahlreichen Bildern auch mehrere Gedichte Eppsteins. Gemeinsam mit seinem Mitautor Hofrat Max Staercke und dem Utrechter Verleger Albert W. Bruna (1902–1996) wurde „Prof. von Eppstein“, wie er sich nannte, am 11. November 1936 in Het Loo offiziell als Biograph des fürstlichen Verlobten vom königlichen Hofmarschall begrüßt und vom Adjutanten der niederländischen Königin Wilhelmina und Prinz Bernhard persönlich empfangen und gab vier Tage später dem niederländischen Sender Philips Omroep Holland-Indië (PHOHI) ein Radiointerview, in dem er den Niederländern die Vorzüge der Persönlichkeit des künftigen Gemahls ihrer Kronprinzessin ans Herz legte. Er sei, sagte Eppstein, stark von seinem Vater Bernhard geprägt, welcher ihn gelehrt habe: „Verlasse nie den Weg zu Gott, und den der Menschenliebe, sei treu gegen jedermann und achte auch den Geringsten, mit dem du zusammenkommst, dann wird auch dir Treue geschenkt werden.“ Wenn sich der Prinz an die Mahnung seines Vaters halte, so Eppstein, sei dem niederländischen Volk mit ihm eine glückliche Zukunft beschieden. Verfolgung und Deportation Längerfristig helfen konnte ihm diese Veröffentlichung jedoch nicht; vielmehr nahmen die Nationalsozialisten sie zum Anlass, Eppstein im Februar 1937 aus der Reichskulturkammer auszuschließen und jede weitere Publikation zu untersagen. Als Vorwand, der die angebliche „Unzuverlässigkeit“ des Autors zeigen sollte, diente niederländischen Presseberichten zufolge der Vorwurf, Eppstein habe in der Biographie unter anderem verschwiegen, dass Prinz Bernhard Mitglied der Reiter-SS war. Tatsächlich hatte er diese (in der niederländischen Öffentlichkeit im Wesentlichen bekannten) Tatsachen in der Biographie nicht erwähnt, nach Darstellung in der niederländischen Linkspresse geschah das allerdings auf ausdrückliche Bitte des niederländischen Königshauses. In Wahrheit entsprach der Ausschluss der ab 1935 und speziell Ende 1936 auf Weisung Goebbels’ verschärften Gangart der Kammer gegen verbliebene „nichtarische“ Kulturschaffende. Eine Auswanderung in die Niederlande fasste Eppstein anscheinend nicht ins Auge. In der geräumigen Villa in Berlin-Lichterfelde lebte das seit dem Tod ihrer Tochter kinderlose Ehepaar Eppstein zusammen mit mehrfach wechselnden Mitbewohnern und Untermietern. Anfang August 1938 starb Eppsteins nichtjüdische Frau Herta und wurde in Berlin in dem Grab beigesetzt, in dem bereits ihre 1923 knapp vierzehnjährig verstorbene gemeinsame Tochter beerdigt lag. Damit verlor Eppstein auch die begrenzten Schutzmöglichkeiten durch eine „Mischehe“ mit einem „deutschblütigen“ Partner. Nach den Novemberpogromen 1938 verschärften sich die staatlichen Repressalien und die Ausplünderung der Juden, wie zum Beispiel durch die sukzessive willkürlich erhöhte Judenvermögensabgabe oder die Verordnung über den Einsatz des jüdischen Vermögens. Da Juden keine Waffen besitzen durften, musste Georg von Eppstein seinen Ehrensäbel abliefern, worüber er sich mit Nachbarn beriet. Mit der Tochter eines ebenfalls jüdischstämmigen Nachbarn, der im November 1938 kurzzeitig verhaftet wurde und anschließend emigrieren konnte, baute Eppstein in den letzten Jahren seines Lebens ein vaterersatzähnliches freundschaftliches Verhältnis auf. In der Nachbarschaft war er nach der Erinnerung von Zeitzeugen beliebt, auf seine Deportation reagierten Nachbarn und Freunde nach Aussage eines in der Nachbarschaft lebenden Arztes „entsetzt“. Vorsorglich hatte er sein Haus bereits 1937 testamentarisch befreundeten nichtjüdischen Untermietern vermacht; allerdings wurde das noch nicht vollzogene Testament aufgrund einer „Vermögens-Einziehungsverfügung vor der Abschiebung“ hinfällig und der Grundbesitz fiel an das Deutsche Reich. Am 26. Juni 1942 wurde Georg von Eppstein verhaftet und am 2. Juli 1942 mit dem 13. Alterstransport nach Theresienstadt deportiert, wo er Ende September 1942 (ausweislich des Totenscheins an einer Darminfektion) starb. Zu seiner Erinnerung wurde ein Stolperstein bei seinem früheren Haus Potsdamer Straße 32 in Berlin-Lichterfelde verlegt. Eine Lebensgeschichte Georg von Eppsteins ist ein Forschungsdesiderat. |
G;|Hermann Hakel (* 12. August 1911 in Wien; † 24. Dezember 1987 ebenda) war ein österreichischer Lyriker, Erzähler, Redakteur, Herausgeber und Übersetzer.  „Ich wurde im August des Jahres 5671 jüdischer und 1911 christlicher Zeitrechnung geboren. Ich bin Jude und unter Christen aufgewachsen; und zwar im römisch-katholischen Wien. Meine Kindheit fällt mit dem sogenannten Ersten Weltkrieg zusammen und ist eng mit der Erinnerung an diesen verknüpft. Ich war gerade drei Jahre alt, als mein Vater, ein schlichter Malermeister, als einfacher Soldat zu den Waffen gerufen wurde. Ich erinnere mich deshalb so genau, weil ich gleichzeitig krank wurde: ich bekam Gelenksentzündung und mußte operiert werden. […] Während mein Vater [Benjamin Hakel, 1886 Czernowitz – 1950 Tel Aviv] irgendwo an der Front war, wurde mein jüngerer Bruder geboren [Arnold Hakel, 1914 Wien – 1988 Buenos Aires; Architekt], bekam bald darauf Diphtherie und ich, durch ihn angesteckt, erblindete fast für ein Jahr. Das war 1915. […] Im Sommer 1916, in ein jüdisches Kinderheim gebracht, stürzte ich so unglücklich, daß die alte Gelenksentzündung rezidiv wurde und ich drei Jahre lang von einer Operation zur anderen hinsiechte. [… Von seiner Großmutter erhielt er sein zweites Buch,] das mich auf allen Wanderungen, durch alle Länder, Städte und Gefängnisse begleitet hat: Es ist ein dickes, über tausend Seiten starkes Buch und heißt: Altes und Neues Testament, übersetzt von Martin Luther. Ich war ein sehr schlechter Schüler und wurde Hupferl gerufen, weil ich hinkte. […] Ich wollte nichts lernen und ging Monate lang statt zur Schule im Winter in Museen und Bibliotheken, […]“ Nach seiner Jugend- und Schulzeit auf der „Mazzesinsel“ besuchte Hakel die Kunstgewerbeschule in Wien und hielt sich Anfang der 1930er-Jahre längere Zeit bei Verwandten in der Bukowina auf, und zwar in Czernowitz und in Sereth. Dort lernte er das Jiddische und den Chassidismus kennen. Im Jahr 1931 begann er mit seinen Tagebuchaufzeichnungen, die er – mit nur wenigen Unterbrechungen – bis 1986 fortführte. Heute bilden sie den wichtigsten und ergiebigsten Teil seines Nachlasses und wurden nach seinem Tod teilweise als Bücher veröffentlicht: Dürre Äste Welkes Gras (1991), Der unheilbare Wahn (1993) und Zu Fuß durchs Rote Meer (1995). Ab 1934 lebte er als freier Schriftsteller in Wien und trat dem Bund junger österreichischer Autoren mit ihrem Stammtisch im Café Dobner bei. 1935 bis 1938 arbeitete er als Lektor im Wiener Verlag Anzengruber, wo 1936 sein erstes Werk veröffentlicht wurde: die Lyriksammlung Ein Kunstkalender in Gedichten. Daneben schrieb er auch für die linkssozialistische Untergrundzeitschrift „Rote Vorhut“. Mit seinen Schriftstellerkollegen Jean Améry, Friedrich Bergammer, Hans Friedrich Enk, Rudolf Felmayer, Johann Gunert, Ernst Lissauer, Paula von Preradović, Theodor Sapper und anderen stand er in freundschaftlicher Verbindung. Der „Anschluss“ Österreichs bedeutete für Hakel und alle Juden Österreichs eine Zäsur. Die Stammtische im Café Dobner und Zentral wurden aufgelöst. „Wien ist voller Hakenkreuze. Die Wiener sind berauscht von Siegesparaden und Heil-Gebrüll, vom Bier- und Weinkonsum. […] Die Juden fühlen sich schon im Ghetto. […] Jetzt herrschen die ‚arischen’ Massen, Hysteriker und hysterisch gewordene Arbeitslose. […] In der Hauptallee, auf der Straße, ist alle hundert Schritte in meterhohen Buchstaben zu lesen: ‚Juda verrecke!’ Ich bin Jude. Ich soll also verrecken. Das tägliche Gratis-Gaudium des Pöbels: Juden müssen Straßen reiben, Frosch-Hüpfen und Hundedreck fressen. Wir sind zu dritt und reden über Verhaftungen und Ausreisemöglichkeiten. Jeder Jude trägt die Tragödie im Gesicht. Erregte Gespräche. Man muß das Fenster schließen. Sooft es läutet, erschrickt man. Die Atmosphäre ist voller Dumpfheit und Angst. Ein Unbekannter packt mich an den Haaren und versetzt mir mit der anderen Hand einen Boxhieb ins linke Auge. Lautlos ertrage ich den Faustschlag. Diese erbärmliche Angst! Dieses Würgen in der Kehle! […] Seit heute früh werden jüdische Männer wahllos aus den Häusern geholt. Ein Telefonanruf nach dem anderen alarmiert mich und berichtet von schrecklichen Dingen. […] Jeder Stiefelschritt im Hof erschreckt mich. Wieviele solcher Pogromtage werde ich durchhalten? Ein sinnloses Martyrium.“ Nachdem er im Juni 1939 von den Nazis halb tot geprügelt worden war, gelang ihm am 24. Juni noch die Flucht nach Italien, wo er sich zunächst in Rijeka und Triest aufhielt, bevor er nach Mailand reiste. Mit Unterstützung eines jüdischen Hilfskomitees konnte er eine Zeit lang überleben, bis er 1940 verhaftet wurde. Bis 1943 war er dann in verschiedenen Lagern in Süditalien interniert: in Civitella in Val di Chiana bei Arezzo, in Oliveto Citra bei Eboli, in Alberobello, in Tarsia bei Cosenza und schließlich als ein „internato libero“ (freier Internierter) in Rotonda in der Basilicata. Während dieser Zeit lernte er den russischen Schriftsteller Nicolaus Ozupe kennen. Seine damals verfassten Texte hatte er später vernichtet, mit anderen Lagerinsassen veranstaltete er Laienspiele und Kabarettabende. „Warum sie uns Juden einsperren mußten, war ihnen nie klar. […] Wir haben gehungert und gefroren, aber nie hat uns ein Italiener beschimpft oder gar geschlagen. […] Man konnte wunderbar mit ihnen leben, was man mit Deutschen und Österreichern nicht kann.“ „Spät abends, im großen Schlafsaal, spielte der Czernowitzer Mediziner B. auf der Ziehharmonika russische Volkslieder. […] Links neben mir sitzt der bucklige Pole und fanatische Kommunist W., ein ehemaliger Spanienkämpfer, und rechts der einarmige blonde J. aus Danzig, ein begeisterter Zionist.“ Als er nach seiner Befreiung durch die Alliierten aus amerikanischen Zeitung von den Vorgängen in den Konzentrationslagern des „Dritten Reiches“ erfuhr, erlitt er einen Herzanfall und war ein halbes Jahr im Spital. 1944 traf er in Ancona mit Franz Theodor Csokor und Alexander von Sacher-Masoch zusammen und war dann Mitglied der „Freien Österreichischen Bewegung“ und Mitarbeiter des britischen Palästina-Amtes in Bari. Im März 1945 fuhr Hakel zu seinen Eltern nach Palästina. „Die jüdischen Siedlungen, an denen wir vorbeikommen, sind mit Gittern umgrenzt, von dichtem Grün umwachsen und parzelliert. Jetzt tauchen entlang der Straße die englischen Zwingburgen auf. Auf den Ecktürmen sind Lautsprecher, Scheinwerfer und Maschinengewehre montiert. Dazwischen Herden von schwarzen Rindern und Ziegen. Ein Vers aus dem ‚Hohelied’ fällt mir ein: ‚… sie sind wie schwarze Locken im blendenden Gelb des Sandes …’“ 1947 verließ Hakel das Land wieder und kehrte nach einem Aufenthalt in Rom im Herbst nach Wien zurück. „Allmählich bekommen ich den Eindruck, daß den Leuten hier viel Ärgers passiert ist als uns heimkehrenden Juden. Mein Problem ist die Heimatlosigkeit. In Wien habe ich meine Kindheit und Jugend verbracht, aber jetzt muß ich erkennen, daß ich hier nicht mehr zu Hause bin. In Palästina fand ich mich nicht zu recht, dort war nur die Mutter mein Daheim. […] Und dann die Erwachsenen, die immer hier zu Hause gewesen sind, – erst jetzt spüre ich, was sie uns angetan haben. Die Jahre der Verfolgung und Vernichtung klaffen zwischen uns. […] Ich bin als Heimatloser heimgekehrt.“ Von 1948 bis 1950 war er Vorstandsmitglied und Lektor des Österreichischen P.E.N. Clubs und gründete dort eine Aktion zur Förderung junger Autoren (Aktion „Der P.E.N. stellt vor“). 1948 bis 1951 und 1979 bis 1986 gab er die Zeitschrift Lynkeus heraus, um an „Vergessenes zu erinnern, Fernes anzunähern, Fremdes bekannt zu machen und junge Autoren kritisch zu sichten und zu veröffentlichen“. „Hakel sammelte einen Kreis um sich, zum Teil aus Plan-Autoren. 1948/49 gab Hakel die Zeitschrift ‚Lynkeus’ heraus, mit Ausländern, Emigranten und wieder: jungen Plan-Hakel-Autoren. Hier starteten unter anderem Jeannie Ebner und Hertha Kräftner. 1949/50 verlief sich der Hakel-Kreis dann, teilweise ging er zu dem zweiten bedeutenden Jugendförderer Hans Weigel über, der jetzt im berühmten Café Raimund seine Haupttätigkeit entfaltete. […Ein] ‚Zweiter Hakelkreis’ bestand vermutlich von 1951 bis 1958, einheitliches Phänomen mit wechselnder Besetzung. […] jetzt jedenfalls waren die Hakel-Seancen eine Art Gehirnwäsche, an deren Ende man sich klein und schädlich vorkam, das Schreiben aufgab oder bereit war, irgendeinen großen Bruder zu lieben. Dieser große Bruder war freilich nicht Stalin, sondern eine Projektion Hakels gegen die Milchstraße, mit Zügen Moses’, Dantes, Goethes, voll Kafkascher Richterstrenge für die schwerbegreifliche Schuld des Ichseins und Modischseins strafend.“ Hakel wurde damit zum Mentor und Förderer junger Schriftsteller wie Ingeborg Bachmann, Gerhard Fritsch und Marlen Haushofer, die hier ihre Texte erstmals veröffentlichen konnten. Andere Mitarbeiter waren u. a. Christine Busta, Bertrand A. Egger, Reinhard Federmann, Ernst Fischer, Erich Fried, Johann Gunert, Josef Kalmer, Alexander Lernet-Holenia, Friederike Mayröcker und Wilhelm Szabo. Er hatte für sie getan, „was er konnte, hatte sie bewirtet, ihnen Geld geliehen oder geschenkt, Posten vermittelt, ihre Arbeiten gedruckt, etc. In dieser Hinsicht war er von außergewöhnlicher Fürsorge.“ Besonders setzte sich Hakel auch für Gerhard Amanshauser ein, der ihn einmal so beschrieb: „Hakel war ungewöhnlich klein und bewegte sich hinkend vorwärts. Der eine Fuß war infolge eines frühen Unfalls und einer mißglückten Operation etwa 10 cm kürzer als der andere, was durch einen Schuh mit besonders hohem Absatz ausgeglichen wurde. Sein Gesicht wirkte stark jüdisch; der Mund war angenehm, die Nase profan und ohne Feinheit, ein Auge schön, voll tiefen Ausdrucks, das andere durch eine Krankheit getrübt. Die Stirne hatte eine außergewöhnlich schöne Wölbung. Die Haut jedoch wirkte blaß und kränklich. Die körperlichen Mängel dieses Mannes waren so auffallend, daß es nur schwer zu ermessen ist, wie sehr er darunter litt und in welchem Ausmaß – ein Umstand, den er selbst manchmal betonte – sein rebellisches Denken davon ausging. Die Nachteile seiner körperlichen Erscheinung konnte man vollständig vergessen, wenn er zu sprechen begann. […] Seine Stimme war laut, deutlich vom Wiener Dialekt gefärbt, kräftig akzentuiert, derb und manchmal ordinär im Ausdruck. Ungemein originell waren die Formulierungen. Er beherrschte fast jedes Gespräch und war, durch eine verblüffende Gegenwart des Geistes, niemals um eine Antwort verlegen. Diese Gabe nützte er tyrannisch aus und ließ die anderen kaum zu Wort kommen.“ Während seiner Ehe (1949–1958) mit Erika Danneberg begann die Freundschaft mit Berthold Viertel. Seine Frau war Viertels Sekretärin; nach dessen Tod 1953 arbeiteten beide gemeinsam den Nachlass auf. Das Scheitern der Ehe führte bei beiden zu einer Unterbrechung ihrer literarischen Arbeiten. 1958/59 war er Cheflektor des Sefer-Verlages in Wien und arbeitete in der Folgezeit als Vortragender an Volkshochschulen in Wien (Urania) und München. Im Rahmen dieses „Autorenstudio“ mit dem Untertitel „Wie und was man schreibt“ hielt Hakel von 1953 bis 1964 mit einigen Unterbrechungen wöchentlich eine Abendvorlesung in der Urania. „Er war immer neugierig auf junge Leute, wollte wissen, was sie in diesem Jahrzehnt nach Hitler dachten und zu sagen hatten. Schon bei meinem ersten Besuch sprach er ausführlich von seiner Überzeugung, daß Schreiben, bis zu einem gewissen Grad, erlernbar sei. Er ging dabei von der sinnlichen Wahrnehmung aus, man müsse das, was man niederschreibe, ‚sehen, hören, riechen oder schmecken’, da es nur in diesem Fall zu der gewünschten Intensität des Ausdrucks kommen könne. Er war der Meinung, daß ein gut geschriebener Satz für jeden verständlich sein müsse. [… Einmal hielt er einen Vortrag,] in dessen Verlauf Hakel in der ihm eigenen Art Hesse und Weinheber kritisierte. Damit erregte er den Unwillen eines jungen Zuhörers, der schließlich aufsprang und mit den Worten: ‚Sie … Sie Goethe aus der Novaragassen!’ den Saal verließ. […] Zu Hakels 70. Geburtstag […] erzählte er [d.i. Roman Rocek] mir, daß er […] damals in der Urania diese Verbindung von Goethe und Novaragasse hergestellt hatte. [… Er gab mir Bücher mit und] jeder Band wurde seinerseits von ‚einleitenden Worten’ begleitet, die oft Stunden in Anspruch nahmen, da sie nicht nur aus einer ausführlichen Biographie des jeweiligen Autors bestanden, sondern sich auch mit den diffizilsten Stilfragen auseinandersetzten. Erträglich waren diese monströsen Monologe nur infolge der Brillanz, mit der sie vorgetragen wurden, so daß es immer ein Vergnügen war, zuzuhören“. „Meist erzählte und philosophierte Hakel vor uns hin über Gott und die Welt, Goethe und Schiller, Proust und Joyce, Montaigne und Valéry, Rilke, aber auch über den Dämon in Mörike, die Groteske bei Emily Dickinson, die Blasorchesterhaftigkeit bei Richard Wagner (seine einzige musikalische Allergie), die relative ‚Humanität’ im italienischen Juden-KZ und so weiter – und alles plastisch, pointiert, leicht belustigt oder abgeklärt, und immer bar jeder Aggression oder jedes Ressentiments. Seine 12 Bücher der Weltliteratur, die er uns unbedingt nahe legte: Dante: Divina Comedia, Boccacchio: [sic!] Dekamerone, Cervantes: Don Quixote, Montaigne: Essais, Pascal: Pensées, Swift: Gullivers Reisen, Goethe: Faust, Tolstoi: Krieg und Frieden, Flaubert: Bouvard und Pécuchet, Stendhal Rot und Schwarz, Gogol: Der Mantel, Andersen: Märchen“. 1959 bekam er für ein Jahr einen Platz am Österreichischen Kulturinstitut in Rom. Als Kulturredakteur gab er zahlreiche Anthologien von Viennensia und Judaica heraus und schrieb Beiträge für die Zeitschriften „Die Schau“, „Das Jüdische Echo“ und „Illustrierte Neue Welt“. 1961 bis 1964 war Hakel Mitarbeiter des Forum-Verlages, für den er zahlreiche Sammelbände als Herausgeber veröffentlichte. Nach dem Tod seiner Mutter Charlotte (geb. Springer, 1887 Wien – 1978 Tel Aviv) zog er sich „immer deutlicher aus der Öffentlichkeit zurück. Er schrieb nichts Neues mehr, arbeitete aber täglich an seinen Gedichten: An Veröffentlichungen war er nicht mehr interessiert. Der moderne Kulturbetrieb, wie er ihn vor sich sah, war ihm ekelhaft. Für ihn befand sich alles in Auflösung. Dazu kam, daß sein Verhältnis zu den Künstlern, und hier besonders zu den Literaten, immer ein sehr zwiespältiges gewesen war; […] er hat oft davon gesprochen, wie schwer es ihm schon immer gefallen sei, die Eitelkeit, den Egoismus und den Größenwahn der kleinen und großen Dichter auszuhalten“. 1980 wurde er mit der Ehrenmedaille der Bundeshauptstadt Wien in Silber geehrt. „Was ich jetzt noch empfinde, ist mein Alter, meine Krankheit und das Wissen um die bedrohliche Zukunft der Welt, die keine wie immer geartete Aussicht auf Rettung und Überleben zeigt. Ich denke dabei nicht an mich, sondern, – womit ich zutiefst verbunden bin, – an meine Familie und mein Volk.“ (Tagebuchnotiz 1983) Nach Hakels Tod wurde 1988 u. a. von Emmerich Kolovic, seinem langjährigen Vertrauten, die Hermann Hakel Gesellschaft gegründet, die seinen umfangreichen Nachlass ordnete, betreute, den Lynkeus Verlag zur Edition von Hakels Werken gründete und im Februar 2004 dem Österreichischen Literaturarchiv der Österreichischen Nationalbibliothek übergab. |
G;|Lauren Bacall [ˌlɔrən bəˈkɔːl] (* 16. September 1924 in New York City, New York als Betty Joan Perske; † 12. August 2014 ebenda) war eine US-amerikanische Schauspielerin. Lauren Bacall zählte zu den Leinwandlegenden der „goldenen Ära“ Hollywoods und spielte während ihrer 68 Jahre lang dauernden Filmkarriere an der Seite von Leinwandgrößen wie ihrem Ehemann Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne, Rock Hudson, Gary Cooper, Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis oder Kirk Douglas. Zu ihren berühmtesten Filmen gehören ihr Leinwanddebüt Haben und Nichthaben (1944), die Thriller Tote schlafen fest (1946) und Gangster in Key Largo (1948), die Liebeskomödie Wie angelt man sich einen Millionär? (1953) sowie der Film Liebe hat zwei Gesichter (1996), für den sie den Golden Globe Award und eine Oscar-Nominierung erhielt. In den 1970er Jahren feierte Bacall außerdem große Erfolge als Theaterschauspielerin am Broadway. Für ihre Darstellungen in den Musicals Applause und Woman of the Year wurde sie jeweils mit dem Tony Award ausgezeichnet. Das American Film Institute wählte sie 1999 unter die 25 größten weiblichen Filmstars. 2009 erhielt sie den Ehrenoscar für ihr Lebenswerk.  Frühe Jahre Lauren Bacall wurde am 16. September 1924 als einziges Kind von William Perske (* 1889 als Wulf Perski in Polen; † 1982) und Natalie Perske, geb. Weinstein (* 1901 in Rumänien; † 1972), in der Bronx geboren. Ihre deutschstämmige Mutter war bereits als Kleinkind mit den Großeltern, Maximillian und Sophie Weinstein, in die Vereinigten Staaten gekommen. Die Vorfahren ihres Vaters stammten zum Teil aus Frankreich; Bacalls Cousin väterlicherseits ist der israelische Spitzenpolitiker und ehemalige Staatspräsident Schimon Peres. Die ersten Lebensjahre verbrachte Bacall in Brooklyn. Ihre Eltern ließen sich scheiden, als sie sechs Jahre alt war. Fortan lebte sie mit ihrer Mutter, die als Sekretärin arbeitete, bei den Großeltern in Manhattan. Der Kontakt zum Vater brach endgültig ab. Natalie Perske ließ sowohl ihren als auch den Nachnamen ihrer Tochter in Bacal, die rumänische Version ihres Geburtsnamens Weinstein, ändern. Später wurde daraus Bacall, um die Aussprache zu erleichtern. Mit finanzieller Unterstützung eines wohlhabenden Onkels besuchte Bacall die private Mädchenschule Highland Manor in Tarrytown, wo sie sich in der Theatergruppe engagierte. Später ging sie auf die Julia Richman High School in Manhattan und arbeitete ab ihrem 16. Lebensjahr nebenbei als Model. Während ihrer Schulzeit träumte sie zunächst davon, professionelle Tänzerin zu werden, entschied sich dann jedoch für die Schauspielerei und schrieb sich für ein Jahr an der New Yorker American Academy of Dramatic Arts ein. Dies ermöglichte es ihr, erste Bühnenerfahrungen in einigen Off-Broadway-Produktionen zu sammeln. Neben dem Schauspielstudium arbeitete sie als Platzanweiserin im St. James Theater. Der Theaterkritiker George Jean Nathan kürte sie in einem seiner Artikel für das Esquire Magazine zur „hübschesten Platzanweiserin“ Manhattans. „Das hat mir wirklich geschmeichelt. Die Aufmerksamkeit von jemandem zu erringen – irgendjemandem –, der in Theaterkreisen angesehen war, das war schon etwas. Es verschaffte mir keine Rolle, aber es konnte auch nicht schaden, und es war besser, als einfach in der Versenkung zu verschwinden“, erinnerte sich Bacall später. Von März bis Mai 1942 gab Bacall ihr Broadway-Debüt in Rowland Browns Johnny 2 × 4 am Longacre Theatre. Im gleichen Jahr gewann sie die Wahl zur „Miss Greenwich Village“ und erhielt ihre erste große Rolle in George Simon Kaufmans Theaterstück Franklin Street, das jedoch schon bei der Probeaufführung in Washington D.C. floppte und der Schauspielerin deshalb nicht den ersehnten Durchbruch verschaffen konnte. Anfänge der Hollywood-Karriere Einflussreiche Bekannte arrangierten 1942 ein Treffen zwischen Bacall und Diana Vreeland, damalige Moderedakteurin bei Harper’s Bazaar. Vreeland war hingerissen vom Aussehen der jungen Schauspielerin, und so schaffte Bacall es auf den Titel der Ausgabe des Magazins von März 1943. Nachdem der Hollywood-Regisseur Howard Hawks Bacalls Bild entdeckt hatte, lud er sie zu Probefilmaufnahmen ein. Bacall über Hawks: „Howard Hawks war es, der mein Leben verändert hat. Er war auf der Suche nach einem Mädchen, das er nach seinen Vorstellungen neu erfinden konnte, er wollte ein Sex-Symbol erschaffen und mich zu einem großen Star machen.“ Und Bacall war der Frauentyp, der Ende der 1930er und anfangs der 1940er in Hollywood gefragt war: starke Charaktere wie Bette Davis und Barbara Stanwyck definierten die klassische Frauenrolle neu; Frauen durften plötzlich kraftvoll und nicht nur einfach unergründlich sein. Um diesen Typ zu unterstreichen, nannte Bacall sich fortan nicht mehr Betty, sondern Lauren. Sie wurde von Warner Bros. unter Vertrag genommen, und Howard Hawks besetzte sie in seinem Film Haben und Nichthaben (1944), der gleichzeitig Bacalls Leinwanddebüt markierte, als Femme Fatale an der Seite von Hollywood-Größe Humphrey Bogart. Bacall erinnerte sich später an ihre Angst während der ersten Szene, in der sie Bogart um Feuer für ihre Zigarette fragt: „Meine Hand zitterte. Mein Kopf wackelte. Die Zigarette zitterte. Ich fragte mich, was Howard wohl denken musste. Was mussten Bogart und die Crew denken? Es war grauenhaft. Die einzige Möglichkeit, meinen Kopf still zu halten, war ihn zu senken, das Kinn fast bis auf die Brust, und mit den Augen zu Bogart aufzublicken.“ Diese Haltung und dieser Blick wurden – neben Bacalls heiser klingender Stimme – bald zu ihren Markenzeichen auf der Leinwand. Während der Dreharbeiten verliebten sich die damals 19-jährige Bacall und der 25 Jahre ältere Bogart ineinander, doch die Beziehung musste zunächst geheim gehalten werden, da Bogart noch mit der Schauspielerin Mayo Methot verheiratet war. Hawks, der bald von der Affäre seiner beiden Hauptdarsteller erfuhr, nutzte die Anziehungskraft zwischen Bogart und Bacall für seinen Film, indem er sie in noch mehr Szenen zusammen auftreten ließ. Haben und Nichthaben kam im Oktober 1944 in die US-amerikanischen Kinos und lockte das Filmpublikum, das sich von der Chemie zwischen Bacall und Bogart überzeugen wollte, in Scharen in die Vorstellungen. Nach der Scheidung von Methot heirateten Bogart und Bacall am 21. Mai 1945 auf einer Farm in Lucas County, Ohio. Im selben Jahr erschien Bacalls zweiter Film Jagd im Nebel an der Seite von Charles Boyer und Peter Lorre. In dem Film von Regisseur Herman Shumlin spielt Bacall eine englische Spionin, und sie musste sich für diese Rolle einen britischen Akzent aneignen. Später gab sie zu, dass ihr dies nicht besonders gut gelungen sei. Sie habe den Film nur gedreht, weil sie von Jack L. Warner in das Projekt gedrängt worden sei. Später wehrte sich Bacall erfolgreicher gegen Rollen, die ihr vom Filmstudio vorgeschrieben wurden, obwohl sie ihr nicht zusagten. „Wenn man nicht spielte, was das Studio von einem verlangte, wurde man suspendiert. Und ich wurde suspendiert! Ich hatte den Vertrag gebrochen. Studioboss Jack Warner hatte da eine einfache Philosophie: Ich bezahle sie, also wird sie verdammt noch mal machen, was ich von ihr will. Und er schickte mir schreckliche Drehbücher.“ In Tote schlafen fest (1946) arbeitete sie erneut mit Bogart und unter der Regie von Howard Hawks. Auch in Delmer Daves’ Die schwarze Natter (1947) und in John Hustons Gangster in Key Largo (1948) spielten Bacall und Bogart Seite an Seite. Ende der 1940er Jahre wurde Bacall schwanger, weshalb sie beruflich etwas kürzertrat, um sich um ihr und Bogarts erstes Kind, Steven Humphrey, kümmern zu können, der am 6. Januar 1949 geboren wurde. Karriere in den 1950/60er Jahren 1950 wirkte Bacall zweimal unter der Regie von Michael Curtiz bei den Filmen Der Mann ihrer Träume mit Kirk Douglas und Doris Day sowie Zwischen zwei Frauen an der Seite von Gary Cooper und Patricia Neal mit. Am 23. August 1952 kam Bacalls und Bogarts zweites Kind zur Welt. In ihrem ersten Film nach der Geburt von Tochter Leslie Howard spielte Bacall gemeinsam mit Marilyn Monroe und Betty Grable in Wie angelt man sich einen Millionär? (1953) von Regisseur Jean Negulesco. Mit ihm drehte sie ein Jahr später auch das Drama Die Welt gehört der Frau. 1955 bekamen Bacall und Bogart das Angebot, die Hauptrollen in William A. Wellmans Abenteuerfilm Der gelbe Strom zu spielen. Während sich Bacall mit den Produzenten einigte, lehnte Bogart die Rolle des Capt. Wilder ab, da das Filmbudget für seine Gagenforderung in Höhe von 500.000 US-Dollar nicht ausreichte. Den Part an der Seite Bacalls übernahm schließlich John Wayne, und der Film feierte seine Weltpremiere am 1. Oktober 1955. Danach war Bacall mit Rock Hudson in der Romanverfilmung In den Wind geschrieben (1956) zu sehen. Humphrey Bogart starb im Januar 1957 an Speiseröhrenkrebs in ihrem gemeinsamen Haus in Los Angeles. Bacall wurde mit 32 Jahren Witwe und alleinerziehende Mutter zweier Kinder im Alter von acht und vier Jahren. Später erinnerte sie sich: „Ich brauchte Jahre, um damit fertigzuwerden. Eigentlich bin ich bis heute nicht über seinen Tod hinweggekommen. Über solche Dinge kommt man nie hinweg.“ Einige Monate später ging sie eine kurze Affäre mit Frank Sinatra ein. Das Paar war auch kurze Zeit heimlich verlobt, Sinatra löste die Verbindung jedoch, nachdem die Presse davon erfahren hatte. Nach dem Tod ihres Ehemannes war Bacall erstmals mit Warum hab’ ich ja gesagt? (1957) wieder auf der Kinoleinwand zu sehen. Es folgten Geschenk der Liebe (1958) und der britische Abenteuerfilm Brennendes Indien (1959) von J. Lee Thompson. Danach zog es Bacall zurück an die Ostküste, wo sie von Dezember 1959 bis März 1960 in dem Broadway-Stück Goodbye, Charlie am Lyceum Theatre auf der Bühne stand. In New York lernte die Schauspielerin ihren Kollegen Jason Robards kennen, den sie im Jahr 1961 heiratete. Ihr gemeinsamer Sohn Sam Prideaux kam am 16. Dezember 1961 zur Welt. Auf der Kinoleinwand war Bacall in den 1960er Jahren nur sporadisch zu sehen. 1964 spielte sie in dem wenig beachteten Film Der Mörder mit der Gartenschere von Regisseur Denis Sanders und drehte mit Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood und Henry Fonda unter der Regie von Richard Quine die romantische Komödie … und ledige Mädchen. Schließlich war sie in Jack Smights Thriller Ein Fall für Harper (1966) zu sehen. Von Dezember 1965 bis November 1968 gab Bacall über 1000 Vorstellungen als Stephanie Dickinson in dem Broadway-Stück Cactus Flower, das später mit Ingrid Bergman und Walter Matthau in den Hauptrollen verfilmt wurde. 1969 wurden Bacall und Robards geschieden. Karriere in den 1970/80er Jahren Am 30. März 1970 feierte das Broadway-Musical Applause am New Yorker Palace Theatre seine Premiere. Bis Juli 1972 trat Bacall in über 800 Vorstellungen als Margo Channing auf und erhielt für diese Rolle den Tony Award als beste Hauptdarstellerin in einem Musical. In der Fernsehadaption des Stücks von 1973 übernahm Bacall abermals die Hauptrolle, die ihr eine Emmy-Nominierung einbrachte. Im Jahr 1974 fanden die Dreharbeiten zur Verfilmung von Agatha Christies Kriminalroman Murder on the Orient Express in Europa statt. In dem Film spielte Bacall unter der Regie von Sidney Lumet in einem starbesetzten Schauspielensemble, dem u. a. auch Ingrid Bergman, Vanessa Redgrave, Sean Connery, Albert Finney und John Gielgud angehörten. Mord im Orient-Expreß feierte seine Weltpremiere am 24. November 1974 in den Vereinigten Staaten. Mit ihrem Kollegen John Gielgud spielte Bacall 14 Jahre später erneut in einer Agatha Christie-Verfilmung: Rendezvous mit einer Leiche (1988). In Don Siegels Western The Shootist – Der letzte Scharfschütze (1976) spielte Bacall an der Seite von John Wayne, James Stewart und Ron Howard. Für die Rolle der Bond Rogers erhielt sie 1977 eine British-Academy-Film-Award-Nominierung als beste Hauptdarstellerin. The Shootist – Der letzte Scharfschütze war nicht nur John Waynes letzter Film, es war auch der letzte Kinofilm, in dem Bacall eine Hauptrolle spielte. 1978 war sie mit Ruth Gordon in dem Fernsehfilm Ladies mit weißer Weste nach dem Drehbuch von Nora Ephron und unter der Regie von Jackie Cooper zu sehen. An der Seite von James Garner war sie 1979 in einer Doppelfolge der Serie Detektiv Rockford – Anruf genügt erneut im Fernsehen zu sehen und erhielt für ihre Darstellung ihre zweite Nominierung für den Emmy. Auf die Kinoleinwand kehrte sie mit Robert Altmans Health – Der Gesundheits-Kongreß (1980) zurück, gefolgt von Edward Bianchis Der Fanatiker (1981). Von März 1981 bis März 1983 trat Bacall wieder am Broadway auf. Für ihre Rolle in dem Musical Woman of the Year gewann sie 1981 erneut einen Tony Award. Ende der 1980er drehte sie die Kinoproduktionen Mr. North – Liebling der Götter (1988) und Wahn des Herzens (1989) sowie die Fernsehfilme Dinner at Eight (1989) und Schatten über Sunshine (1990). Karriere seit 1990 In Rob Reiners Psychothriller Misery (1990) war sie neben Kathy Bates und James Caan in der Rolle einer Verlegerin zu sehen, und 1994 übernahm sie eine Nebenrolle in Robert Altmans Episodenfilm Prêt-à-Porter über den Pariser Modezirkus. Im Jahr 1996 spielte Lauren Bacall in Barbra Streisands romantischer Komödie Liebe hat zwei Gesichter die Mutter von Streisands Filmfigur Rose Morgan. Für ihre Darstellung der eitlen und überheblichen Hannah Morgan wurde Bacall von Filmkritikern gefeiert und mit zahlreichen Preisen geehrt, darunter eine Nominierung für den Oscar, die Auszeichnung mit dem Golden Globe als beste Nebendarstellerin und dem Screen Actors Guild Award. Mit Jack Lemmon, James Garner und Dan Aykroyd drehte sie unter der Regie von Peter Segal die Komödie Ein Präsident für alle Fälle (1996) und stand noch einmal mit Kirk Douglas in Diamonds (1999) vor der Kamera. In Lars von Triers Dogville (2003) und Birth (2004) spielte sie an der Seite von Nicole Kidman. Von Trier holte sie auch für sein Drama Manderlay (2005) vor die Kamera. In The Walker (2007) von Regisseur Paul Schrader übernahm sie ebenfalls eine Nebenrolle. Gemeinsam mit Schrader, Moritz Bleibtreu und Willem Dafoe stellte sie den Film bei der Berlinale vor, wo er auch im Wettbewerb lief. In der Fernsehserie Die Sopranos hatte sie 2006 einen Gastauftritt neben Ben Kingsley, in welchem die beiden sich selbst darstellen. Auch in Natalie Portmans Regiedebüt, dem Kurzfilm Eve (2008), war sie zu sehen. Anfang September 2009 wurde der Schauspielerin der Ehrenoscar zugesprochen, den sie am 14. November 2009 erhielt. In Interviews sagte Bacall über ihre andauernde Arbeit als Schauspielerin trotz ihres hohen Alters: Am 12. August 2014 starb sie im Alter von 89 Jahren in ihrer Wohnung im Dakota Building in New York City an den Folgen eines Schlaganfalls. |
G;|Pawel Alexejewitsch Rotmistrow (russisch Павел Алексеевич Ротмистров; * 23. Junijul./ 6. Juli 1901greg. in Skoworowo (heute Rajon Selischarowo, Oblast Twer); † 6. April 1982 in Moskau) war ein sowjetischer Hauptmarschall der Panzertruppen und Professor an der Militärakademie der Panzertruppen der Roten Armee. Er war der Befehlshaber großer sowjetischer Panzerverbände während des Deutsch-Sowjetischen Krieges und in der Zeit des Kalten Krieges.    Rotmistrow wuchs in einer großen bäuerlichen Familie auf. Er hatte insgesamt acht Geschwister. Aufgrund seiner Herkunft hatte er zunächst eine geringe Schulbildung, die nicht über einen höheren Grundschulabschluss im Jahr 1916 hinausging. Danach schlug er sich als Gelegenheitsarbeiter durch und war bei der Eisenbahn in Peno beschäftigt sowie Holzfäller an der oberen Wolga. Im Jahr 1917 kam er nach Samara, wo er als Verladegehilfe arbeitete. Russischer Bürgerkrieg In Samara trat Rotmistrow während der Revolutionswirren und der kurzzeitigen Rückeroberung der Stadt durch Weiße Truppen bis zum Ende des Jahres 1918 nicht in Erscheinung. Im März 1919 beteiligte er sich an der Niederschlagung des antibolschewistischen Aufstands im Melekessker Ujesd (russisch Чапанная Война, Tschapan-Krieg). Im April 1919 trat er in die Rote Armee ein und wurde Teil des Samarer Arbeiter-Regiments. Zeitgleich wurde er Mitglied der Kommunistischen Partei Russlands. Nach seinem Eintritt in die Rote Armee nahm er an den Kämpfen gegen die Truppen des Admirals Koltschak (21. Juni 1919 – 7. Januar 1920) und am Sowjetisch-Polnischen Krieg teil (Januar 1920 – Dezember 1920). Im März 1921 nahm er an der Niederschlagung des Kronstädter Matrosenaufstands teil. Rotmistrow gehörte zu den ersten sowjettreuen Soldaten, die in die Festung am Fort Nr. 6 einbrachen. Er wurde im Kampf verwundet, konnte jedoch ein MG-Nest der Verteidiger ausschalten. Für seine Tapferkeit wurde er mit dem Rotbannerorden ausgezeichnet. Zwischenkriegszeit Nach dem Ende des Bürgerkriegs absolvierte Rotmistrow die Infanterie-Schule Smolensk. Er diente als Politoffizier in Rjasan im 149. und 51. Schützen-Regiment. 1924 absolvierte er einen Lehrgang an der Militärschule „WZIK“ und wurde danach als Zugführer eingesetzt. Vom März 1928 bis zum Oktober desselben Jahres wurde er als Kommandeur einer Batterie des 11. Artillerie-Regiments eingesetzt. Danach wurde er stellvertretender Kommandeur eines Bataillons des 34. Schützen-Regiment im Leningrader Militärbezirk. 1931 absolvierte er erfolgreich die Frunse-Militärakademie in Moskau und wurde daraufhin als erster Stabsoffizier in der 36. Schützen-Division in Tschita eingesetzt. Ab März 1936 war er erster Stabsoffizier in der Besonderen Rotbanner-Fernostarmee. Rotmistrow gehörte zu denjenigen Offizieren in der Roten Armee, die vom Großen Terror profitierten. Im Juni 1937 wurde er zum Kommandeur des elitären 63. Rotbanner-Regiments „M. W. Frunse“ in der 21. Zweifach-Rotbanner-Marineschützen-Division „S.S. Kamenew“. Im Oktober 1937 wurde er aus dem Fernen Osten nach Moskau an das Taktische Institut der Militärakademie für Mechanisierung und Motorisierung der Roten Armee „I. W. Stalin“ versetzt. Im Jahr 1939 begann Rotmistrow seine Doktorarbeit über den Kriegseinsatz von Panzertruppen. Wenig später wurde er denunziert, Verbindungen zu Volksfeinden zu haben und aus der KPdSU ausgeschlossen. Er wurde aber nicht verhaftet, weil er gegen die Entscheidung des Parteibüros der Militärakademie Beschwerde einlegte. Einige Monate später wurde er auf Weisung des ZK der KPdSU wieder in die sowjetische Regierungspartei aufgenommen, der Ausschluss wurde durch einen Verweis ersetzt. 1940 verteidigte er seine Dissertation, erhielt den Titel Doktor der Militärwissenschaften und wurde zum Oberstleutnant befördert. Winterkrieg und Zeit kurz vor dem Ausbruch des Deutsch-Sowjetischen Krieges Im Frühjahr 1940 wurde Rotmistrow an die Front des Winterkrieges versetzt, um Erfahrungen im Kampf mit Panzertruppen zu sammeln. Er wurde offiziell als Kommandeur einer Reservegruppe der Nordwestfront eingesetzt. Auf persönlichen Wunsch wurde er Kommandeur eines mit T-26 ausgestatteten Panzerbataillons der 35. leichten Panzerbrigade der 7. sowjetischen Armee. Er nahm am Durchbruch der Mannerheim-Linie und der Einschließung Wyborgs teil. Für ihre erfolgreichen Operationen am Ende Winterkriegs wurde die 35. leichte Panzerbrigade mit dem Rotbannerorden ausgezeichnet. Rotmistrow erhielt den Orden des Roten Sterns. Im Dezember 1940 wurde Rotmistrow zum stellvertretenden Kommandeur der 5. Panzer-Division des 3. Mechanisierten Korps im speziellen baltischen Militärbezirk in Alytus (heute Litauen) ernannt. Ab Mai 1941 war er in Kaunas Stabschef des 3. Mechanisierten Korps. Deutsch-Sowjetischer Krieg In Litauen begann für Rotmistrow der Deutsch-Sowjetische Krieg. Das 3. Mechanisierte Korps war wie viele andere sowjetische Panzerverbände nur mit leichten Panzern der Typen T-26 bzw. der BT-Serie ausgestattet. Die Verluste des Korps waren verheerend. Bereits am fünften Tag des Krieges eroberten deutsche Truppen das Verwaltungsgebäude und das Hauptquartier der 2. Panzer-Division, in der ein Teil des Korpsstabes untergebracht war. Mehr als zwei Monate lang schlug sich Rotmistrow nach der Vernichtung des 3. Mechanisierten Korps in einer Gruppe von Soldaten und Offizieren durch die Wälder von Litauen und Weißrussland ca. 500 Kilometer bis nach Brjansk zu den sowjetischen Linien durch. Für diese Leistung wurde er zum Oberst befördert. Schlacht um Moskau Im September 1941 wurde Rotmistrow zum Kommandeur der 8. Panzer-Brigade der 11. Armee der Nordwestfront ernannt. Im Oktober 1941 wurde die Brigade, bestehend aus einem Panzer-Regiment und einem mechanisierten Infanterie-Bataillon, in Nachtmärschen über eine Distanz von 250 Kilometern von Waldai nach Dumanowo verlegt. Am 14. Oktober näherte sich die Brigade dem Dorf Kalikino bei der Stadt Kalinin (heute Twer). Dort wurde sie als Teil einer operativen Gruppe unter dem Befehl von Nikolai Fjodorowitsch Watutin bei der Verteidigung der Leningrader Autobahn im Abschnitt Mednoje – Kalinin eingesetzt. (→Schlacht um Moskau) Im Dezember 1941 nahm Rotmistrow an der sowjetischen Gegenoffensive vor Moskau teil und war an der Rückeroberung der Stadt Klin beteiligt. Danach wurde die 8. Panzer-Brigade in die 30. sowjetische Armee der Kalininer Front eingegliedert. Dort nahm sie an den Kämpfen um die Stadt Rschew teil. Im Januar 1942 wurde die 8. Panzer-Brigade ehrenhalber in 3. Garde-Panzer-Brigade umbenannt. Rotmistrow erhielt für seine Leistungen während der sowjetischen Winteroffensive den Leninorden. Kämpfe bei Woronesch Im März 1942 erhielt Rotmistrow den Auftrag, aus der 3. Garde-Panzer-Brigade bei Kalinin das 7. Panzer-Korps zu formieren. Im April 1942 wurde er der Korpskommandeur des neu aufgestellten Korps, das weiterhin im Bereich des Frontbogens von Rschew eingesetzt blieb. Am 28. Juni 1942 begann die deutsche Offensive mit dem Tarnnamen Fall Blau. Die deutschen Truppen durchbrachen im Gebiet von Ostrogoschsk die sowjetische Frontlinie und stießen schnell auf Woronesch vor. Das Korps von Rotmistrow wurde eilig auf Züge verladen und bei Jelez der 5. Panzerarmee unter Generalmajor Alexander Iljitsch Lisjukow angegliedert. Die 5. Panzerarmee erhielt den Auftrag, sofort einen Gegenschlag auf die deutsche Panzergruppe bei Woronesch zu führen. Das 7. Panzer-Korps griff die 11. deutsche Panzer-Division bei Jelez an und schlug sie zurück. Aufgrund der ungeschickten und hastig ausgeführten Organisation der Operation wurde das Ziel der Zerschlagung der deutschen Verbände nicht erreicht. Drei gut ausgestattete Panzerkorps wurden im Abstand von zwei Tagen ohne Erfolg in den Kampf geschickt. Im Juli 1942 wurde Rotmistrow zum Generalmajor der Panzertruppen befördert. Schlacht um Stalingrad Am 25. August 1942 wurde das 7. Panzer-Korps zur 1. Garde-Panzer-Armee der Stalingrader Front verlegt. Im September 1942 erhielt die 1. Garde-Panzer-Armee den Auftrag, sofort die deutschen Linien um Stalingrad zu durchbrechen und den Feind zurückzuschlagen. Dieser erneut hastig und ungeschickt initiierte Angriff endete in einem Desaster. Nach drei Tagen Kampf waren von ursprünglich 180 Panzern des 7. Panzer-Korps nur noch 15 einsatzbereit. Die Reste des Korps wurden in die Reserve verlegt. Nach der notwendigen Auffrischung war Rotmistrows Korps im Dezember 1942 an der Abwehr des deutschen Gegenschlages Unternehmen Wintergewitter beteiligt, der der eingeschlossenen 6. deutschen Armee den Ausbruch aus Stalingrad ermöglichen sollte. Am 24. Dezember griff Rotmistrows 7. Panzer-Korps zusammen mit weiteren Verbänden die Frontlinie der Armeegruppe Hoth an und drängte sie zurück. Am 28. Dezember eroberte das Korps Kotelnikowo und am Nachmittag des gleichen Tages auch den deutschen Feldflugplatz bei der Stadt. Durch diesen Gegenangriff war das Schicksal der bei Stalingrad eingeschlossenen deutschen Truppen besiegelt. Für die schnelle Eroberung des Flugplatzes wurde das 7. Panzer-Korps am 29. Dezember in 3. Garde-Panzer-Korps “Kotelnikowo” umbenannt. Im Januar 1943 wurde das 3. Garde-Panzer-Korps mit der 2. Garde-Panzer-Armee bei den sowjetischen Gegenoffensiven eingesetzt, die im Februar zur Rückeroberung der Stadt Rostow am Don führten. Für die gute Führung des 3. Garde-Panzer-Korps erhielt Rotmistrow am 22. Februar 1942 den Rang Generalleutnant der Panzertruppen. Er wurde mit dem Suworoworden zweiter Klasse ausgezeichnet und erhielt den Befehl über die im März 1943 neu aufzustellende 5. Garde-Panzerarmee. Panzergefecht bei Prochorowka Rotmistrows Armee befand sich die folgenden Monate bis zum Beginn der deutschen Offensive Unternehmen Zitadelle in einer Reserveposition bei der Woronescher Front. Ihr erster Einsatz fand am 12. Juli 1943 bei dem sowjetischen Gegenangriff auf die südliche deutsche Angriffsspitze bei Prochorowka statt. Rotmistrows Armee bestand zu Beginn der Kämpfe aus 838 einsatzbereiten Kampfwagen, eine Reserve von 96 Panzern wurde noch herangeführt. Rotmistrows Angriffsplan sah zwei Angriffskeile aus ca. 400 bzw. 200 Panzern vor, die die deutschen Verbände angreifen sollten. Es gelang ihm bis zum 9. Juli, seine enorme Streitmacht über eine Distanz von ca. 330 km von der deutschen Aufklärung unbemerkt in Frontnähe bei Prochorowka zu verlegen. Als er sich zusammen mit Marschall Wassilewski südwestlich von Prochorowka in Frontnähe begab, beobachteten beide eine Panzer-Kolonne, die aus einiger Entfernung auf sie zufuhr. Wassilewski fuhr Rotmistrow an, warum die Panzer der 5. Garde-Panzerarmee bei hellem Tageslicht vor den Augen der Deutschen spazieren fahren würden. Erst als die Panzer das Feuer eröffneten, erkannten beide, dass es sich um deutsche Truppen handelte. Wassilewski reagierte über und verlangte von Rotmistrow einen sofortigen Gegenangriff, der bereits am 11. Juli gegen 20:00 stattfinden sollte. Nach einigen Verschiebungen trat die 5. Garde-Panzerarmee am 12. Juli gegen 7:30 tatsächlich zum Angriff an, ohne eine ausreichende Erkundung des Geländes durchgeführt zu haben. Der Erfolg der Attacke wäre unabwendbar gewesen, wenn Rotmistrow und sein Stab nicht bei der von der Stawka verursachten hastigen Ausarbeitung seines Angriffsplans einen sowjetischen Panzerabwehrgraben übersehen hätten, in den die Masse seiner Panzer fuhr. Dieser Faktor und die von Rotmistrow selbst festgestellte technische Überlegenheit der neuen deutschen Panzermodelle führten dazu, dass die 5. Garde-Panzerarmee am 12. Juli etwa 53 Prozent ihrer Panzer verlor, ohne nennenswerte Verluste auf deutscher Seite zu verursachen. Stalin fuhr Rotmistrow persönlich mit den Worten an: “Was haben Sie ihrer prachtvollen Panzer-Armee angetan ?” und beabsichtigte ihn vor ein Kriegsgericht zu stellen. Dies unterblieb, da die Stawka selbst für den ungeeigneten Einsatzzeitpunkt verantwortlich war und die übriggebliebenen Panzer der 5. Garde-Panzerarmee schnell wieder in Einsatzbereitschaft versetzt werden konnten. Operation Rumjanzew Anfang August war Rotmistrows Panzer-Armee bereit, einen weiteren Angriff auf die deutschen Linien zu führen. (→ Belgorod-Charkower Operation) Am 3. August durchbrachen die 1. sowjetische Panzer-Armee und Rotmistrows 5. Garde-Panzerarmee die deutschen Verteidigungsstellungen nördlich von Belgorod und stießen nach Süden vor. Dieses Mal war der Einsatz der 5. Garde-Panzerarmee erfolgreich, denn bereits am 5. August 1943 wurde Belgorod zurückerobert. Der sowjetische Panzer-Vorstoß wurde erst bei dem Ort Boguduchow ab dem 12. August 1943 durch einen Gegenangriff der SS-Panzergrenadier-Divisionen “Das Reich” und “Totenkopf” aufgehalten. Während der sich dort bis zum 17. August hinziehenden Gefechte büßte die 5. Garde-Panzerarmee fast alle ihre restlichen Panzer ein. Sie bestand am 28. August 1943 nur noch aus 50 einsatzbereiten Fahrzeugen. Im September 1943 wurde Rotmistrow zum Generaloberst der Panzertruppen befördert. Rückeroberung der Ukraine Ab September 1943 nahm die 5. Garde-Panzerarmee an der Schlacht am Dnepr teil, wobei sie ständig aufgefrischt wurde. Im Januar 1944 war die Armee während der Dnepr-Karpaten-Operation an der Einschließung von ca. 80.000 deutschen Soldaten bei Korsun beteiligt. Für seine Leistungen während dieser Kesselschlacht wurde Rotmistrow zum Marschall der Panzertruppen befördert. Im März 1944 war die 5. Garde-Panzerarmee an der Uman-Botoşaner Operation beteiligt, wobei es Rotmistrow gelang, den Fluss Pruth am 28. März 1944 aus der Bewegung heraus zu überqueren. Operation Bagration Im April 1944 wurde die 5. Garde-Panzerarmee aus der Front in der Ukraine herausgelöst und zur Auffrischung in das sowjetische Hinterland verlegt. Die Armee wurde der 3. Weißrussischen Front zugeteilt und sollte den nördlichen Angriffskeil bei der geplanten Umfassung der deutschen Heeresgruppe Mitte bilden. (→Operation Bagration) Nach dem Beginn der sowjetischen Offensive überrollte die inzwischen mit Panzern des Typs IS-2 ausgestattete 5. Garde-Panzerarmee bei dem Ort Boguschewsk eine letzte Abwehrstellung der 3. deutschen Panzerarmee und drang dann entlang der Autobahn Minsk – Moskau nach Südwesten vor. Vor Borissow traf die 5. Garde-Panzerarmee am 27. Juni 1944 auf die 5. deutsche Panzer-Division und wurde dort in heftige Kämpfe verwickelt, die zu großen Verlusten führten. Erst am 1. Juli 1944 gelang es Rotmistrow die Beresina bei Borissow zu überschreiten und auf Minsk vorzustoßen. Die weißrussische Hauptstadt wurde am 3. Juli 1944 von den Panzern der 5. Garde-Panzerarmee eingenommen. Danach schwenkte die Armee in Richtung Vilnius und nahm bis zum 14. Juli 1944 an den Kämpfen zur Rückeroberung dieser Stadt teil. Nach dem Ende der Schlacht um Vilnius war die Gefechtsstärke der sowjetischen 5. Garde-Panzerarmee aufgrund hoher Verluste auf 50 einsatzbereite Panzer des Typs IS-2 geschrumpft. Am 16. Juli 1944 wurde Rotmistrow deswegen auf Antrag von Armeegeneral Iwan Danilowitsch Tschernjachowski von seinem Frontkommando entbunden. Für die verbleibende Dauer des Deutsch-Sowjetischen Krieges erhielt Rotmistrow kein weiteres Frontkommando. Stattdessen wurde er zum stellvertretenden Befehlshaber der Panzer- und mechanisierten Truppen der Roten Armee ernannt. Leben nach dem Ende des Deutsch-Sowjetischen Krieges Nach dem Deutsch-Sowjetischen Krieg war Rotmistrow Kommandeur der Panzer- und mechanisierten Kräfte der Gruppe der Roten Armee in Deutschland und dann in der gleichen Funktion im Fernen Osten. Seit 1948 war er stellvertretender Leiter der Höheren Militärakademie “K.E. Woroschilow”. 1956 habilitierte er und wurde 1958 Professor an der Militärakademie der Panzertruppen. Gleichzeitig übernahm er bis 1964 die Leitung der Akademie. Für seine Dienste bei der Entwicklung der militärischen Theorie des Panzerkampfs und bei der Ausbildung von Offizieren der Roten Armee wurde Rotmistrow 1962 zum Hauptmarschall der Panzertruppen befördert. Seit 1964 war Rotmistrow Abgeordneter des Verteidigungsministeriums der UdSSR in den höheren militärischen Lehranstalten. Am 7. Mai 1965 wurde er mit dem Orden Held der Sowjetunion und dem Leninorden ausgezeichnet. Ab 1968 war er in der Gruppe der Generalinspektoren des Verteidigungsministeriums der UdSSR. |
G;|Marius Müller-Westernhagen (* 6. Dezember 1948 in Düsseldorf), später auch nur Westernhagen, ist ein deutscher Rock-Musiker und Schauspieler. Mit rund 11,2 Millionen verkauften Tonträgern gilt er als einer der erfolgreichsten deutschen Musiker. Sein Vater war der Schauspieler Hans Müller-Westernhagen.  Familie Marius Müller-Westernhagen wurde 1948 in Düsseldorf geboren und wuchs zusammen mit seiner zwei Jahre älteren Schwester Christiane im linksrheinischen Stadtteil Heerdt auf. Sein Vater Hans war Mitglied des Ensembles des Düsseldorfer Schauspielhauses zur Zeit des Intendanten Gustaf Gründgens; er starb am 18. Dezember 1963 im Alter von 44 Jahren. Seine Mutter war die Angestellte Liselotte Müller-Westernhagen, die im Jahre 1999 starb. Das schwierige Verhältnis von Mutter und Sohn sowie der frühe Verlust des Vaters waren immer wieder Gegenstände seiner Liedtexte (wie z. B. in Was Du … aus dem Album In den Wahnsinn). Erst in den 1990er-Jahren kam es zur Versöhnung. Liselotte Müller-Westernhagen ist auch im Film Keine Zeit zu sehen. 1988 heiratete Marius Müller-Westernhagen das Fotomodell Romney Williams aus New York, die aus erster Ehe den Sohn Giulio hat. Das Paar trennte sich im Jahre 2013. Müller-Westernhagen hat aus der früheren Beziehung mit der Schauspielerin und Fotografin Polly Eltes die gemeinsame Tochter Sarah („Mimi“), britisches Model und Sängerin in einer Rockband. Die ersten künstlerischen Schritte Noch vor dem Tod seines Vaters hatte der 14-jährige Marius seinen ersten Auftritt in dem Fernsehfilm Die Höhere Schule nach Scholem Alejchem unter der Regie von Wilhelm Semmelroth. Die erste Gage wurde vom DEG-Fan umgehend in eine Eishockey-Ausrüstung investiert. Marius Müller-Westernhagen entschied sich, beim Schauspiel zu bleiben. 1965 übernahm er die Sprechrolle für die Hauptfigur bei der WDR-Hörspiel-Produktion von Wickie und die starken Männer. In der zweiten Hälfte der 1960er Jahre widmete sich Müller-Westernhagen der Musik, brachte sich selbst das Gitarrenspiel bei und begann eine klassische Gesangsausbildung. Stimmlich erreichte er bereits die „Shouterqualität“, die sein gesangliches Markenzeichen wurde und an Steve Marriott von der damals sehr populären Band The Small Faces erinnerte. In der damals sehr lebendigen Düsseldorfer Musikszene brachte er es Ende der 1960er mit seiner Band Harakiri Whoom bereits zu lokaler Bekanntheit. Mit dem im Jahr 1978 erschienenen Titel Mit 18 thematisierte er diese musikalische Jugendzeit (Textzeile: „Mit 18 rannt’ ich in Düsseldorf rum – war Sänger in ’ner Rock’n Roll Band“). Mit dem Namen der Band entstand 1968 auch ein Film, eine Politsatire, die zum Skandal geriet und zunächst nicht ausgestrahlt wurde. Nach Auflösung von Harakiri Whoom widmete Müller-Westernhagen sich der Tätigkeit als Schauspieler, Sänger und Journalist. Anfang der 1970er Jahre zog Müller-Westernhagen mit seiner Lebensgefährtin, der 17 Jahre älteren Schauspielerin Katrin Schaake, nach Hamburg-Pöseldorf. Häufig war er Gast in der Künstler-Wohngemeinschaft Villa Kunterbunt in Hamburg-Winterhude, in der damals unter anderem Otto Waalkes, Udo Lindenberg und Willem wohnten. 1972 brachte er für die ZDF-Satiresendung Express das Lied Gebt Bayern zurück an die Bayern in Anlehnung an Paul McCartneys Give Ireland Back to the Irish auf den Markt. Nach massiven Protesten wurde die Single von der Plattenfirma wieder vom Markt genommen. In Roland Klicks Film Supermarkt synchronisierte er den Hauptdarsteller und steuerte das Stück Celebration für den Soundtrack unter dem Namen Marius West bei. Während der Arbeiten zum Film lernte er den Produzenten Peter Hesslein kennen. 1974 unterzeichnete er einen Plattenvertrag bei Warner Music. Sein Debüt-Album Das erste Mal wurde von Peter Hesslein im Oktober 1974 produziert und Anfang 1975 veröffentlicht. Es war kommerziell nicht erfolgreich. Die ARD strahlte im selben Jahr unter dem Titel Es geht mir wie dir eine Dokumentation über den jungen Sänger aus, in der Müller-Westernhagen und einige ihm nahestehende Personen, wie seine Mutter und seine Lebensgefährtin, dem Moderator Reinhard Münchenhagen Fragen über sein Leben und seine Musik beantworten. Die ersten größeren Erfolge Sein schauspielerischer Durchbruch gelang Marius Müller-Westernhagen mit dem 1976 gedrehten Film Aufforderung zum Tanz als LKW-Fahrer „Theo Gromberg“. Die Geschichte um die Fernfahrer Gromberg und Goldini (der Italiener Goldini wurde vom späteren Lindenstraßen-Darsteller Guido Gagliardi verkörpert) fand 1980 ihre bedeutend erfolgreichere Fortsetzung im Kino-Film Theo gegen den Rest der Welt. Dieser Film unter der Regie von Peter F. Bringmann wurde zum erfolgreichsten Film des Jahres und mit fast drei Millionen Zuschauern auch einer der kommerziell erfolgreichsten deutschen Nachkriegsfilme überhaupt. Im selben Jahr erhielt Müller-Westernhagen den Ernst-Lubitsch-Preis für seine darstellerische Leistung. Zu dieser Zeit befand sich Müller-Westernhagen auf dem Höhepunkt seines schauspielerischen Ruhms. Neben den Musikalben nahm Westernhagen, der in jungen Jahren mehrfach für den Hörfunk als Hörspielsprecher tätig war, Tonträger mit gesprochenen Texten auf, einmal Texte von Wolfgang Borchert, dann das musikalische Märchen Peter und der Wolf und Die Geschichte von Babar, dem kleinen Elefanten von Francis Poulenc. Nach zwei weiteren erfolglosen LPs bekam seine musikalische Karriere mit dem 1978 erschienenen Album Mit Pfefferminz bin ich dein Prinz Aufwind. Es entstand in enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem Produzenten und Bassisten Lothar Meid, erreichte hohe Verkaufszahlen und verkaufte sich bis heute über 1,5 Millionen Mal. Als Musiker fiel er zunehmend durch häufig sehr provokante Texte auf. Zum Skandal geriet die Single Dicke, wobei ihm vorgeworfen wurde, sich über fettleibige Menschen lustig zu machen. In einem anderen Titel thematisierte er die damalige Hysterie um die RAF-Terroristen (Grüß mir die Genossen). An den massiven Erfolg des Pfefferminz-Albums konnte er lange Jahre nicht mehr anschließen, obwohl die Nachfolge-LPs Sekt oder Selters (1980) und Stinker (1981) kommerziell erfolgreich waren. 1981 nahm er das Titellied für den Tatort-Krimi „Grenzgänger“ mit Götz George (Schimanski) Hier in der Kneipe fühl ich mich frei auf. Zu dieser Zeit startete Müller-Westernhagen sehr erfolgreiche Tourneen. Die 1980er Jahre: Imagewechsel und Experimente Zwischen 1982 und 1986 erschienen fünf Alben, auf denen teilweise mit Synthesizern experimentiert wurde und auf denen Müller-Westernhagen auch Mackie Messer von Brecht und Weill coverte (zu hören auf Die Sonne so rot von 1984). Zu seiner erfolgreichsten Veröffentlichung wurde in dieser Zeit das Album Laß uns leben (erschienen 1985), eine Zusammenstellung von Balladen seiner bis dahin veröffentlichten LPs. In dieser Zeit wirkte Müller-Westernhagen beim Projekt Band für Afrika mit. Außerdem absolvierte er zu den Alben recht erfolgreiche Tourneen. Hier erarbeitete er sich den Ruf eines exzellenten Live-Künstlers. Auch trat er in den 1980er Jahren mehrmals beim Festival Rock am Ring auf. Bei den Dreharbeiten zu dem Kinofilm "Der Schneemann" (Regie: Peter F. Bringmann) verliebte sich MMW in die britische Schauspielerin Polly Eltes, mit der er 1985 Tochter Sarah, genannt Mimi, bekam. 1988 heiratete er das Model Romney Williams, die einen Sohn aus einer früheren Beziehung mit in die Ehe brachte und mit der er bis Ende 2013 zusammenlebte. Die größere private Verbindung fand ihren Ausdruck auch in seinem künstlerischen Schaffen. Seinen Schauspielberuf ließ er 1987 nach der Christoph-Blumenberg-Produktion Der Madonna-Mann hinter sich und produzierte das Album Westernhagen, mit dem er sich vom Image des burschikosen Pöblers „Marius“ verabschiedete und nunmehr zum gut gekleideten, adretten und arrogant wirkenden „Westernhagen“ geriet, was bei vielen Fans der ersten Stunde zu Irritationen führte. Auch „Müller“ mit Bindestrich tilgte er mit diesem Album aus seinem Namen. Der Imagewechsel brachte ihm zuweilen den Ruf als "Armani-Rocker" ein. Dennoch wurde das Album viel beachtet und enthielt Lieder, die inzwischen fast zu Klassikern geworden sind (wie z. B. Ganz und gar und Weißt Du, daß ich glücklich bin), vor allem aber der Song Freiheit, welcher seit 1989 als Lied-Synonym der deutschen Wiedervereinigung gilt. Die 1990er Jahre: Zurück auf der Erfolgsspur Nach der Hochzeit mit Romney Williams entstand 1989 das 13. und bis dahin erfolgreichste Album Halleluja, das den Sprung von Null auf Platz eins der Musikmarkt-Hitparade schaffte. Es folgten 50 ausverkaufte Konzerte und eine Million verkaufte Tonträger in nur einem Jahr. Außerdem trat Westernhagen innerhalb der Tour zum ersten Mal in der DDR auf. Im Frühjahr 1990 fand ein Konzert in der Ost-Berliner Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle statt. Das Abschlusskonzert der Tournee fand im Gelsenkirchener Parkstadion statt. Im Dezember 1990 erschien das Doppelalbum Westernhagen live, dessen Aufnahmen während der Halleluja-Tour in den Dortmunder Westfalenhallen entstanden. Bis heute wurden davon mehr als 1,5 Millionen Einheiten verkauft, wofür es dreimal mit Platin ausgezeichnet wurde. Das dazugehörige Live-Video wurde ebenfalls zu einem Kassenschlager. 1992 nahm er in den Londoner Metropolis Studios, diesmal als Produzent alleine in der Verantwortung, das Album Jaja auf. Die Tournee zu diesem Album führte ihn nicht nur durch die größten Hallen der Bundesrepublik, sondern auch – als ersten deutschen Künstler – durch große Fußballstadien. Ein Jahr später wurde Jaja doppelt mit Platin geehrt. Westernhagen wurde 1993 mit drei Echo-Auszeichnungen (Künstler des Jahres, Musikvideo des Jahres, Produzent des Jahres), dem Silver Screen Award für das Musikvideo Krieg und mit dem Bambi in der Kategorie Pop geehrt. Im Jahre 1994 erschien dann das Album Affentheater. Es wurde in Großbritannien produziert, diesmal mit Pete Wingfield als Co-Producer. Für das Album lagen 700.000 Vorbestellungen vor, und es erreichte auf Anhieb Platz 1 der Verkaufshitparade. Obwohl von den Medien inzwischen zum „Armani-Rocker“ stilisiert und als mehrfacher Millionär ausgemacht, galt er bei den Fans weiterhin als Kumpeltyp. Die Tournee zum Album, Affentour genannt, führte diesmal ausschließlich durch Stadien. Die fünfzehn Konzerte wurden von dem Dokumentarfilmer D. A. Pennebaker und dessen Partnerin Chris Hegedus für die Leinwand festgehalten. Im Gegensatz zum beeindruckenden Erfolg der Tourneen geriet der Tourfilm Keine Zeit jedoch zum Flop. Trotz Kritikerlob wurde das Werk angesichts leerer Kinosäle oft schon nach zwei Wochen aus den Programmen genommen. Vier Jahre nach Affentheater erschien Radio Maria mit zwölf neuen Songs, die im italienischen Refugium der Westernhagens vorproduziert wurden. Dort streute ein religiöser Sender die Gebete der Gläubigen in die Studioanlage ein, daher der Titel. Auch dieses Album sorgte für Platz 1, Gold und Platin bei Auslieferung und in der Folge eine Tournee der Superlative, die gleichzeitig zu einer Abschiedstour werden sollte. Von Westernhagen und einem internationalen kreativen Team in eineinhalbjähriger Vorbereitungszeit erarbeitet, wurden u.a. ein riesiger beweglicher Monitor-Satellit, auf dem eigens für die Songs interpretierendes Filmmaterial lief, Lichtdesign von Patrick Woodroffe, eine 570 Tonnen schwere Bühne mit langen Catwalks sowie eine Tonanlage mit 200.000 Watt präsentiert. Mit dem letzten Konzert der Tournee in Hamburg vor über 100.000 Zuschauern erklärte Müller-Westernhagen seinen vorläufigen Abschied von den Stadion-Bühnen. In einem Stern-Interview gab Westernhagen zu Protokoll, er könne sich mit dem „PR-Gewese“ nicht mehr identifizieren, und dass es definitiv keine Stadion-Tour mehr geben werde. Im Herbst 2000 erschien die Best-of-Kopplung So weit … in einfacher sowie in XL-Version – 18 bzw. 29 Titel. Auch diese Veröffentlichung wurde ein großer Erfolg. Im neuen Jahrtausend Für sein gesellschaftspolitisches Engagement wurde Marius Müller-Westernhagen vom Bundespräsidenten Johannes Rau das Bundesverdienstkreuz am Bande verliehen und am 4. April 2001 von Bundeskanzler Gerhard Schröder im Kaisersaal des Hamburger Rathauses überreicht. Im September 2002 wurde nach einer längeren Kreativpause das in Hamburg vorproduzierte und in Italien aufgenommene Album In den Wahnsinn veröffentlicht, auf dem sich harte Rocksongs mit aggressiven Texten finden. Allerdings konnte dieses Album nicht an frühere Verkaufszahlen anknüpfen. Im Frühjahr 2005 erschien das Album Nahaufnahme, für dessen Coverfoto unter anderem Karl Lagerfeld Verantwortung zeichnete. Die Songs dieses Albums sind ruhig gehalten, die Texte eher nachdenklich. Wie bereits bei In den Wahnsinn bleiben auch die Verkaufszahlen von Nahaufnahme hinter früheren Erfolgen zurück. Es erreichte lediglich einfachen Goldstatus für 100.000 verkaufte Exemplare. Dieses Album nahm Müller-Westernhagen zum Anlass, im Spätsommer 2005 sein Comeback auch auf der Bühne zu feiern. Gegenüber seinen letzten Touren spielte er dieses Mal nicht in Fußballstadien, sondern in ausgesuchten Hallen in Deutschland. Auf dieser Tour arbeitete er wieder mit bewährten Weggefährten zusammen, wie zum Beispiel dem Gitarristen Jay Stapley und dem Keyboarder Helmut Zerlett. Trotz des im Vorfeld in zahlreichen Internet-Foren geäußerten Unmuts über die hohen Ticketpreise (inklusive Gebühren im Schnitt etwa 70 € für Stehplatzkarten) sahen über 250.000 Zuschauer die Konzerte der fast ausverkauften Nahaufnahme-Tour. Im Herbst 2006 erschien die dazugehörige Live-DVD Wenn das Licht auf dich fällt, die später auch eine Goldauszeichnung erhielt. Die DVD wurde erstmals von Edel Music herausgegeben, nachdem der Vertrag von Müller-Westernhagen mit seinem alten Label Warner nach 32 Jahren Zusammenarbeit ausgelaufen war und auf beiderseitigen Wunsch nicht verlängert wurde. Unter demselben Titel erschien auch eine limitierte so genannte earBOOK-Ausgabe, die zwei CDs, zwei DVDs und ein großformatiges Buch umfasst. Anlässlich seines 60. Geburtstags gab Westernhagen am 18. Dezember 2008 unter dem Motto Lasst uns leben, lasst uns lieben, lasst uns feiern in der KölnArena ein großes Jubiläumskonzert. Ein Zusatzkonzert fand am Folgetag an gleicher Stelle statt, zwei weitere folgten anschließend in Hamburg und Berlin. Ab 2009 Am 23. Oktober 2009 erschien mit Williamsburg nach über vier Jahren wieder ein Album mit neuen Stücken des Künstlers. Westernhagen hatte es Anfang des Jahres 2009 im gleichnamigen New Yorker Stadtteil mit namhaften amerikanischen Musikern – beispielsweise Larry Campbell, Peter Stroud (Gitarre) oder Andy Newmark und Shawn Pelton (Schlagzeug) – aufgenommen. Veröffentlicht hat er das Album in Eigenregie, gänzlich ohne Plattenfirma. Das Werk, mit dem er an seine Blues-Wurzeln anknüpfte, stieg auf Platz 2 in die Hitparade ein. Im Oktober 2010 startete er in Mannheim seine aus zehn Konzerten bestehende Tournee Westernhagen Live 2010. Die Eintrittskarten kosteten bis zu 95 Euro. Dementsprechend schleppend lief der Vorverkauf. Einige Konzerte waren nur zu 70 % ausgelastet, andere aber ausverkauft. Westernhagen spielte dabei in Hallen von München bis Hamburg. Begleitet wurde er dabei von seiner Band und seiner Background-Sängerin Della Miles. Das Abschlusskonzert fand am 25. Oktober 2010 in der O2 World Hamburg statt. Im Herbst 2011 veröffentlichte Westernhagen ein Live-Album zur Tour 2010, Hottentottenmusik, welches in der Musikkritik überaus großen Zuspruch fand. Ab dem 11. September 2012 fand eine aus neun Konzerten bestehende Tournee statt, die den Künstler erstmals auch nach Österreich und in die Schweiz führte. Am 25. April 2014 veröffentlichte Marius Müller-Westernhagen erstmals seit vier Jahren wieder ein Studioalbum mit dem Namen Alphatier, welches er exklusiv vor Veröffentlichung auf einer kleinen Clubtournee vorgestellt hatte. 2015 folgte dann eine Tour durch die großen Hallen Deutschlands. |
G;|Walther Franz Maria Stennes (* 12. April 1895 in Fürstenberg, Westfalen; † 18. Mai 1989 ebenda) war ein deutscher Politiker und SA-Führer.  Jugend und Erster Weltkrieg Walther Stennes wurde 1895 als Sohn des Amtmannes und Offiziers Felix Stennes geboren. Von seinem zehnten bis fünfzehnten Lebensjahr wurde er in der Kadettenanstalt auf Schloss Bensberg bei Köln erzogen. 1910 wechselte er zur Hauptkadettenanstalt Berlin-Lichterfelde, wo unter anderem Hermann Göring und Gerhard Roßbach zu seinen Mitschülern zählten. Nachdem Stennes im Sommer 1913 sein Abitur abgelegt hatte, wurde er zur Kriegsschule versetzt. Im August 1914, bei Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges, erhielt er sein Offizierspatent und rückte als Leutnant mit dem 3. Westfälischen Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 16 nach Belgien ein. Am 23. August wurde er verwundet. In Flandern erlebte er den sogenannten Weihnachtsfrieden von 1914 mit, bei dem sich deutsche und britische Frontsoldaten miteinander verbrüderten, um gemeinsam Weihnachten zu feiern. Während des Krieges wurde er mehrfach ausgezeichnet: Im Mai 1915 wurde er mit dem Eisernen Kreuz I. Klasse und im Juni 1917 mit dem Ritterkreuz des Hauses Hohenzollern ausgezeichnet. 1918 erhielt er das Lippische Kriegsverdienstkreuz, das Hanseatenkreuz und das Verwundetenabzeichen in Silber. Freikorps, Sicherheitspolizei und Schwarze Reichswehr (1919 bis 1928) Im Dezember 1918 wurde Walther Stennes als Oberleutnant aus dem Heer verabschiedet. Auf Anregung von Ewald von Kleist stellte er die „Freiwillige Kompanie Stennes“, ein Freikorps, das sich aus vielen ehemaligen Soldaten des Infanterieregiments Nr. 16 zusammensetzte, auf. Es wurde heimlich auf Schloss Varlar bei Coesfeld ausgebildet. Daraus entstand das etwa fünfhundert Mann umfassende Freikorps Hacketau. Mit diesem ging er gegen Erhebungen und Streiks von Arbeitern in Coesfeld, Dülmen, Bocholt, Münster und Düsseldorf vor. In Hamm konnte er einen Arbeiterstreik sogar gänzlich unterdrücken. Während der Bürgerkriegskämpfe um das Ruhrgebiet im März 1919 wurde Stennes vom kommandierenden General von Watter als Militärbefehlshaber in Hamm Stadt und Land eingesetzt. Sein Freikorps besetzte rund um Hamm die Zechen Radbod, de Wendel, Sachsen und Westfalen. Die bestreikte Zeche Radbod wurde von der Truppe notdürftig in Betrieb gehalten und so auch die Gasversorgung der Stadt Münster gesichert. Am 19. Juli 1919 wurde Stennes in die Sicherheitspolizei beim Polizeipräsidium Berlin eingestellt: Am 1. August 1919 erhielt er das Kommando über eine Hundertschaft zur besonderen Verwendung (z.b.V.) der Berliner Sicherheitspolizei, deren spezielle Aufgabe der Schutz des Regierungsviertels und die Bewachung der Regierung bei Bürgerkrieg und Unruhen sein sollte. Während des Kapp-Putsches im März 1920 erwies die Hundertschaft z.b.V. sich jedoch gegenüber der republikanischen Regierung als wenig loyal: Anstatt die Regierung zu verteidigen, lief sie zu den Putschisten über und versah sogar gemeinsam mit Soldaten der Marine-Brigade Ehrhardt Wachdienst in Charlottenburg, wobei sie das Abzeichen des rechtsradikalen „Bundes nationalgesinnter Soldaten“ trug. Dennoch wurde Stennes am 12. Juni 1920 zum Polizeihauptmann befördert. Nachdem Stennes am 22. August 1921 von der Führung der Hundertschaft z.b.V. entbunden worden war, wurde er am 1. Dezember 1921 in die innere Dienststelle des Abteilungskommandos versetzt und zum 1. Januar 1922 in den Stab der Polizeiabteilung Zehlendorf abgeordnet. Bald danach, am 28. Februar 1922, schied er auf eigenen Wunsch ganz aus dem Polizeidienst aus. In späteren Jahren kursierten zahlreiche Gerüchte um Stennes’ Tätigkeit bei der Sicherheitspolizei: So soll er innerhalb der Hundertschaft eine Sondertruppe namens „Ringmannen“ ins Leben gerufen haben, die Fememorde verübte und Putschpläne gegen die Republik vorbereitete. Insbesondere der mysteriöse Tod des Wachtmeisters Buchholz, des Kassengeschäftsführers der Hundertschaft, im Jahr 1920 wurde von der Presse immer wieder den Ringmannen angelastet und darauf zurückgeführt, dass dieser Waffenschiebereien entdeckt habe und im Begriff gewesen sei, diese offenzulegen. Im Herbst 1922 schloss sich Stennes der „Schwarzen Reichswehr“ an. Als Kommandant des Forts Hahneberg leitete er die illegale militärische Ausbildung junger Männer aus den verschiedenen nationalistischen Verbänden. Im Oktober 1923 beteiligte sich Stennes am Küstriner Putsch der „Schwarzen Reichswehr“. Es mussten erst schwere Polizei- und Reichswehreinheiten aufgezogen werden, um Stennes zur Aufgabe des Forts Hahneberg zu bewegen, wo er sich mit seinen schwer bewaffneten Aufständischen verschanzt hatte. 1924 kehrte Stennes vorübergehend in die Privatwirtschaft zurück: Mit der Abfindung für seine Pension eröffnete er in Tempelhof ein Kraftdroschken-Unternehmen, das jedoch fehlschlug. Im weiteren Verlauf der 1920er Jahre wurden Stennes weiterhin Beteiligung an Verschwörungen gegen die Republik, Verwicklung in Fememorde und Waffenschiebereien sowie Attentatspläne – vor allem gegen sozialdemokratische Politiker – nachgesagt: Allerdings konnte keine dieser Anschuldigungen bewiesen werden. Hausdurchsuchungen bei ihm und bei seinen Anhängern in den Jahren 1925 bis 1928 verliefen stets ergebnislos. In seiner widersprüchlichen Doppelrolle als Offizier der Sicherheitspolizei und gleichzeitiger Gegner der Weimarer Republik knüpfte Stennes bis um 1925 zahlreiche Kontakte, was ihn bald zu einem der bestvernetzten Männer auf Seiten der politischen Rechten machte. Einerseits arbeitete er mit Außenminister Gustav Stresemann eng zusammen, gleichzeitig stand er aber auch in ständiger Fühlung mit Republikgegnern wie Waldemar Pabst, mit dem er seit 1920 befreundet war. Den Großteil seiner politischen Beziehungen unterhielt Stennes allerdings zu Kampfbundführern sowie zu Nachrichtenmännern wie Hanns Reinholz oder Herbert von Bose, dem Ehemann seiner Cousine Thea Kühne. Auch Adolf Hitler hatte Stennes bereits 1920 – über Erich Ludendorff – kennengelernt. Hitlers Angebot, die Führung über die Sturmabteilung (SA), die Kampfformation der NS-Bewegung, zu übernehmen, lehnte er 1922 jedoch ab. Stattdessen wurde der Fliegerhauptmann Hermann Göring erster Führer der SA. SA-Führer (1928 bis 1931) Im Mai 1927 schloss Stennes sich den Nationalsozialisten an. Er übernahm zunächst die Führung der SA im Gau Berlin. Am 30. September 1927 folgte die Ernennung zum OSAF-Ost, d. h. zum regionalen Oberbefehlshaber der SA in Ostdeutschland, mit deren Ausbau er betraut wurde: In dieser Eigenschaft unterstanden ihm die SA-Einheiten von Berlin, Brandenburg, Ostpreußen und Pommern, die gut ein Drittel der gesamten SA ausmachten. Außerdem war Stennes seit dieser Zeit Stellvertreter von Franz Pfeffer von Salomon, dem Stabschef der SA als Gesamtorganisation. Anlässlich der Reichstagswahl 1930 forderte Stennes von Hitler nachdrücklich eine stärkere Berücksichtigung von SA-Führern auf sicheren Listenplätzen, was jedoch keine Berücksichtigung fand. Eine weitere Verschlechterung der Beziehungen Stennes’ zu Hitler und der NSDAP ergab sich in der Folgezeit zum einen aus der materiellen Not, die in weiten Kreisen der SA herrschte, und zum zweiten aus immer klarer werdenden grundsätzlichen taktischen Differenzen: Während Stennes auf eine Regierungsübernahme durch einen gewaltsamen Staatsstreich der SA drängte, hatte Hitler sich seit dem Scheitern seines Putsches von 1923 darauf festgelegt, ausschließlich auf legalem Wege über die Gewinnung der Parlamentsmehrheit bei Wahlen zur Macht zu gelangen. Eine Reihe von Forderungen, die Stennes an Hitler richtete (SA-Männer in größerem Umfang auf die Reichstagskandidatenliste der NSDAP zu setzen, Bezahlung von SA-Wachen für Saalwächterdienste usw.), wies dieser rundherum zurück. Stennes reagierte darauf, indem er am 30. August 1930 die Berliner Hauptgeschäftsstelle der NSDAP und die Redaktion der Berliner Parteizeitung Der Angriff von seinen SA-Leuten besetzen ließ (sogenannte erste Stennes-Meuterei). Die SS-Wachen wurden bei dieser Gelegenheit zusammengeschlagen. Gauleiter Joseph Goebbels, gerade in Breslau, rief Hitler zu Hilfe und eilte selbst nach Berlin zurück. Hitler, der nur mit Mühe Stennes zu einem vorläufigen Einlenken bewegen konnte, setzte anschließend Pfeffer von Salomon, der sich unfähig gezeigt hatte, Stennes in Zaum zu halten, als Stabschef der SA ab und berief an seiner Stelle Ernst Röhm. Ferner wurde eine verschärfte Beobachtung und Bespitzelung von Stennes veranlasst, so durch den Hitler-treuen Arzt Leonardo Conti, der der Berliner SA als Stabsarzt zugeteilt war. 1931 eskalierten die Konflikte von Stennes mit der Parteileitung im sogenannten Stennes-Putsch: Einem Befehl Hitlers vom 20. Februar 1931, der verlangte, dass die Berliner SA sich vorläufig einer Notverordnung der Regierung Brüning fügen und an keinen Straßenkämpfen mehr beteiligen sollte, handelte Stennes offen zuwider. Hitler sah dadurch seinen Legalitätskurs massiv gefährdet, bis hin zu der Möglichkeit eines erneuten Parteiverbotes. So wurde Stennes am 31. März 1931 durch Hitler und Röhm von seinem Posten als OSAF-Ost abberufen und in die Münchner Parteizentrale versetzt, was praktisch einer Degradierung gleichkam. Stennes entschied sich dazu, sich seiner Absetzung gewaltsam zu widersetzen: Am 1. April ließ er die Geschäftsstelle der Partei und die Redaktion des Angriffs von seinen Anhängern besetzen, in der Hoffnung, so die NS-Bewegung zu spalten und das Gros der SA auf seinen Kurs einzuschwenken. Die Nummer des Angriffs vom Folgetag brachte er selbst heraus. Die Entsetzung der Räumlichkeiten konnte erst mit Hilfe der Berliner Polizei erreicht werden. In den folgenden Wochen trat Stennes dann öffentlich als Werberedner in eigener Sache in Erscheinung: Er rechtfertigte seine Handlungen, indem er die Verschwendungssucht und das Bonzentum der Parteiführer sowie den Verrat an den sozialistischen Prinzipien des Parteiprogramms der NSDAP anprangerte. Obwohl er mit Parolen wie „Was ist wichtiger: Stiefelsohlen für die SA oder ein Palais für die Parteibonzen?“ starken Widerhall fand, konnte Stennes nur etwa ein Drittel der Berliner SA zum offenen Aufstand gegen Hitler bewegen. Hitler ließ Stennes unverzüglich als Chef der Berliner SA absetzen. Praktisch wurde seine Macht durch den kommissarischen Berliner SA-Chef Paul Schulz, den Berliner SS-Führer Kurt Daluege und durch Edmund Heines gebrochen. Stennes erklärte später, dass wenn Charisma eine Rolle bei der Niederschlagung seiner Revolte gespielt habe, es Schulz’ Charisma und nicht das Hitlers gewesen sei. In der Folgezeit wurden sämtliche Sympathisanten von Stennes aus der NSDAP ausgeschlossen. Stennes gründete stattdessen die Nationalsozialistische Kampfbewegung Deutschlands (NSKD). Politischer Rivale der NSDAP (1931 bis 1933) Politisch kämpfte Stennes in der Folgezeit bis 1933 gegen die NSDAP. So engagierte er sich in den Wahlkämpfen des Jahres 1932 gegen die Partei und bot noch Ende 1932 dem damaligen Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher an, ihm seine Organisation in einem erneuten Wahlkampf zur Auseinandersetzung mit der NSDAP zur Verfügung zu stellen. Enge Kontakte pflegte Stennes, trotz erheblicher inhaltlicher Differenzen, außerdem mit Otto Strasser und anderen „abtrünnigen Nazis“, die sich nach ihrem Ausscheiden aus der NS-Bewegung gegen diese wandten. Stennes erklärte später, sein Interesse habe immer nur der SA und nie der Partei gegolten. Hitlers Legalitätskurs, der darauf abzielte, die Macht im Staat mit Hilfe einer Partei innerhalb des vorgegebenen politischen Systems zu erringen, lehnte er ab. Stattdessen erstrebte er einen Umbau auf der Grundlage einer populären Volksbewegung und ohne Partei, die er als Konzession an das bestehende System ansah. Als die preußische Staatsregierung im April 1932 einen Sonderfonds zum Schutze der Demokratie beschloss, wirkte ihr Finanzminister Otto Klepper auch auf die Unterstützung der „Schwarzen Front“ hin, insbesondere jene Walther Stennes’. In den Tagen vor dem „Preußenschlag“ wurde er von Klepper zu einer Besprechung mit Heinrich Hirtsiefer und Carl Severing mitgebracht und wusste aus dem Reichswehrministerium die Information zu präsentieren, Franz von Papen sei nach Neudeck gefahren, „um sich von Hindenburg Vollmachten für einen Staatsstreich geben zu lassen“. Als sich die Hinweise verdichtet hatten, machte Klepper drei Tage vor dem Putsch im Ministerium den Vorschlag, Stennes eine Hundertschaft zur besonderen Verwendung anführen zu lassen, die verhaften sollte, wer unbefugt das Ministerium betrat, selbst ein Gegenangriff auf das Reichsoberhaupt schien ihm nötigenfalls legitim. Nur Hirtsiefer unterstützte ihn. Exilzeit (1933 bis 1949) Nach der nationalsozialistischen Machtübernahme im Frühjahr 1933 ging Stennes zusammen mit seiner Frau und Tochter in die Emigration. Die Angaben über die Umstände seiner Flucht/Ausreise unterscheiden sich erheblich: Während Hans Graf von Lehndorff, ein dem konservativen Widerstand nahestehender Arzt aus Ostpreußen, in seinen Memoiren Menschen, Pferde, Weites Land berichtete, dass sein Mentor, der NS-Gegner Carl von Jordans, Stennes in einer „Nacht und Nebel“-Aktion zur Flucht ins Ausland verholfen habe, finden sich in Stennes’ Nachlass im Institut für Zeitgeschichte auch Briefe, die nahelegen, dass Stennes nach einer vorübergehenden Haft – einige Quellen sprechen von vier Monaten Einzelhaft – im Columbiahaus dank der Fürsprache seines Onkels, des Kölner Erzbischofs Kardinal Karl Joseph Schulte, und des Päpstlichen Nuntius Cesare Orsenigo sowie der Protektion Görings freigelassen worden sei. Göring habe ihm das Versprechen abgenommen, das Land sofort zu verlassen und sich nicht in der Schweiz niederzulassen. Stennes emigrierte anschließend über die Niederlande und England nach China. An Bord des Dampfers Ranchi traf Stennes zusammen mit seiner Frau am 19. November in Shanghai ein. In China war Stennes bis 1949 für Chiang Kai-sheks Kuomintang-Bewegung als Militärberater tätig. Seine Bemühungen gingen dahin, die Armee- und Polizeikräfte der chinesischen Nationalisten nach dem Vorbild der preußischen Streitkräfte zu reorganisieren. Außerdem befehligte er die zweitausend Mann starke Leibwache Chiang Kai-sheks. Von deutschen Diplomaten und Geheimdienstlern blieb Stennes während seines Aufenthalts in China unbehelligt. Zum Gestapo-Vertreter in Japan Josef Meisinger pflegte er sogar beinahe freundschaftliche Beziehungen. Dennoch soll Stennes ständig nationalsozialistische Anschläge auf sein Leben befürchtet haben. Mehreren Aufforderungen, nach Deutschland zurückzukehren, die ihn nach Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkrieges erreichten, weigerte er sich Folge zu leisten. Jay Taylor geht sogar davon aus, dass Stennes Beziehungen zu dem sowjetischen Spion an der deutschen Botschaft in Tokio Richard Sorge unterhielt, der ihn 1941 über den bevorstehenden deutschen Angriff auf die Sowjetunion unterrichtet habe. Stennes soll diese Nachricht an Chiang weitergegeben haben, der sie über Zhou Enlai Josef Stalin zugespielt habe. Nach der Besetzung großer Teile Chinas durch Japan entging Stennes nur knapp der Verhaftung. Nach dem Krieg verlangten umgekehrt die Amerikaner kurzzeitig seine Auslieferung, nachdem er sich geweigert hatte, ehemalige Nationalsozialisten in Shanghai zu denunzieren, die mit der japanischen Armee kollaboriert hatten. Chiang Kai-shek bewahrte ihn vor diesem Schicksal, indem er ihn zu einem Mitglied der chinesischen Militärkommission ernannte. Nach seiner Rückkehr nach Deutschland im Jahr 1949 versuchte Stennes sich in der niedersächsischen Landespolitik, wo er für die Landtagswahlen im Mai 1951 die Organisation der Deutschen Sozialen Partei des Landwirtschaftsministers Günther Gereke übernahm. Danach zog Stennes sich ins Privatleben zurück. Er stellte einen Antrag auf Anerkennung als Verfolgter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft, der 1957 vom Bundesgerichtshof abgelehnt wurde. In einer Aussage für das Spruchkammerverfahren hatte Otto Klepper 1949 Stennes’ Dienste als wertvoll und persönlich riskant bezeichnet und dem mit einem Brief vom April 1954 seine Einschätzung zugefügt, es sei bei Stennes eine grundsätzliche Abkehr von der Ideologie des Nationalsozialismus erfolgt. In seinen späteren Jahren lebte er in Brügge, einem Stadtteil von Lüdenscheid. |
G;|Gustav Manker (* 29. März 1913 in Wien; † 7. Juli 1988 ebenda) war ein österreichischer Regisseur, Bühnenbildner und Theaterdirektor. Von 1968 bis 1979 war er der Direktor des Volkstheaters in Wien.  Frühe Jahre Gustav Manker war der Sohn des Ingenieurs Josef Manker von Lerchenstein und der Ludmilla Flesch von Brunningen, einer Cousine des Schriftstellers Hans Flesch-Brunningen. Die Familie Manker wurde 1865 in Gestalt des k.k. Regierungsrats Johann Manker mit dem Prädikat von Lerchenstein in den österreichischen Adelsstand erhoben. Mankers Großmutter entstammte der Familie Kaler zu Lanzenheim. Manker besuchte das Stiftsgymnasium St. Paul im Kärntner Lavanttal und studierte dann von 1933 bis 1935 bei Max Reinhardt am Max Reinhardt Seminar in Wien Regie und Schauspiel sowie gleichzeitig Bühnenbild bei Alfred Roller und Oskar Strnad. Vorkriegszeit In seiner Studienzeit wirkte er bei den Salzburger Festspielen in Reinhardts Inszenierungen von Jedermann und Faust mit. 1935 erhielt er sein erstes Engagement bei Ernst Lönner am Avantgardetheater „Kleinen Theater in der Praterstraße“ in Wien, wo er u. a. 1935 die österreichische Erstaufführung von Ödön von Horváths Kasimir und Karoline ausstattete. 1937 arbeitete er bei Elias Jubal am Kellertheater „Theater für 49“ in Wien. Von 1936 bis 1938 war Manker Bühnenbildner und Schauspieler am deutschsprachigen Stadttheater in Bielsko-Bielitz in Polen. 1938 wurde er als Bühnenbildner ans Deutsche Volkstheater in Wien engagiert, an dem er mehr als vierzig Jahre arbeitete, ab 1942 auch als Regisseur, danach als Ausstattungsleiter und Oberspielleiter, und von 1968 bis 1979 als dessen Direktor. Manker war die prägende Figur dieses Hauses, er inszenierte dort insgesamt 155 Stücke und entwarf für 207 Produktionen die Bühnenbilder. NS-Zeit 1938 entwarf Manker am Deutschen Volkstheater die Ausstattung zur Eröffnungspremiere von Friedrich Schillers Die Räuber in der Regie des Intendanten Walter Bruno Iltz. Es folgten über vierzig weitere bis zur Schließung des Theaters im Zuge der allgemeinen Theatersperre 1944, darunter Klassiker wie Ein Sommernachtstraum, Die Jungfrau von Orléans, König Ottokars Glück und Ende, Der Richter von Zalamea, Ein treuer Diener seines Herrn, Maria Stuart, Hamlet, Tendenz- und NS-Historiendramen von Hans Rehberg und Otto Emmerich Groh bis zu Dramen von Ludwig Anzengruber (Der Meineidbauer), Richard Billinger (Der Gigant) und Karl Schönherr (Glaube und Heimat) sowie österreichische Klassiker wie Johann Nestroys Der Zerrissene und Ferdinand Raimunds Der Bauer als Millionär und Der Diamant des Geisterkönigs. In diese Jahre fielen erste Arbeiten mit den Regisseuren Leon Epp und Günther Haenel, die zu Mankers wichtigsten künstlerischen Partnern werden sollten. Aufführungen wie G.B. Shaws Die heilige Johanna (1943) und Ferdinand Raimunds Der Diamant des Geisterkönigs (1944), beide in der Regie von Günther Haenel und in Bühnenbildern von Manker formulierten für aufmerksame Zuschauer einen erkennbaren theatralischen Widerstand. Die Arbeit an der „heiligen Johanna“ bedeutete für Manker einen entscheidenden Schritt zur Erreichung eines modernen Theaterstils. Er verzichtete auf jegliche Illusion und schuf eine völlig abstrakte Szenerie. Die Darstellung der Johanna durch die erst 19-jährige Inge Konradi wurde allgemein gerühmt, das puristische Bühnenbild Mankers aber wurde vom Völkischen Beobachter angegriffen, da es nicht konform ging mit dem NS-Anspruch nach totaler Illusion. Bei Der Diamant des Geisterkönigs kam es 1944 zu einer deutlichen Demonstration theatralischen Widerstandes: Nikolaus Haenels Inszenierung von Raimunds Zaubermärchen siedelte das „Land der Wahrheit“ stilistisch im Nazi-Deutschland der Gegenwart an, Mankers Bühnenbild parodierte die monumentale NS-Ästhetik mit Statuen im Stile Arno Brekers, ironisierte auch den deutschen Reichsadler, der dem Publikum sein Hinterteil zuwendete, und paraphrasierte das Symbol des Kraft durch Freude-Rades am Eingang zum Palast des Königs. Die Kostüme waren Anlehnungen an die Hitlerjugend und den Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM), die Tochter des Königs und ihre Freundinnen traten mit Mittelscheitel und langen blonden Zöpfen als BDM-Mädchen auf. Karl Kalwoda, der Darsteller des König Veritatius, sprach in abgehackten Sätzen und lieferte in Gestik und Haltung eine Hitler-Parodie. Für die Ballonfahrt aus dem Land der Wahrheit wurde am Ende der Szene der beziehungsreiche Satz „Die Zukunft liegt in der Luft!“ hinzugefügt. Neben seiner Arbeit am Deutschen Volkstheater, an dem er ab 1942 aufgrund der Kriegssituation der einzige Bühnenbilder war, entwarf Manker auch Bühnenbilder für die Komödie in der Johannesgasse unter der Direktion von Leon Epp und die Exl-Bühne sowie für die Wiener Kammerspiele, das Bürgertheater und das Renaissancetheater. Mankers erste Regiearbeit war im Dezember 1942 Der getreue Johannes von Walter Hans Boese nach den Gebrüdern Grimm, eine Aufführung des Deutschen Volkstheaters in der „Komödie“ in der Johannesgasse. Durch die Intervention der Widerstandsgruppe „Hornik“ wurde Manker vor dem Kriegsdienst bewahrt und lernte im Luftschutzkeller den jungen Helmut Qualtinger kennen, mit dem ihn eine künstlerische Lebensfreundschaft verband. Nachkriegszeit Im Mai 1945 wurde Manker kurzfristig Mitglied der kommunistischen Partei. Erste Arbeiten am Theater waren die Bühnenbilder für die Erstaufführung der vier letzten, apokalyptischen Szenen Die letzte Nacht, dem Epilog zur Tragödie Die letzten Tage der Menschheit von Karl Kraus. In der Direktionszeit Günther Haenels am Volkstheater stattete Manker u. a. den Theaterskandal Haben von Julius Hay aus, Anatoli Lunatscharskis Der befreite Don Quijote, Jean Anouilhs Antigone, Eugene O’Neills Verwirrung der Jugend (mit dem jungen Oskar Werner) – meist in der Regie Günther Haenels. Zugleich arbeitete er an Leon Epps Die Insel, an den Kammerspielen (Erstaufführungen von Franz Werfels Jacobowsky und der Oberst, 1946, und von Jean-Paul Sartres Die Fliegen), 1948 am Bürgertheater, an der Renaissance-Bühne und am Theater in der Josefstadt. Mit Ben Jonsons Volpone begann im Januar 1946 Mankers eigentliche Regiekarriere. Es folgten J. B. Priestleys Gefährliche Wahrheit und Ferdinand Bruckners Heroische Komödie. 1947 inszenierte Manker am Wiener Volkstheater sein erstes Stück von Johann Nestroy, Kampl mit Karl Skraup. Nestroy, von dem er insgesamt 43 Stücke inszenierte, wurde zum bestimmenden Autor seines Lebens. Mit seinen Aufführungen gelang es Manker, einen neuen Nestroy-Stil zu entwickeln, der den Stücken – auch hinsichtlich der Ausstattung – jede biedermeierliche Färbung nahm, diesen vielmehr intellektuell zugespitzt präsentierte, auf Bearbeitungen und Zusätze verzichtete. 1948 inszenierte Manker, erstmals auch im eigenen Bühnenbild, Nestroys Zu ebener Erde und erster Stock; eine Arbeitsweise, der er lange Jahre treu blieb. Es folgte Der Talisman (1951, mit Hans Putz und Inge Konradi) sowie Der Bauer als Millionär (1948) und Der Verschwender (1949) von Ferdinand Raimund, jeweils mit Paul Hörbiger in der Hauptrolle und in der Choreographie von Rosalia Chladek. 1948 wechselte Günther Haenel an die neu gegründete Scala. Manker konnte deren Angebot nicht folgen und blieb am Volkstheater, wo es im Dezember 1948 bei der Erstaufführung von Ödön von Horváths Geschichten aus dem Wiener Wald zu einem der größten Theaterskandale der Nachkriegszeit kam. Die wichtigsten Regie-Arbeiten Mankers in dieser Zeit waren 1949 Jacques Offenbachs Die schöne Helena in einer Wiener Dialektfassung (mit Christl Mardayn, Fritz Imhoff, Inge Konradi und Karl Skraup in einem surrealistischen Bühnenbild von Stephan Hlawa), 1951 Georg Kaisers Napoleon in New Orleans, die Erstaufführung von Albert Camus’ Die Gerechten, Vicky Baums Menschen im Hotel sowie 1952 Franz Werfels Juarez und Maximilian, meist im eigenen Bühnenbild. Direktion Leon Epp Während der Direktion von Leon Epp (1952–1968) war Manker der entscheidende Regisseur am Wiener Volkstheater, Chefbühnenbildner und Oberspielleiter. Besonders Schillers Die Räuber waren auf einer zweigeteilten Simultanbühne in Regie und Bühnenbild von Manker 1959 bahnbrechend. 1963 wagte sich das Volkstheater mit Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder an ein Stück von Bertolt Brecht, nachdem dieser vor dem Hintergrund des Kalten Krieges in Österreich durch den so genannten Brecht-Boykott zuvor unaufgeführt geblieben war. Die Presse sprach von der „Blockadebrecher“-Premiere am 23. Februar 1963 mit Dorothea Neff, Fritz Muliar und Ulrich Wildgruber unter der Regie von Manker, der in Folge auch Der kaukasische Kreidekreis (1964), Die heilige Johanna der Schlachthöfe (1965) und Der gute Mensch von Sezuan (1968) inszenierte und damit ein Umdenken in Bezug an Brechts Stücke auf österreichischen Bühnen in Gang setzte. Wichtige Inszenierungen Mankers in dieser Zeit waren die Erstaufführungen von Albert Camus' Der Belagerungszustand (1953), Ein Dorf ohne Männer von Ödön von Horváth (1954), Der Eismann kommt von Eugene O’Neill (1955) und Die Chinesische Mauer von Max Frisch (1956), Sonnenfinsternis von Sidney Kingsley (nach dem Roman von Arthur Koestler, 1957), Der Teufel und der liebe Gott von Jean-Paul Sartre, die Erstaufführung von Blick zurück im Zorn von John Osborne (1958), die Uraufführung von Franz Grillparzers Blanka von Kastilien (1959), Dantons Tod von Georg Büchner (1960), Troilus und Cressida von William Shakespeare (mit Michael Heltau und Elfriede Irrall) sowie ein Frank Wedekind-Zyklus mit Lulu, Frühlings Erwachen, Musik, Der Marquis von Keith und König Nicolo sowie Ferdinand Bruckners Die Verbrecher (1963) auf einer 7-geteilten Simultanbühne. Neben seiner Arbeit am Volkstheater fand Manker auch Zeit, mit Berthold Viertel am Burg- und Akademietheater zu arbeiten, sowie am Theater in der Josefstadt und an den Kammerspielen zu inszenieren. Als Theaterdirektor entdeckte er Anfang der 1970er Jahre mit Wolfgang Bauer und Peter Turrini eine neue Generation österreichischer Dramatiker. Manker inszenierte mit Vorliebe Stücke des Alt-Wiener Volkstheaters, die durch das organische Zusammenwirken seiner Bühnenbilder und seiner Regie einen neuen Aufführungsstil für dieses Genre prägten. Legendär sind seine Nestroy-Aufführungen mit Protagonisten wie Karl Skraup, Hans Putz, Walter Kohut, Fritz Muliar, Karl Paryla, Heinz Petters und Helmut Qualtinger. Besonders die österreichischen Volksstücke von Johann Nestroy, Ferdinand Raimund und Ludwig Anzengruber waren Manker ein Anliegen, für das er mit Karl Skraup, Hans Putz, Hugo Gottschlich, Fritz Muliar, Walter Kohut, Kurt Sowinetz und Hilde Sochor ein erstklassiges Ensemble zur Verfügung hatte. Manker inszenierte auch viele unbekannte Stücke von Nestroy, wie Eine Wohnung ist zu vermieten in Stadt, eine Wohnung ist zu verlassen in Vorstadt, eine Wohnung mit Garten ist zu haben in Hietzing (1962) mit Qualtinger, Liebesg'schichten und Heiratssachen (1964), Das Haus der Temperamente (1965, mit Karl Paryla), und Zu ebener Erde und erster Stock (1967, mit Heinz Petters). Auch die österreichische Moderne von Schnitzler bis Horváth, Ferdinand Bruckner und Ferenc Molnár sowie die Uraufführung von Helmut Qualtingers Die Hinrichtung (1965) lagen in Mankers Händen. Außerdem war Qualtinger in Dostojewskis Schuld und Sühne als Untersuchungsrichter und als Zauberkönig in Horváths Geschichten aus dem Wiener Wald (1968) zu sehen. Direktor des Volkstheaters Gustav Manker übernahm nach dem Unfalltod von Leon Epp 1968 die Direktion des Volkstheaters. Zu den Marksteinen seiner Direktion gehörte vor allem die Entdeckung junger österreichischer Dramatiker. Im Jahr 1969 hatte Change von Wolfgang Bauer Premiere und 1971 dessen Silvester oder das Massaker im Hotel Sacher (mit Qualtinger) in der Regie von Bernd Fischerauer, 1971 wurde Rozznjogd von Peter Turrini uraufgeführt und danach auch dessen Stücke Sauschlachten (1972), Der tollste Tag (1973) und Die Wirtin (1975). Weitere junge Autoren waren Gerhard Roth (Lichtenberg, 1974), Wilhelm Pevny (Sprintorgasmik), Herwig Seeböck (Haushalt oder Die Sandhasen), Wilhelm Pellert (Jesus von Ottakring, 1974), Walter Wippersberg (Was haben vom Leben, 1976), Harald Sommer (Ich betone, daß ich nicht das geringste an der Regierung auszusetzen habe), Winfried Bruckner (Vergewaltigt am Abend, 1978) und Helmut Zenker (Wahnsinnig glücklich, 1976). Manker legte generell ein großes Augenmerk auf die Pflege österreichischer Literatur, von Raimund bis Anzengruber, von Schnitzler bis Horváth, Csokor, Karl Schönherr, Lernet-Holenia, Wildgans, Herzmanovsky-Orlando, Ferdinand Bruckner und Hermann Bahr, dessen Stücke Das Konzert und Wienerinnen zu Publikumsrennern wurden. 1971 kam es sogar zur Uraufführung eines nachgelassenen Stückes von Arthur Schnitzler, Zug der Schatten, nachdem schon ein Zyklus dessen früher Werke Freiwild, Das Märchen und Anatol aufgeführt worden war. Mankers ambitionierte Klassikerpflege umfasste Grillparzer ebenso wie Shakespeare – 1970 kam es zur umjubelten Erstaufführung von William Shakespeares Hamlet 163 mit Michael Heltau – und gipfelte in Richard Beer-Hofmanns Einrichtung von Goethes Faust I und II an einem Abend. Helmut Qualtinger trat weiterhin unter der Direktion Manker des Öfteren auf, so etwa 1969 in Der Talisman von Johann Nestroy. Legendär waren Mankers jährliche Nestroy-Inszenierungen, die neben viel gespielten Stücken auch Unbekanntes ausgruben und mit einem eingespielten „Nestroy-Ensemble“ (bestehend aus Heinz Petters, Herbert Propst, Rudolf Strobl, Walter Langer, Hilde Sochor, Dolores Schmidinger und Brigitte Swoboda) durch seinen speziellen Stil („Nestroy pur“) zu Publikumshits wurden: Der Talisman (1969), Heimliches Geld, heimliche Liebe (1972), Das Gewürzkrämerkleeblatt (1972), Gegen Torheit gibt es kein Mittel (1973), Umsonst! (1974), Einen Jux will er sich machen (1976), Lumpazivagabundus (1977), Höllenangst (1977), Frühere Verhältnisse und Die schlimmen Buben in der Schule (1978). Manker inszenierte auch bei den Salzburger Festspielen (Der Unbestechliche) und den Bregenzer Festspielen, am Schauspielhaus Zürich, in der Komödie Basel, am Residenztheater München (Johann Nestroys Der Zerrissene), am Theater am Kurfürstendamm Berlin, dem Thalia Theater Hamburg (Das Haus der Temperamente), dem Württembergischen Staatstheater Stuttgart, den Burgfestspielen Jagsthausen oder den Luisenburg-Festspielen in Wunsiedel sowie am Theater in der Josefstadt (u. a. Schillers Don Karlos), am Wiener Akademietheater, an der Wiener Volksoper (Giuseppe Verdis I masnadieri). Er entdeckte und förderte Schauspieler wie Otto Schenk, Ulrich Wildgruber, Fritz Muliar, Michael Heltau, Heinz Petters, Walter Langer, Karlheinz Hackl, Dolores Schmidinger, Kitty Speiser, Brigitte Swoboda, Herwig Seeböck, Franz Morak und Almut Zilcher. Rezeption und Würdigung Manker war ein „von der Schauspielkunst faszinierter, vom Theater nahezu manisch Besessener, beseelt mit intellektueller Neugier, introvertiert, scheu, emphatisch und exaltiert“ (Der Standard, 31. Dezember 2010), ein „Renaissance-Mensch des Theaters“ (Fritz Muliar), voll „Können und Vision“ (Michael Heltau) und in den Augen des Autors Peter Turrini eine „merkwürdige Mischung zwischen einem Repräsentanten des öffentlichen Theaters und einem Stierler und Aufmümpfer und Störer“, der als Theaterdirektor „andere stören ließ – oder der die Störerei zuließ“. Über das Theater sagte Manker: „Es ist das Höchste, was es gibt, großartiges Theater zu machen. Das Jämmerlichste, wenn es schlecht ist“. Am 8. Dezember 2006 wurde im Volkstheater ein Porträt Mankers von Johannes Grützke enthüllt. Am 17. März 2013 fand zu seinem 100. Geburtstag eine Matinee im Wiener Volkstheater statt, an der Dolores Schmidinger, Hilde Sochor, Brigitte Swoboda, Karlheinz Hackl, Michael Heltau, Walter Langer, Paulus Manker, Peter Turrini und Andrea Eckert mitwirkten. Privates Gustav Manker war mit der Schauspielerin Hilde Sochor verheiratet und ist Vater der Schauspielerin Katharina Scholz-Manker (* 1956), des Schauspielers und Regisseurs Paulus Manker (* 1958) und der Ärztin Magdalena Manker (* 1967). |
G;|Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (* 24. September 1896 in St. Paul, Minnesota; † 21. Dezember 1940 in Hollywood, Los Angeles) war ein US-amerikanischer Schriftsteller. Sein erster Roman This Side of Paradise (Diesseits vom Paradies), den er als 23-Jähriger Ende März 1920 veröffentlichte, machte ihn in kurzer Zeit berühmt. Gemeinsam mit seiner Frau Zelda Sayre führte er in den 1920er Jahren ein exzessives Leben. Das Ehepaar wurde in der US-amerikanischen Öffentlichkeit als typische Vertreter ihrer Generation wahrgenommen. Bereits in den 1930er Jahren war F. Scott Fitzgerald jedoch weitgehend in Vergessenheit geraten. Dazu trugen auch sein Alkoholismus und die psychische Erkrankung seiner Frau bei. F. Scott Fitzgerald starb 1940 im Alter von nur 44 Jahren in der Überzeugung, sein Lebensziel verfehlt zu haben, sich als bedeutender Autor seiner Zeit zu beweisen. Fitzgerald wurde als Autor ab den 1940er Jahren wiederentdeckt und wird heute zu den wesentlichen US-amerikanischen Autoren des 20. Jahrhunderts gezählt. Als seine zwei wichtigsten Romane gelten The Great Gatsby (Der große Gatsby, 1925) und Tender is the Night (Zärtlich ist die Nacht, 1934). Der große Gatsby wird dabei als eines der bedeutendsten Werke der amerikanischen Moderne eingeordnet. T. S. Eliot bezeichnete diesen Roman als den ersten Entwicklungsschritt, den der Amerikanische Roman seit Henry James gemacht habe. Fitzgerald setzt sich darin mit Themen wie Dekadenz, Ausschweifungen, Idealismus, Widerstand gegen Veränderungen und sozialen Umbrüchen auseinander. Er schuf dabei ein treffendes Porträt der sogenannten „Roaring Twenties“, den von wirtschaftlichem Wachstum, Prohibition, Kriminalität, Jazz und Flappern geprägten 1920er Jahren in den Vereinigten Staaten.  Jugend Francis Scott Fitzgerald wurde als Sohn von Edward Fitzgerald und dessen Ehefrau Molly (geb. McQuillan) in St. Paul im US-amerikanischen Bundesstaat Minnesota geboren. Er war das dritte Kind des Ehepaars, seine beiden älteren Schwestern waren drei Monate vor seiner Geburt noch im Kleinkindalter verstorben. Eine weitere Schwester, die 1900 geboren wurde, lebte nur eine Stunde. Seine einzig überlebende Schwester, Annabel, kam 1901 zur Welt. Seinen Vornamen Francis erhielt Fitzgerald zu Ehren seines Urgroßonkels Francis Scott Key, des Dichters der US-amerikanischen Nationalhymne. Beide Elternteile waren gläubige Katholiken. Zum Zeitpunkt von F. Scott Fitzgeralds Geburt besaß sein Vater eine Möbelfabrik, die „American Rattan and Willow Works“. Zwei Jahre später, im April 1898, war der Vater gezwungen, die Firma zu verkaufen. Er nahm eine Stelle als Großhandelskaufmann für Procter & Gamble in Buffalo, New York an. Seine Grundschulzeit verbrachte Fitzgerald entsprechend an zwei katholischen Schulen im Osten der USA. Im Juli 1908 verlor der mittlerweile 55-jährige Edward Fitzgerald seine Anstellung. F. Scott Fitzgerald schrieb später über den Tag, an dem man seinem Vater die Entlassung mitteilte: Die Familie kehrte nach der Entlassung des Vaters nach St. Paul, Minnesota im Mittleren Westen zurück. Sie lebten von da an von dem Einkommen, das das Vermögen der Mutter abwarf. Dieses Einkommen war hinreichend hoch, um ihnen den komfortablen Lebensstil von Angehörigen der oberen Mittelschicht zu ermöglichen. Sie lebten in St. Paul in einem Stadtteil, der von sehr wohlhabenden Familien bewohnt wurde. Der berühmteste unter ihnen war James J. Hill, ein Eisenbahnindustrieller, der unter anderem in Fitzgeralds späterem Roman The Great Gatsby erwähnt wird. Fitzgerald besuchte in St. Paul ab 1908 die St. Paul Academy, wo er bereits als Verfasser von Theaterstücken, Liedern und Gedichten auffiel. Seine erste Kurzgeschichte, die Detektivgeschichte The Mystery of the Raymond Mortgage, erschien im Schulmagazin 1909. Fitzgerald war zu diesem Zeitpunkt 13 Jahre alt. Die schulischen Leistungen ließen insgesamt jedoch zu wünschen übrig, so dass seine Eltern entschieden, ihn auf das renommierte katholische Internat Newman School in Hackensack, New Jersey zu senden. Auch hier reüssierte Fitzgerald weniger durch seine schulischen Leistungen, als durch die Geschichten, die er im Schulmagazin publizierte. Er fand wenig sozialen Anschluss an dieser Schule, freundete sich jedoch mit Father Cyril Sigourney Webster Fay an, der ihm später als Vorbild des Monsignor Darcy in seinem ersten Roman This Side of Paradise dienen sollte. Studium und Militärdienst Im September 1913 begann Fitzgerald an der Princeton University zu studieren, einer renommierten, zur sogenannten Ivy League zählenden Universität in New Jersey. Princeton war allerdings nicht seine erste Wahl; Fitzgerald wäre lieber nach Yale gegangen. Fitzgerald, der nur knapp das Aufnahme-Examen in Princeton bestanden hatte, war auch hier akademisch nicht erfolgreich. Sein Studium an der Princeton University schloss er letztlich nie ab. Er traf an der Princeton University allerdings Edmund Wilson und John Peale Bishop, die wesentlich für seine literarische Entwicklung waren. John Peale Bishop machte ihn mit der Dichtkunst vertraut. Wilson, der zu einem der führenden US-amerikanischen Literaturkritiker wurde und mit dem Fitzgerald eine lang anhaltende Freundschaft verbinden sollte, entwickelte sich nach Fitzgeralds eigenen Angaben, zu seinem „intellektuellen Gewissen“. In Princeton wurde Fitzgerald jedoch auch damit konfrontiert, dass die US-amerikanische Gesellschaft keineswegs klassenlos war, sondern gesellschaftliche Schichten nach Religionszugehörigkeit, wirtschaftlichem Erfolg, sowie sozialer und regionaler Herkunft unterschied. Ab Dezember 1914 begann Fitzgerald eine Beziehung zu Ginevra King, einer jungen, wohlhabenden Frau aus St. Pauls oberer Gesellschaftsschicht. Die Beziehung endete im Januar 1917. Das Ende der Beziehung war für Fitzgerald auch Beleg für sein intuitives Gefühl, dass soziale und finanzielle Barrieren es verhinderten, dass arme Jungen reiche Mädchen heirateten. Am 6. April 1917 traten die Vereinigten Staaten in den Ersten Weltkrieg ein. Im Mai 1917 meldete Fitzgerald sich bei der United States Army und wurde im Rang eines Unterleutnants angenommen. Zu seinem lebenslangen Bedauern wurde er jedoch nie auf die Kriegsschauplätze in Europa entsendet, sondern tat an verschiedenen Militärstandorten in den USA Dienst. Im November 1917, während er in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas stationiert war, begann er am ersten Entwurf seines semi-autobiografischen Romans The Romantic Egotist zu arbeiten. Für seinen weiteren Lebensweg war die Versetzung an eine Militärbasis in Montgomery, Alabama entscheidend. Hier lernte er im Juli 1918 die im Jahre 1900 geborene Zelda Sayre kennen. Fitzgerald war sofort in Zelda Sayre verliebt, strittig ist unter den Biografen Fitzgeralds, ob Zelda Sayre für ihren späteren Mann von Beginn an ähnlich intensive Gefühle empfand. Bereits im November 1918 wollte er Zelda heiraten. Da es zu dem Zeitpunkt jedoch zweifelhaft war, ob Fitzgerald in der Lage wäre, ausreichend Geld für eine angemessene Lebensführung zu verdienen, lehnte Zelda Sayre eine Ehe mit ihm zunächst ab. Fitzgerald begann darauf hin bei der New Yorker Werbeagentur Barron Collier zu arbeiten und schrieb abends an Kurzgeschichten, Drehbüchern, Sketchen und Gedichten, von denen er hoffte, dass ihr Verkauf ihm Anerkennung und Geld einbringen würde. Es gelang ihm lediglich, für ein Honorar von 30 USD die Kurzgeschichte Babes in the Wood beim Magazin The Smart Set zu platzieren. 122 ablehnende Briefe hatte er dagegen wie einen Fries in seinem Zimmer aufgehängt. Im Juni 1919 beendete Zelda Sayre die Verlobung mit Fitzgerald; im Juli gab er seine Stelle bei Barron Collier auf und kehrte nach St. Paul zurück, um im Haus seiner Eltern seinen Romanentwurf zu überarbeiten. Früher literarischer Erfolg Der Verlag Scribner’s hatte Interesse an Fitzgeralds frühem Romanmanuskript The Romantic Egotist bekundet, aber sowohl den ersten Entwurf im August 1918 als auch die überarbeitete Fassung im Oktober 1918 abgelehnt. Die dritte Fassung, deren Titel Fitzgerald in This Side of Paradise (Diesseits vom Paradies) änderte, wurde im September 1919 vom Lektor Maxwell Perkins letztlich für Scribner's angenommen. Gleichzeitig gelang es Fitzgerald mehrere Kurzgeschichten zu veröffentlichen. Im Februar 1920 verkaufte er erstmals eine Kurzgeschichte an ein Magazin mit hoher Auflage. The Saturday Evening Post zahlte ihm ein Honorar von 500 USD für seine Kurzgeschichte Head and Shoulders. Bereits mit dem ersten finanziellen Erfolg begann er erneut, um Zelda Sayre zu werben. Im Januar 1920 verlobten sie sich erneut und im April 1920, nur eine Woche nach der Veröffentlichung von Diesseits vom Paradies heirateten Zelda und Scott Fitzgerald in New York City. Diesseits vom Paradies wurde von der Literaturkritik sehr gut besprochen, den Verkaufserfolg bezeichnet Fitzgeralds Biograf Scott Donaldson als nach jedem Maßstab bemerkenswert. Das Porträt der jungen Generation nach dem Ende des Ersten Weltkrieges und insbesondere der Flappers und ihrer emanzipierten Lebensweise machten den erst 23-jährigen Fitzgerald über Nacht berühmt. Fitzgeralds erste Sammlung an Kurzgeschichten Flappers and Philosophers. die im September 1920 erschien, war gleichfalls erfolgreich. Eine wesentliche Einkommensquelle wurde für Fitzgerald jedoch der Verkauf von Kurzgeschichten, Essays und Artikeln. Als Honorar erhielt Fitzgerald für seine Kurzgeschichten jeweils zwischen 1000 und 4000 USD, was außergewöhnlich hoch war (1000 USD von 1925 entsprechen einem Gegenwert von 12.423,91 USD von 2015). Fitzgerald maß seinen Kurzgeschichten allerdings keinen großen Wert bei. Sie waren für ihn im Wesentlichen Broterwerb, der seine Arbeit am nächsten Roman finanzierte. Ihm lag an einer Anerkennung als einflussreicher und bedeutender Schriftsteller, die aus seiner Sicht nur über die Veröffentlichung weiterer Romane gelingen konnte. Das Ehepaar Fitzgerald stand sehr bald im Mittelpunkt des gesellschaftlichen Lebens, nicht zuletzt auch, weil beide es verstanden, das öffentliche Interesse an ihnen wachzuhalten. Sowohl die Tagespresse als auch Magazine berichteten regelmäßig über das Ehepaar, in den öffentlichen Medien erschienen häufig Fotos und Zeichnungen der beiden. Ruth Prigozy vertritt die Ansicht, dass dazu einerseits beigetragen habe, dass sowohl Scott als auch Zelda Fitzgerald sehr großzügig Interviews gaben. Der entscheidende Faktor ist ihrer Ansicht nach jedoch das Erscheinungsbild von Zelda und Scott Fitzgerald. Wiederholt bezeichneten Zeitungsartikel und Klatschkolumnen sie als mondäne, gut aussehende und charmante Vertreter ihrer Generation. Dazu kamen öffentlichkeitswirksame Auftritte wie Zeldas Bad in einem öffentlichen Brunnen, wilde Partys und Fahrten auf den Dächern von Taxis. Scott Fitzgerald verdiente zwar als Autor außerordentlich gut, gleichzeitig waren er und Zelda mit ihrem Geld jedoch so verschwenderisch, dass sie stets verschuldet waren. Scott Fitzgerald bat häufig sowohl seinen Literaturagenten Harold Ober als auch seinen Lektor Perkins um Vorauszahlungen, um seine Schulden begleichen zu können. Scott Fitzgeralds Alkoholprobleme, mit denen er bis an sein Lebensende kämpfte, begannen gleichfalls im Jahre 1920. 1921 bereiste das Ehepaar Fitzgerald Frankreich, Italien und England und ließ sich danach in St. Paul nieder, wo es weiterhin Gastgeber zahlreicher Partys war. Im Oktober 1921 kam ihr einziges Kind zu Welt. Die Tochter wurde auf den Namen Frances Scott Fitzgerald getauft und Scottie gerufen. Die Schönen und Verdammten (The Beautiful and Damned), Scott Fitzgeralds zweiter Roman und die Geschichten aus der Jazz-Ära (Tales of the Jazz Age) erschienen 1922. Die Schönen und Verdammten war länger und im Tonfall nüchterner als Diesseits vom Paradies, der Roman erhielt verhältnismäßig gute Besprechungen und verkaufte sich auch ganz gut. Literarisch war dieser Roman jedoch weder so vollendet, dass sich Fitzgerald damit als einer der bedeutenden Autoren seiner Zeit etablieren, noch war der Verkaufserfolg groß genug, dass Fitzgerald auf das Verfassen von Kurzgeschichten und Artikel verzichten konnte. Im selben Jahr erfolgte der Umzug der Familie nach Great Neck auf Long Island. In Great Neck lebte eine Reihe der neuen Reichen aus dem Showgeschäft, während auf der anderen Seite der Bucht, in Manhasset Neck, vor allem Familien lebten, die ihren Reichtum bereits im 19. Jahrhundert erworben hatten. In The Great Gatsby wurden aus Great Neck und Manhasset Neck die beiden Orte West Egg und East Egg, deren jeweilige Einwohner sich in gleicher Weise voneinander unterschieden. Obwohl Fitzgerald 1921 und 1922 ausgesprochen produktiv war, fand er es zunehmend schwierig, für seine schriftstellerischen Arbeiten hinreichend Zeit zu finden. Es ist unter Literaturhistorikern strittig, inwieweit Zelda auf den Erfolg von Scott Fitzgerald eifersüchtig war, seine Trunksucht förderte und durch ihre berüchtigten Selbstinszenierungen Fitzgerald gezielt vom Schreiben abhalten wollte. 1924 bis 1940 Fitzgeralds Alkoholismus, der nicht mehr bezahlbare verschwenderische Lebensstil und die zunehmenden psychischen Probleme Zeldas kennzeichneten die zweite Hälfte der 1920er-Jahre der Fitzgeralds. Im April 1924 zog das Ehepaar an die französische Riviera. Eine Beziehung Zeldas zu einem französischen Piloten entfremdete die beiden Ehepartner voneinander. Gleichzeitig arbeitete Fitzgerald an The Great Gatsby, der im April 1925 veröffentlicht wurde. Zur Enttäuschung Fitzgeralds waren sowohl die Kritiken zu diesem Roman als auch die Verkaufszahlen verhalten. Erfolgreicher war dagegen seine 1926 veröffentlichte Sammlung von Kurzgeschichten All The Sad Young Men, obwohl Fitzgerald seinen eigenen Kurzgeschichten zunehmend kritisch gegenüberstand. Fitzgerald empfand gleichzeitig Ernest Hemingway, mit dem er befreundet war, als den besseren Schriftsteller. Hemingway kritisierte Fitzgerald häufig, sich nicht auf sein „wahres“ Talent zu konzentrieren und bemängelte seinen Schreibstil als zu affektiert. 1927 begann Fitzgerald für die Filmindustrie in Hollywood zu arbeiten, was dazu führte, dass die Familie regelmäßig für einige Zeit an der Westküste lebte und dann für einige Monate nach Europa zurückkehrte. Zelda erlitt 1930 einen schweren Nervenzusammenbruch, der dazu führte, dass sie im Schweizer Nyon in eine Klinik eingewiesen wurde und dort 1930 und 1931 lebte. 1932 folgte ein weiterer schwerer Zusammenbruch; diesmal wurde sie in Baltimore in eine Klinik eingewiesen. Während des Klinikaufenthaltes schrieb sie Save Me The Waltz (Ein Walzer für mich), der noch 1932 von Scribner veröffentlicht wurde. Nachdem sein ehrgeiziger Roman Zärtlich ist die Nacht (Tender Is the Night, 1934) weder bei den Kritikern noch den Lesern ein Erfolg wurde, verfiel Fitzgerald 1934. Er trank, war überschuldet und fühlte sich außerstande, zu schreiben. Er litt an Depressionen und nannte diese Zeit später seine Crack-Up-Phase. Von 1937 bis Ende 1938 arbeitete er für MGM in Hollywood und versuchte gleichzeitig Kurzgeschichten zu schreiben, um seiner Schulden Herr zu werden. Seine Tochter Scottie lebte in dieser Zeit im Internat. Seine Ehe mit Zelda, die immer wieder eingewiesen werden musste, zerbrach in dieser Zeit vollständig. Er lernte in dieser Zeit außerdem Sheilah Graham kennen, mit der er bis zu seinem Tode eine Beziehung hatte. 1939 begann er seinen Hollywood-Roman The Last Tycoon. Er starb am 21. Dezember 1940 nach zwei Herzinfarkten. Der letzte Taikun (verfilmt als Der letzte Tycoon) wurde von Edmund Wilson für die Veröffentlichung bearbeitet. Zelda Fitzgerald starb 1948 bei einem Brand im Highland-Krankenhaus in Asheville. In den 1970er-Jahren wurde Fitzgerald durch die erfolgreiche Verfilmung von Der große Gatsby von einem breiten Publikum wiederentdeckt. Das Buch wurde zu einem weltweiten Bestseller. |
G;|Franz (zuletzt Graf) Conrad von Hötzendorf (* 11. November 1852 in Penzing bei Wien; † 25. August 1925 in Mergentheim, Württemberg), war bei Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs 1914 Chef des Generalstabes für die gesamte bewaffnete Macht Österreich-Ungarns, seit 1916 Feldmarschall. Conrad, der zuvor mehrmals vergeblich Präventivkriege der Monarchie gegen Italien und Serbien vorgeschlagen hatte, spielte eine wichtige Rolle in der Julikrise, die zum Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges führte.  Herkunft und Ausbildung Conrad stammte aus einer österreichischen Offiziers- und Beamtenfamilie. Sein Urgroßvater wurde 1815 in den erblichen Adelsstand erhoben. Der Name von Hötzendorf geht auf großmütterliche Vorfahren aus Bayern zurück. Sein Vater Franz Xaver Conrad von Hötzendorf (1793–1878) nahm schon an der Völkerschlacht bei Leipzig teil und bekämpfte die Wiener Revolutionäre in der Revolution von 1848. Dabei wurde er schwer verletzt, was eine Verbitterung gegen 1848er-Revolutionäre und ihre Ideen nach sich zog, die auch seinen Sohn Franz später beeinflusste. Dieser wurde erst 1852 von einer um 32 Jahre jüngeren Frau, einer Tochter des Malers Josef Kügler, geboren, als sein Vater schon im Rang eines Obersten der Husaren pensioniert worden war. Franz entwickelte als Schüler reges Interesse für Naturwissenschaften. Naturgesetze waren ihm wichtiger als religiöse Überzeugungen. Später entwickelte sich Conrad zu einem vehementen Verfechter des Sozialdarwinismus. Conrad besuchte ab Herbst 1863 die Hainburger Kadettenschule, ab Herbst 1867 die Theresianische Militärakademie in Wiener Neustadt, wo er Ende August 1871 als Leutnant zum Feldjäger-Bataillon 11 ausgemustert wurde. Im Herbst 1874 bestand Conrad die Aufnahmsprüfung für die Kriegsschule und beendete seine Generalstabsausbildung im Herbst 1876. Am 1. Mai 1877 wurde er Oberleutnant und diente als Stabsoffizier bei der 6. Kavalleriebrigade in Kaschau. Am 16. August 1878 wurde er dem Generalstab der 4. Infanterie-Truppendivision zugeteilt und nahm im Verband des 3. Korps am Okkupationsfeldzug in Bosnien und Herzegowina und im September 1879 beim Einmarsch in Sandschak Novi Pazar teil. Am 1. Mai 1879 wurde er zum Hauptmann im Generalstabskorps befördert. 1882 war Conrad an der Bekämpfung einer Insurrektion in Süddalmatien beteiligt. Am 10. April 1886 heiratete er in Lemberg seine Verlobte Vilma (1860–1905), Tochter des Geniedirektors August von Le Beau, wobei er nur mit Mühe die für Offiziere vorgeschriebene Heiratskaution aufbringen konnte. Vilma schenkte ihm vier Söhne, 1887 Konrad, 1888 Erwin, 1891 Herbert Conrad und 1896 Egon – alle ergriffen später den Offiziersberuf. Am 29. Oktober 1883 wurde er Stabschef der 11. Infanterie-Truppendivision in Lemberg und begründete seinen Ruf als großer Innovator, indem er beispielsweise Manöver im Gelände statt Übungen nur am Paradeplatz durchsetzte. 1887 kehrte er mit Familie nach Wien zurück, vorerst ins Büro für operative und besondere Generalstabsarbeiten. Am 1. November 1887 wurde er zum Major ernannt und übernahm bis zum September des folgenden Jahres ein Büro für operative Generalstabsarbeiten in Wien. Vom 10. September 1888 bis zum Herbst 1892 war Conrad als Major Taktiklehrer an der k.u.k. Kriegsschule in Wien und wurde dabei am 1. Mai 1890 zum Oberstleutnant befördert. Conrad war ein beliebter Lehrer und viele seiner damaligen Schüler waren ein Vierteljahrhundert später im Weltkrieg hohe, ihm oft ergebene Offiziere. Im Oktober 1892 ließ er sich als Bataillonskommandant des 93. Infanterieregiments nach Olmütz versetzen und wurde am 1. Mai 1893 zum Oberst befördert. Danach gehörte er der Kommission zur Beurteilung der Stabsoffiziers-Aspiranten an. Vom 16. Oktober 1895 bis zum 8. April 1899 war Conrad Kommandant des Infanterieregiments „Kaiser“ Nr. 1 in Troppau. Am 9. April 1899 wurde Conrad zum Kommandanten der 55. Infanteriebrigade in Triest ernannt und am 1. Mai des gleichen Jahres zum Generalmajor befördert. Dort schlug er einen Aufstand italienischer Hafenarbeiter mit Waffengewalt nieder und gewann dabei die Überzeugung, dass die italienischen Ansprüche auf das Trentino und Triest eine Austragung der Gegensätze unausweichlich machten. Am 8. September 1903 übernahm Conrad die Führung der 8. Infanterie-Truppendivision in Innsbruck und wurde am 1. November zum Feldmarschalleutnant befördert. Chef des Generalstabes In der Armee als operativer Denker und auch wegen seiner modernen, kriegsnahen Ausbildungsmethoden bekannt, wurde er am 18. November 1906 auf Vorschlag von Erzherzog Thronfolger Franz Ferdinand von Kaiser Franz Joseph I. durch Allerhöchstes Handschreiben zum Chef des Generalstabs für die gesamte bewaffnete Macht ernannt; er wurde dadurch Nachfolger des auf Betreiben des Thronfolgers aus Altersgründen verabschiedeten Feldzeugmeisters Friedrich Freiherr von Beck-Rzikowsky. Der sich auf Grund des Alters des Kaisers der Macht nähernde Thronfolger wollte eigene Vertrauensleute an Schlüsselpositionen platzieren. Conrad war nun der operativ Verantwortliche für den allfälligen Kriegseinsatz des gemeinsamen Heeres, der Kriegsmarine sowie der Landwehren der beiden Staaten der Monarchie (der k.k. Landwehr und des k.u. Honved). Er war ausschließlich dem Kaiser und König als Oberbefehlshaber und dem von ihm aus Altersgründen bestellten Vertreter, bis 1914 Franz Ferdinand, danach dem Armeeoberkommandanten Erzherzog Friedrich, unterstellt. 1910 wurde Conrad in den Freiherrenstand erhoben, doch führte seine Auseinandersetzung mit Außenminister Graf Aehrenthal, der die von Conrad propagierten Präventivkriege ablehnte, am 3. Dezember 1911 zu seiner Entlassung durch den Kaiser. Noch bei einer Audienz am 15. November 1911 hatte der Kaiser Conrad Vorhaltungen gemacht: „Diese fortwährenden Angriffe, besonders die Vorwürfe wegen Italien und des Balkan, die sich immer wiederholen, die richten sich gegen mich, die Politik mache ich, das ist meine Politik! Meine Politik ist eine Politik des Friedens. Dieser Meiner Politik müssen sich alle anbequemen.“ Ein Skandal wegen seiner Affäre mit der verheirateten Gina Reininghaus, seiner späteren zweiten Ehefrau, spielte dabei ebenfalls eine Rolle. Am 12. Dezember 1912 (inzwischen war Aehrenthal verstorben) erreichte der Thronfolger während der Balkankriege seine erneute Betrauung. Im Mai 1913 versuchte Conrad vergeblich, die Affäre um den Geheimnisverrat von Oberst d. G. Alfred Redl zu verheimlichen. Obwohl sich der Thronfolger für seine Wiederbestellung eingesetzt hatte, verschlechterte sich ihr Verhältnis zusehends und führte im Sommer 1913 fast zur neuerlichen Absetzung Conrads. Vorkriegspolitik Conrads Lebensauffassung wurde der „Aktivismus“, worunter er angriffsfreudige Entschlusskraft, zielbewussten Tatendrang und unbeugsamen Willen verstand. Schon im April 1907 schlug Conrad vor, Italien in einem Präventivkrieg „niederzuwerfen“, ein Vorschlag, den er immer wieder vorbringen sollte. Lange vor dem Krieg sprach Conrad von der Umgestaltung der Monarchie zu einem modernen Imperium und wollte sich an der Aufteilung des europäischen Teils des Osmanischen Reiches noch aktiver, durch dessen Zerschlagung und Einverleibung, beteiligen, um die Monarchie gegen russische und italienische Konkurrenz sowie slawischen Nationalismus zu stärken. Conrad, der am 15. November 1908 zum General der Infanterie ernannt wurde, wünschte wie Franz Ferdinand, eine Beseitigung der ungarischen Machtstellung in der Doppelmonarchie. Der Thronfolger distanzierte sich von Conrad zunehmend wegen dessen aggressiven Annexionismus. Conrad sah als einziges Heilmittel für die schwierige innenpolitische Lage weniger eine zwischen den Nationalitäten der Monarchie ausgleichende, sondern eine auf den Balkan ausgreifende Politik an. Er wollte durch Eingliederung Serbiens in ein südslawisches habsburgisches Königreich den Dualismus durch einen Trialismus ersetzten. Das drückte er schon Ende 1907, noch etwas verklausuliert, in einer Denkschrift aus: Im Frühjahr 1909 wurden Conrads abenteuerliche Pläne zur Einverleibung Serbiens mit vorheriger Niederwerfung des Dreibund-Partners Italien vor allem vom k.u.k. Außen- und vom k.u.k. Kriegsminister abermals abgelehnt. Im Oktober 1912, kurz nach Ausbruch des Ersten Balkankrieges und noch in der Zeit als er nur Armeeinspektor war, entwickelte Conrad den Plan, der neue Balkanbund sollte unter österreichischer Führung das Osmanische Reich in Europa liquidieren und sich danach der Monarchie unterordnen, wie Bayern dem Deutschen Reich In den Jahren 1913 und 1914 forderte Conrad nicht weniger als fünfundzwanzigmal vergeblich den Krieg gegen Serbien, bevor dieser dann tatsächlich zu Stande kam. Als Generalstabschef entwickelte Conrad detaillierte Operationspläne gegen die potentiellen Gegner Russland, Serbien und Italien, die sich zu Kriegsbeginn 1914 allesamt als Makulatur herausstellten. Er gehörte mit den wichtigsten Exponenten der Gesamtmonarchie, dem k.u.k. Außenminister Leopold Berchtold, dem österreichischen Ministerpräsidenten Karl Stürgkh, dem gemeinsamen Finanzminister Leon Biliński und dem k.u.k. Kriegsminister Alexander von Krobatin zur so genannten Kriegspartei, den Befürwortern einer kriegerischen Auseinandersetzung mit Serbien. Der Historiker Wolfram Dornik hat ihn deshalb auch als Falken des Kaisers bezeichnet. Erster Weltkrieg: Vom Sommer 1914 bis zum Tod Kaiser Franz Josephs Conrad war im Sommer 1914 einer der Hauptunterstützer eines sofortigen Krieges gegen das Königreich Serbien als Reaktion auf die Ermordung des Thronfolgers in Sarajewo. Er wollte auf die Nachricht vom Attentat sofort mit dem Angriff beginnen, aber Berchtold und Kaiser Franz Joseph hielten eine Untersuchung und diplomatische Vorbereitung für notwendig. Zu einem „Überraschungsschlag“ gegen Serbien, wie ihn Deutschland nach dem „Blankoscheck“ vom 5./6. Juli erwartete, fehlten der Monarchie die politischen und militärischen Voraussetzungen. Conrad wollte damit nur den Kriegszustand erreichen, der von den Politikern gegen seinen Willen oft verhindert worden war, und jegliche Friedensmöglichkeit ausschließen. Nach dem Ultimatum an Serbien drängte Conrad Kaiser und Außenminister: Die Rückkehr zum Friedenszustand sei bei der Stimmung in der Armee nicht möglich. Nach der Entscheidung des Kaisers und Königs für die Kriegserklärung brachte er den Schwerpunkt der österreichisch-ungarischen Armee gegen Serbien in Stellung, musste jedoch nach dem Eintritt Russlands in den Krieg große Teile der Truppen nach Galizien verlegen, wo der russische Angriff erwartet wurde. Die daraus resultierende Verspätung und die Unterschätzung insbesondere des russischen Gegners führte beinahe zum frühzeitigen Ausscheiden Österreich-Ungarns aus dem Krieg. Conrad gelang es allerdings, mit massiver deutscher Unterstützung die von Russland besetzten Teile Galiziens und der Bukovina zurückzuerobern, Serbien und Montenegro sowie Rumänien zu erobern und eine stabile Front gegen Italien zu organisieren. Nach der Rückeroberung Lembergs wurde Conrad am 23. Juni 1915 zum Generaloberst befördert. Die Zusammenarbeit mit der deutschen Obersten Heeresleitung (OHL) war schon bald getrübt. Für Conrad sah der Leiter der zweiten OHL Erich von Falkenhayn im Verbündeten nur den schwächeren Bruder, dem er die Anerkennung versagte, um alle Erfolge auf seine Rechnung zu buchen, und der danach strebte, für die erhoffte Zukunft Deutschlands Hegemonie über Österreich anzubahnen. Conrad rechnete sich selbst auf die Seite von Tirpitz, auf die andere Seite Falkenhayn und Bethmann Hollweg. Conrad redete immer der Offensive das Wort, Falkenhayn huldigte der Ermattungsstrategie. Die persönliche Kommunikation zwischen den beiden Befehlshabern riss im Frühjahr 1916 schließlich völlig ab. Conrad war ein entschiedener Verfechter weitreichender Kriegsziele der Monarchie. Seit November 1915 bestürmte Conrad Außenminister Burián mündlich, aber auch in endlosen Denkschriften, die auf dem Balkan eroberten Gebiete zu annektieren. Schon vor Abschluss des entscheidenden Feldzuges gegen Serbien und Montenegro Anfang November 1915 meinte er, „dass nur die völlige Einverleibung Serbiens und Montenegros in die Monarchie (mindestens als untrennbarer Bundesstaat) der Gefahr vorzubeugen vermag, welche mit einem selbständigen Serbien und Montenegro, seien diese auch noch so klein, verbunden wäre. Sie blieben (unabhängig) nach wie vor die Agitationsherde für unsere Gegner, vornehmlich Rußland und Italien, und würden bei jedem Krieg der Monarchie deren militärische Lage empfindlichst erschweren.“ Doch insbesondere Ungarn wehrte sich gegen eine annexionistische Politik, da ein Ungleichgewicht innerhalb der Monarchie und verschlechterte Friedensbedingungen nach dem Krieg befürchtet wurden. Als Conrad im Februar 1916 beim Kaiser auch die Annexion Montenegros und Nordalbaniens durchsetzen wollte, antwortete dieser: Was, das auch noch? Das ist zuviel! Conrad entgegnete: Ja, aber es ist notwendig. (Ein) Selbständiges Albanien ist unmöglich. Der ungarische Ministerpräsident István Tisza erschien Conrad als großer Gegenspieler, als Schreckensbild, obwohl die beiden eine gute Gesprächsbasis aufrechterhielten; den k.u.k. Außenminister Burián sah er in dessen Schlepptau als das Horn Tiszas. Der politisch überwältigenden Durchschlagskraft Ungarns und Tiszas stünde herüben (gemeint ist Österreich) ein Trottel, nämlich Stürgkh, gegenüber. Daher versuchte Conrad, Anfang 1916 den Sturz von Ministerpräsident Stürgkh herbeizuführen, und trat für den damaligen k.k. Innenminister Konrad zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst als Nachfolger und Gegengewicht zu Tiszas Ungarn ein. Conrad hatte mit diesen Intrigen allerdings keinen Erfolg. Mangels großer militärischer Erfolge hatten Conrad und die Leute vom k.u.k. Armeeoberkommando nicht das politische Gewicht, das es ihnen, wie im Fall der dritten OHL in Deutschland, ermöglicht hätte, die zivilen Instanzen zu dominieren. Erster Weltkrieg: Enthebung durch den neuen Kaiser Armeeoberkommandant war an Stelle des zu dieser Zeit 86-jährigen Kaisers bis 2. Dezember 1916 Erzherzog Friedrich. Dieser ließ Conrad, dem ihm unterstellten Chef des Generalstabes, weitestgehend freie Hand. Nach dem Tod Franz Joseph I. übernahm am 2. Dezember 1916 der junge Kaiser Karl I. persönlich den Oberbefehl. Erzherzog Friedrich fungierte bis zu seiner Enthebung am 11. Februar 1917 als sein Stellvertreter. Conrad war am 23. November 1916 noch zum k.u.k. Feldmarschall ernannt worden, doch sein Einfluss nahm stark ab. Er wurde von Karl I. gegen seinen Willen am 1. März 1917 als Chef des Generalstabes durch Arthur Arz von Straußenburg ersetzt, übernahm aber auf Druck des Kaisers später das Kommando an der Südwestfront gegen Italien in Tirol, um die Italiener glauben zu machen, an dieser Front werde der nächste Hauptangriff der k.u.k. Streitkräfte erfolgen. Nach der gescheiterten Junioffensive (von Asiago bis zum unteren Piave) und der gescheiterten Offensive am Monte Grappa wurde Conrad am 14. Juli 1918 von Karl I. auch seiner Position als Befehlshaber der Heeresgruppe in Tirol enthoben. Um diese Entscheidung nicht zu harsch wirken zu lassen, erhob ihn der Kaiser gleichzeitig in den Grafenstand und ernannte ihn ehrenhalber zum Obersten aller kaiserlichen Garden in Wien. Das Auseinanderbrechen der Monarchie wenige Monate später hielt Conrad für die Folge des mangelnden Gehörs, das seine Warnungen und Vorhersagen gefunden hätten. Krankheit und Tod Die Jahre nach dem Krieg verbrachte Conrad in Wien und Innsbruck. Er arbeitete an Veröffentlichungen über sein Leben und versuchte sein Wirken zu rechtfertigen. Nach einem schweren Gallenleiden auf Kur in Bad Mergentheim, beklagte er in seinen Memoiren, die Familie Habsburg, insbesondere Erzherzog Friedrich, dem er über zwei Jahre lang erfolgreich gedient habe, habe sich nicht einmal zu Genesungswünschen an ihn aufraffen können. Conrad starb am 25. August 1925 in Bad Mergentheim an einem Rückfall. Er wurde auf dem Hietzinger Friedhof (Gruppe 37, Reihe 1, Nummer 1) in Wien begraben. Den pompösen Begräbnisfeierlichkeiten am 2. September wohnten mehr als 100.000 Trauergäste bei. Das Ehrengrab wurde 2012 im Zuge der Diskussion um das Ehrengrab von Engelbert Dollfuß von der Gemeinde Wien wie dieses in ein „Historisches Grab“ umgewandelt. |
G;|Robert Lecourt (* 19. September 1908 in Pavilly, Département Seine-Maritime; † 13. August 2004 in Boulogne-Billancourt, Département Hauts-de-Seine) war ein französischer Jurist und Politiker der Mouvement républicain populaire (MRP), der zwischen 1946 und 1959 Mitglied der Nationalversammlung war sowie 1948, 1949 sowie zwischen 1957 und 1958 das Amt des Justizministers bekleidete. Später war er zwischen 1959 und 1961 Staatsminister im Kabinett Debré. 1962 wurde Lecourt zum Richter am Europäischen Gerichtshof berufen, dessen Präsident er zwischen 1967 und 1976 war. Zuletzt fungierte er zwischen 1980 und 1989 als Richter am Conseil constitutionnel, dem Verfassungsgerichtshof Frankreichs.  Studium, Rechtsanwalt und Beginn der politischen Laufbahn Lecourt, Sohn eines Kaufmanns, absolvierte seine schulische Ausbildung am Pensionnat Jean-Baptiste-de-La-Salle de Rouen und begann im Anschluss ein Studium der Rechtswissenschaften an der Universität Caen. Nach Abschluss des Studiums und der Promotion zum Doktor der Rechtswissenschaften mit einer Dissertation zum Thema „Die Rechtsnatur der Handlung in der Wiederherstellung. Eine Studie der französischen Rechtsprechung“ (‚La nature juridique de l'action en réintégrande, étude de la jurisprudence française‘) nahm er 1931 zunächst eine Tätigkeit als Rechtsanwalt in Rouen auf, wechselte aber bereits 1932 als Rechtsanwalt an das Appellationsgericht (Cour d’appel) in Paris. Daneben begann Lecourt, ein überzeugter Katholik, seine politische Laufbahn als er von Jean Raymond-Laurent 1934 in die Fédération des Jeunesses Démocrates Populaires (FJDP) aufgenommen wurde, dem Jugendverband der Parti démocrate populaire (PDP). 1936 wurde er Generalsekretär der FJDP und übte diese Funktion bis zum Beginn des Zweiten Weltkrieges 1939 aus. 1936 wurde er zudem Mitglied des Vorstands der PDP und verfasste Artikel für die Parteizeitung L’Aube, in denen er eine kritische Haltung zum Münchner Abkommen vom 30. September 1938 einnahm. Zweiter Weltkrieg Mitglied der Résistance und die Befreiung von Paris Als Gegner des Nationalsozialismus engagierte sich Lecourt in der Widerstandsbewegung Résistance, in deren Vorstand er seit 1942 Mitglied war. Nach der Befreiung von Paris im August 1944 wurde er für die Résistance Mitglied der Provisorischen Beratenden Versammlung (Assemblée consultative provisoire) in Paris und wurde in dieser zum Mitglied des Ausschusses für Gefangene und Deportierte sowie des Justizausschusses berufen. Er war in dieser Zeit Verfasser einer Resolution, in denen die vollständige Entschädigung von Kriegsschäden gefordert wurde, sowie einer weiteren Resolution, die eine Änderung der Wahlgesetzgebung verlangte, um eine proportionale Vertretung sicherzustellen. Am 28. Oktober 1944 nahm er an einer Generaldebatte über die allgemeine Regierungspolitik teil, in der er forderte, dass nach dem Gewinn des Krieges sofort mit der Wiederherstellung der Welt begonnen werden sollte, und zwar für die Menschen und nicht für deren Ausbeutung. Dabei stellte er heraus, dass die Zukunft Frankreichs von der Harmonie dreier Elemente abhängen würde: eine legitime Regierung, die Achtung der Menschenrechte und eine Résistance, die sich nicht als große Partei sah, sondern als Vermittler zwischen den Parteien und damit letztlich der öffentlichen Meinung. Die Politik Frankreichs sollte schnellstmöglich wieder in eine Legalität und eine Demokratie zurückgeführt werden. Ferner schlug er wegen der großen Zahl der Gefangenen zumindest die Durchführung provisorischer Wahlen vor. Dabei sollte der Résistance eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Vorbereitung der Wahlen zukommen. Die Debatten zum Justizwesen in der Beratenden Versammlung Bei einer Debatte am 21. Februar 1945 zur Arbeit der Commission d’Épuration zur Säuberung des Staatsapparates befasste er sich mit der Entfernung der Kollabourateure, um das Land wieder aufzubauen. Eine der Schwierigkeiten lag dabei auch in der Säuberung des Justizwesens. Er stellte fest, dass die Säuberung radikal war, und befürchtete, dass Frankreich am Ende nur einen Untersuchungsrichter hätte, während alle anderen ausgeschlossenen Juristen Philippe Pétain und dessen Vichy-Regime verteidigen würden. Vor dem Hintergrund, dass es fünf Jahre dauern würde, um Richter auszubilden, hielt es Lecourt für achtsam, auch Richter, die mit dem Vichy-Regime und dem Deutschen Reich kollaboriert hatten, im Justizdienst zu halten. Dabei verstand er sich auch als Rechtsanwalt am Appellationsgericht, für den die Rechte der Verteidigung zu achten sind. Am 15. März 1945 nahm Lecourt an einer weiteren Debatte teil, in der es um die Aufhebung von Enteignungen durch den Feind ging. Er wies darauf hin, dass das Gesetz zwischen Enteignungen unterscheide, in denen der Enteignete seine Zustimmung gegeben hätte, und denen, in denen es keine Zustimmung gab. Die Letzteren sollten aus seiner Sicht nichtig sein, wenngleich die Realität durchaus komplexer war. Allerdings sollte es keine Privilegierung von Enteigneten zu Lasten anderer Kriegsopfer geben. Darüber hinaus drückte er die Hoffnung aus, dass nicht der Staat für Entschädigung aufzukommen habe. Ferner beteiligte er sich am 25. Juli 1945 an der Debatte zur Wahl einer Verfassunggebenden Versammlung. Dabei sprach er sich deutlich für eine neue Verfassung aus, da die Verfassung von 1875 seit dem Verfassungsgesetz des Vichy-Regimes vom 10. Juli 1940 gestorben sei (‚la constitution de 1875 est morte le 10 juillet 1940‘). Dabei sollte die Verantwortlichkeit der Minister mit der Sorge um Stabilität verbunden werden. Für das Verfahren schlug er eine demokratische Volksabstimmung auf der Grundlage von Artikel 6 der Erklärung der Menschen- und Bürgerrechte vom 26. August 1789 ((Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen)) vor. Vierte Republik Mitglied der Verfassunggebenden Versammlungen Lecourt, der neben Georges Bidault 1944 zu den Mitgründern der Mouvement républicain populaire (MRP) gehört hatte, kandidierte für die MRP im zweiten Wahlkreis des Département Seine bei den Wahlen am 21. Oktober 1945 für ein Mandat in der Verfassunggebende Versammlung (Assemblée Constituante). Mit 133.702 der 443.058 abgegebenen Stimmen lag die MRP weit vor der Liste der Parti communiste français (PCF) und gewann vier Sitze. Lecourt wurde daraufhin Mitglied des Justizausschusses (Commission de la justice) und forderte in einer Sitzung am 17. Januar 1946 die Zulassung von Frauen zum Richteramt. Bei der Neuwahl einer Verfassunggebenden Versammlung am 2. Juni 1946 lag die MRP hinter der von Joseph Denais angeführten Liste der Parti républicain de la liberté (PRL) und konnte diesmal mit 107.796 der 452.255 abgegebenen Stimmen zwei Mandate gewinnen. Er wurde daraufhin abermals Mitglied des Justizausschusses und wirkte an den Debatten zur Verfassung vom 13. Oktober 1946 mit, die nach einem Kompromiss der drei großen Parteien MRP, Section française de l’Internationale ouvrière (SFIO) sowie PCF zustande kam und nach ihrer Annahme in einer Volksabstimmung zur Gründung der Vierten Französischen Republik am 21. Oktober 1946 führte. Wahl zum Mitglied der Nationalversammlung 1946 Bei den daraufhin am 10. November 1946 stattgefundenen Wahlen zur ersten Nationalversammlung der Vierten Republik erreichte die von Lecourt angeführte Liste im zweiten Wahlkreis des Département Seine erneut den zweiten Platz mit 109.407 der 452.158 abgegebenen Wählerstimmen und konnte diesmal drei Abgeordnete stellen. In dieser ersten Legislaturperiode wurde er Mitglied des Ausschusses für Verwaltungsreformen (Commission de la réforme administrative) sowie des Finanzausschusses (Commission des finances). Dabei war er am 11. Februar 1947 maßgeblich an einem Gesetz zur Rentenregelung für geschiedene Frauen beteiligt. Da Lecourt zunächst nicht Mitglied der Regierung wurde, übernahm er die Funktion als Vorsitzender der Fraktion der MRP. Justizminister Am 26. Juli 1948 wurde Lecourt von Premierminister André Marie als Siegelbewahrer (Garde des Sceaux) und Justizminister (Ministre de la Justice) in dessen Regierung berufen und verblieb in diesem Amt bis zum 28. August 1948. Diese Ämter übernahm er anschließend auch in der zweiten Regierung von Premierminister Robert Schuman bis zum Rücktritt am 7. September 1948 nach nur zwei Tagen im Amt. Lecourt wurde daraufhin von Staatspräsident Vincent Auriol beauftragt, Gespräche zum Fortbestand der Regierung zu führen, da er den Rücktritt der Regierung nicht annehmen wollte. Nach dem Rücktritt von André Marie übernahm Lecourt in der ersten Regierung von Premierminister Henri Queuille am 13. Februar 1949 erneut die Ämter als Siegelbewahrer und Justizminister sowie als Vize-Premierminister (Vice-président du Conseil). In diesen Funktionen stellte er zahlreiche Gesetzesentwürfe vor wie zum Beispiel zur Reform der Strafprozessordnung (Code d’instruction criminelle) und am 24. Februar 1949 zur Aufhebung eines Gesetzes vom 26. Juni 1949 zur Erstellung von Bescheinigung für die Eignung als Rechtsanwalt. Am 31. Juli 1949 folgte die Auflösung der am 26. Juni 1944 geschaffenen Justizgerichte (Cour de justice) und die Abgabe dort noch anhängigen Verfahren an die Militärtribunale. Sein im Juni 1949 im Ministerrat vorgelegtes Amnestiegesetz führte zu umfangreichen Diskussionen, so dass er am 29. Juni 1949 einen abgeänderten Entwurf vorlegte. Premierminister Queuille beauftragte ihn anschließend auch mit dem Entwurf eines Gesetzes für Rückkehrer. Die Affäre Joanovici und Ausscheiden aus der Regierung Dies führte dazu, dass der Abgeordnete Vincent Badie von der Parti républicain, radical et radical-socialiste (RRRS) den Justizminister um Abgabe einer Erklärung im Falle von Joseph Joanovici aufforderte, der sowohl mit der deutschen Besatzungsmacht als auch mit der französischen Widerstandsbewegung zusammengearbeitet hatte und hierfür 1949 zu einer Haftstrafe verurteilt worden war. Dabei stellte sich heraus, dass Lecourt 1944 für die Résistance ein Schreiben zugunsten eines Mannes namens Spass verfasst hatte, der aber tatsächlich Joanovici war. Daraufhin forderte Badie die Regierung auf, die Gründe für die lange Dauer im Verfahren gegen Joanovici und zu dem Schreiben mitzuteilen. Lecourt verwies auf die kriegsbedingte Situation und die inneren Kämpfe. Nachdem Georges Bidault am 28. Oktober 1949 Nachfolger Queuilles als Premierminister wurde, schied Lecourt als Justizminister aus dem Ministerium am Place Vendôme aus und übernahm stattdessen wieder die Funktion als Vorsitzender der MRP-Fraktion in der Nationalversammlung. Wiederwahl zum Mitglied der Nationalversammlung 1951 Bei den Wahlen zur Nationalversammlung am 17. Juni 1961 verlor die von Lecourt angeführte MRP-Liste im zweiten Wahlkreis des Département Seine zwei ihrer drei Sitze. Die Liste der MRP lag mit 26.511 der 416.592 abgebenen Wählerstimmen hinter den Listen der gaullistischen Rassemblement du peuple français (RPF), der PCF, der Rassemblement des gauches républicaines (RGR) sowie der SFIO zurück und war nahezu gleich auf mit der von Jacques Isorni angeführten Liste des Centre national des indépendants et paysans (CNIP). Nach seiner Wahl wurde Lecourt erneut Mitglied des Finanzausschusses und war ferner Sprecher der MRP-Fraktion für Verfassungsrecht. Während dieser Zeit schlug er am 27. März 1952 vor, die Zahl der Ausschussmitglieder auf 32 zu begrenzen, um die Arbeit der Nationalversammlung im Palais Bourbon zu vereinfachen. Am 22. Dezember 1952 teilte er mit, dass sich die MRP nicht an einem Misstrauensvotum gegen Premierminister Antoine Pinay beteiligen würde, und vertrat zum anderen am 6. Mai 1953 die MRP in der Debatte über den neuen Premierminister René Mayer. In der Folgezeit befasste er sich mit Fragen zur Inflation, zu den Schwierigkeiten im Wohnungsbau, aber auch zur Europäischen Verteidigungsgemeinschaft (EVG). 1953 sprach er sich in den Debatten gegen Paul Reynaud und Pierre Mendès France als Kandidaten für das Amt des Premierministers aus. In einer Debatte vom 27. November 1953 sprach er sich für die Notwendigkeit eines supranationalen Europas aus. Er gehörte zu den wichtigsten Kritikern der Regierung von Premierminister Mendès France und trug maßgeblich zu dessen Abwahl am 5. Februar 1955 bei. In der am 18. Februar 1955 von Christian Pineau vorgestellten Regierung sollte Lecourt das Amt des Ministers für nationale Verteidigung übernehmen. Hierzu kam es jedoch nicht, da die von Pineau vorgeschlagene Regierung von der Nationalversammlung mit 312 zu 268 Stimmen abgelehnt wurde und stattdessen Edgar Faure am 23. Februar 1955 zum zweiten Mal Premierminister wurde. Diese neuerliche Verfassungskrise führte dazu, dass Lecourt auf die Notwendigkeit einer Verfassungsänderung hinwies und hierzu auch einige Vorschläge unterbreitete. Wiederwahl 1956 und Justizminister 1957 bis 1958 Bei den Wahlen zur Nationalversammlung holte die von Lecourt angeführte Liste der MRP lediglich 20.274 der 491.457 abgegebenen Stimmen im zweiten Wahlkreis des Département Seine und gewann damit nur noch einen Sitz, den er selbst einnahm. Er wurde abermals Vorsitzender der MRP-Fraktion. In dieser Funktion setzte er sich für Verhandlungen mit dem Heiligen Stuhl über die Frage der Schulbildung ein. Am 8. März 1956 stimmte Premierminister Guy Mollet derartigen Verhandlungen zu, die von Lecourt bei einem Treffen am 2. April 1955 mit Papst Pius XII. und dem Pro-Staatssekretär für außerordentliche kirchliche Angelegenheiten, Domenico Kardinal Tardini, vorbereitet wurden. Am 6. November 1957 wurde Lecourt von Premierminister Félix Gaillard abermals zum Siegelbewahrer und Justizminister in dessen Regierung berufen. Diese Ämter bekleidete er auch in der nachfolgenden Regierung von Premierminister Pierre Pflimlin bis zum 31. Mai 1958. Hierbei setzte er seine Bemühungen zur Reform der Verfassung fort. Fünfte Republik Minister im Kabinett Debré Bei den Wahlen zur ersten Nationalversammlung der am 5. Oktober 1958 gegründeten Fünften Französischen Republik am 30. November 1958 kandidierte Lecourt im Département Hautes-Alpes für das der MRP nahestehende Wahlbündnis Républicains populaires et centre démocratique und wurde erneut Mitglied der Nationalversammlung. Auf dieses Abgeordnetenmandat verzichtete er jedoch am 8. Februar 1959 nachdem er einen Monat zuvor am 8. Januar 1959 von Premierminister Michel Debré als Staatsminister (Ministre d’État) in dessen Kabinett berufen wurde. Als solcher war er seit dem 27. März 1959 bis zum 5. Februar 1960 Verantwortlicher Minister für Zusammenarbeit (Ministre d’État, chargé de la coopération) sowie im Anschluss vom 5. Februar 1960 bis zum 24. August 1961 Verantwortlicher Minister für die Sahara sowie für die Überseegebiete (Ministre d’État, chargé du Sahara, des TOM et DOM). Nach seinem Rücktritt folgte ihm Louis Jacquinot in diesen Ämtern. Europäischer Gerichtshof und Conseil constitutionnel Am 18. Mai 1962 wurde Lecourt als Nachfolger von Jacques Rueff zum Richter am Europäischen Gerichtshof ernannt. Er war dort bis zum 25. Oktober 1976 tätig und wurde im Anschluss von Adolphe Touffait abgelöst. Während dieser Zeit wurde er am 10. Oktober 1967 auch Nachfolger von Charles Léon Hammes als Präsident des Europäischen Gerichtshofes und war damit der erste und bislang einzige Franzose in dieser Position. Das Amt des Präsidenten des Europäischen Gerichtshofes bekleidete er ebenfalls bis zum 25. Oktober 1976 und wurde danach von Hans Kutscher abgelöst. Zuletzt wurde Lecourt 1980 auf Vorschlag von Senatspräsident Alain Poher als Nachfolger von Paul Coste-Floret zum Mitglied des Conseil constitutionnel berufen. Er gehörte dem Verfassungsgericht neun Jahre lang bis 1989 an und wurde dann von Jean Cabannes abgelöst. Für seine langjährigen Verdienste wurde er Kommandeur der Ehrenlegion und Träger des Croix de Guerre. |
G;|Ronaldinho [xonawˈdʒĩɲu], bürgerlich Ronaldo de Assis Moreira und in Brasilien Ronaldinho Gaúcho genannt (* 21. März 1980 in Porto Alegre), ist ein brasilianischer Fußballspieler. Im Jahr 2002 wurde er mit der brasilianischen Nationalmannschaft Weltmeister. Mit dem FC Barcelona wurde er zweimal spanischer Meister und einmal Champions-League-Sieger. Der offensive Mittelfeldspieler wurde durch Tempodribblings, hohe Torgefährlichkeit und enorme Passgenauigkeit bekannt. Er wurde 2005 zu Europas Fußballer des Jahres sowie 2004 und 2005 zum Weltfußballer des Jahres gewählt.   Vereine Grêmio Porto Alegre Seine Jugendzeit verbrachte Ronaldinho in Brasilien bei Grêmio Porto Alegre. Von April 1993 bis Oktober 1994 absolvierte er einen Sprachaufenthalt in der französischsprachigen Schweiz, wo sein neun Jahre älterer Bruder Roberto Assis als Profi beim FC Sion spielte. Ronaldinho spielte so bei den C-Junioren (U-14) des FC Sion einige Meisterschaftsspiele. Seine Profikarriere begann er 1997 bei Grêmio in der ersten brasilianischen Liga. Paris Saint-Germain 2001 ging er nach Frankreich zu Paris Saint-Germain. FC Barcelona 2003 wechselte Ronaldinho für rund 30 Millionen Euro zum FC Barcelona. In seiner ersten Saison bei den Katalanen brachte ihm seine Spielweise die Auszeichnung des Weltfußballers ein. In der Saison 2004/05 dominierte er mit dem FC Barcelona die Primera División und wurde spanischer Meister. 2005 wurde Ronaldinho zum besten Fußballer Europas und – zum zweiten Mal hintereinander – zum besten Fußballer der Welt gewählt. Er gewann mit deutlichem Abstand vor Frank Lampard (FC Chelsea) und seinem Teamkollegen Samuel Eto’o. Im September verlängerte Ronaldinho seinen bis 2008 laufenden Vertrag zu erhöhten Bezügen vorzeitig bis 2010. In der Saison 2005/06 gewann er neben der Primera División auch die UEFA Champions League. Doch schon in der nächsten Saison wurden seine Leistungen immer schwächer; infolgedessen kam er zu immer weniger Einsätzen. Trotzdem gehörte er noch zu den besten Spielern der Welt und belegte bei der Wahl zum Weltfußballer des Jahres 2007 den 5. Platz. AC Mailand Da Rijkaards Nachfolger Pep Guardiola für die Saison 2008/09 nicht mehr mit Ronaldinho plante, wechselte er im August 2008 für eine Ablösesumme von 25 Millionen Euro zum AC Mailand. Laut einer Studie der France Football blieb er mit einem Jahreseinkommen von 19,6 Millionen Euro inkl. Werbegelder einer der Topverdiener des Profifußballs. Nachdem Ronaldinho auch in Mailand wegen mangelnder Fitness zunächst der Form früherer Jahre hinterhergelaufen war, gelang ihm in der Saison 2009/10 eine deutliche Leistungssteigerung. Die Hinrunde der Saison 2010/11 spielte er im 4-3-3-System von Massimiliano Allegri gemeinsam mit Zlatan Ibrahimović und Alexandre Pato im Sturm, wurde dann aber von Neuzugang Robinho verdrängt. Auch als Pato verletzt ausfiel, baute Allegri nicht auf Ronaldinho, sondern stellte das System auf 4-3-1-2 um, in dem Kevin-Prince Boateng den Part hinter den Spitzen übernahm. Ronaldinho kam nur noch zu Kurzeinsätzen. Nachdem mit Antonio Cassano noch ein weiterer Konkurrent in der Winterpause verpflichtet worden war, stellte der AC Mailand Ronaldinho vom Training frei und gestattete ihm die Abreise aus dem Trainingslager in Dubai, um für Vertragsverhandlungen nach Brasilien zu reisen. Ronaldinho spielte in drei Spielzeiten 76-mal für den AC Mailand in der Serie A und erzielte dabei 20 Treffer. Hinzu kamen zwölf Champions-League-Einsätze mit vier Toren und sechs UEFA-Cup-Einsätze, in denen er zwei Tore erzielte. Dabei konnte Ronaldinho zwar einige Male an frühere Leistungen anknüpfen, es mangelte ihm jedoch an Konstanz. Flamengo Rio de Janeiro Im Januar 2011 wechselte Ronaldinho für eine Ablösesumme von 3 Millionen Euro vom AC Mailand zurück zu Flamengo Rio de Janeiro. Nachdem sich auch sein Jugendverein Grêmio und der SE Palmeiras um ihn bemüht hatten, unterschrieb er in Rio de Janeiro einen Vertrag bis Juli 2014 und erhielt die Rückennummer 10. Von dem Wechsel hoffte er, wieder an alte Leistungen anknüpfen zu können, um so seine Chancen für eine Teilnahme an der Copa América 2011 und der WM 2014 im eigenen Land zu steigern, nachdem er für die WM 2010 nicht nominiert worden war. Ronaldinho folgte auch einem Trend früherer Stars wie etwa Roberto Carlos und Ronaldo, nach Brasilien zurückzukehren. Sein erstes Spiel für seinen neuen Verein absolvierte Ronaldinho am 2. Februar 2011 in der Taça Guanabara, der Hinrunde der Staatsmeisterschaft von Rio de Janeiro, beim 1:0 gegen den Nova Iguaçu FC. Vor dem Spiel bekam er demonstrativ die Kapitänsbinde von Vorgänger Leonardo Moura überreicht. Außerdem bekam sein Premieren-Trikot einen Ehrenplatz, als im November 2011 das Flamengo-Museum eröffnet wurde. Am 1. Mai 2011 besiegte Flamengo in der Rückrunde der Staatsmeisterschaft, dem Wettbewerb um die Taça Rio, den CR Vasco da Gama, nach einem 0:0 in der regulären Spielzeit mit 3:1 im Elfmeterschießen und gewann damit seine 32. Staatsmeisterschaft. Sein Debüt in der nationalen Liga gab Ronaldinho noch im selben Monat am ersten Spieltag beim 4:0-Sieg gegen den Avaí FC, zu dem er das Tor zum 2:0 beisteuerte. Am 27. Juli gelang ihm ein Hattrick gegen den FC Santos; Flamengo gewann 5:4 nach einem 0:3-Rückstand. Mit 14 Saisontreffern gehörte Ronaldinho zu den fünf besten Torschützen der Brasileirão von 2011. Flamengo wurde Vierter. Ende Mai 2012, nach dem zweiten Spieltag der nationalen Meisterschaft, trennten sich Ronaldinho und Flamengo nach wenig erfolgreichen 16 Monaten, in denen er erneut häufig durch Disziplinlosigkeiten auffiel. Während er in den ersten sieben Monaten noch regelmäßig pünktlich beim Training erschien, war er dennoch bereits ein konstanter Faktor im Nachtleben von Rio. Eine Intervention des Vereins bei seinem Manager und Bruder Roberto Assis führte vornehmlich dazu, dass Ronaldinho großteils seine öffentlichen nächtlichen Aktivitäten durch häufige bis in die frühen Stunden anhaltenden Festivitäten in seiner Villa im westlichen Nobelvorort Barra da Tijuca ersetzte. Bei mehreren Gelegenheiten war er nicht fähig, am Training teilzunehmen. Seine Leistungen auf dem Platz moderierten sich zusehends. Zunächst war Trainer Vanderlei Luxemburgo bemüht, die Probleme nicht zu thematisieren. Dennoch fand ab 2012 der Unmut Luxemburgos zusehends Einzug in das öffentliche Bewusstsein. Nachdem Ronaldinho während einer Concentração, dem Trainingslager vor einem Spiel, in Londrina mit einer Frau umgänglich war – ein Tabu – forderte Vanderlei Luxemburgo entschlossene Maßnahmen von Vereinspräsidentin Patricia Amorim. In der Folge wurde Luxemburgo entlassen und durch Joel Santana ersetzt; Ronaldinho wurde dagegen verziehen. Die Details des letztendlichen Abgangs von Ronaldinho wurden nicht öffentlich. Nach erstweiligen Berichten schuldete der Verein dem Spieler aufgrund dessen vorzeitiger Entlassung rund 40,2 Millionen Real (Im Mai 2012 rund 15,8 Mio. Euro). In insgesamt 78 Spielen für Flamengo erzielte Ronaldinho 28 Tore, sah 19-mal Gelb und zweimal Rot. Atlético Mineiro Nach 16 Monaten bei Flamengo wechselte Ronaldinho zum Staatsmeister von Minas Gerais Atlético Mineiro aus Belo Horizonte. Sein für den 6. Juni 2012 am dritten Spieltag geplantes Debüt fiel aus, da die Freigabe vom Verband noch nicht vorlag. So absolvierte er drei Tage später beim 1:0-Auswärtssieg gegen Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras sein Debüt über die volle Spielzeit. Am 6. Oktober 2012 erzielte er einen Hattrick gegen den Figueirense Futebol Clube. Nach der Saison wurde er zum besten Spieler des Jahres 2012 der höchsten Brasilianischen Spielklasse gewählt. Am 25. Juli 2013 gewann er mit Atlético die Copa Libertadores, womit er erst der sechste Spieler in der Geschichte des Fußballs ist, der die Copa Libertadores und die UEFA Champions League gewonnen hat. Ende 2013 wurde Ronaldinho als Südamerikas Fußballer des Jahres ausgezeichnet. Anfang Januar 2014 verlängerte Ronaldinho seinen Vertrag um ein Jahr bis zum 31. Dezember 2014. Am 27. Juli 2014 lösten Ronaldinho und Atlético Mineiro den Vertrag auf. Querétaro Fútbol Club Anfang September 2014 unterzeichnete er einen Zweijahresvertrag beim mexikanischen Erstligisten Querétaro Fútbol Club. Ronaldinho der als großer Hoffnungsträger galt, machte sein Debüt am 17. September im Pokal-Spiel gegen UANL Tigres. Vier Tage später folgte sein Debüt in der Liga, gegen Deportivo Guadalajara stand er über die vollen 90 Minuten auf dem Platz, erzielte ein Tor und bereitete ein Weiteres vor. Im Dezember 2014 erhielt Ronaldinho, von Trainer Ignacio Ambríz einen genehmigten Sonderurlaub, damit er sich um persönliche Angelegenheiten in Brasilien kümmern kann. Als er danach aber nicht wieder zum Training erschien, sondern tagelang verschollen blieb, stellte Sportdirektor Joaquín Beltrán dem Brasilianer ein Ultimatum. Ist er bis Ende der Woche nicht wieder da, würde man sich von ihm trennen. Kurz vor Ende dieser Frist tauchte Ronaldinho wieder auf. Zur Clausura kam er meist nur noch als Einwechselspieler zum Einsatz. Das Verhältnis zwischen ihm und Verein schien merklich angespannt. Nach schwacher Hinrunde, verbesserte sich Ronaldinhos Form wieder im Laufe der Clausura-Saison. Er hatte maßgeblichen Anteil am Erreichen der Playoffs. Im Halbfinal-Hinspiel gegen CF Pachuca sorgte Ronaldinho allerdings für Aufsehen. Als er in der ersten Halbzeit wegen einer taktischen Maßnahme von Trainer Víctor Manuel Vucetich ausgewechselt wurde, verließ er ohne Genehmigung das Stadion. Im Rückspiel wurde er nicht berücksichtigt. Am Ende verlor sein Team deutlich im Finale gegen Santos Laguna. Im Juli 2015 wurde der Vertrag wieder aufgelöst. Fluminense Rio de Janeiro Am 11. Juli 2015 vermeldete der brasilianische Verein Fluminense Rio de Janeiro, dass Ronaldinho beim Klub einen Vertrag bis Dezember 2016 unterschrieben habe. Das Gastspiel bei seinem neuen Verein verlief aber erneut nur äußerst kurz. Nach neun Einsätzen ohne Torerfolg einigten sich Klub und Spieler bereits Ende September 2015 auf eine Auflösung des Vertrages. Fluminense-Sportdirektor Mario Bittencourt erklärte den frühzeitigen Abschied so: "Ronaldinho bat um ein Treffen. Er sagte uns respektvoll, dass er sich nicht in der Lage fühle, so gut zu spielen, wie er es will." Im Dezember 2015 unterschrieb Ronaldinho einen neuen Vertrag für zwei Spiele im Januar 2016. Dabei spielte Ronaldinho vom 10. bis 20. Januar für Fluminense beim Florida Cup. Der Vertrag diente reinen Marketingzwecken, sodass Ronaldinho anschließend nicht mehr für Fluminense auflief. Futsal in Indien Im Juli 2016 nahm Ronaldinho für die Goa 5′s, ein Futsalteam aus dem indischen Bundesstaat Goa, neben den ehemaligen Spielern Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Míchel Salgado und Hernán Crespo sowie dem Futsalspieler Falcão an der zweiwöchigen Premierensaison der Premier Futsal League Teil. Nachdem Ronaldinho im ersten Spiel noch torlos geblieben war, erzielte er beim 7:2-Sieg im zweiten Spiel gegen das Team aus Bangalore fünf Treffer. Nach seinem zweiten Spiel verließ Ronaldinho Indien wieder, da er zum Markenbotschafter der Sommer-Paralympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro ernannt worden war. Er wurde für die restlichen drei Spiele durch Cafu ersetzt. Nationalmannschaft Im September 1997 gewann Ronaldinho mit seinem Heimatland die U-17-Weltmeisterschaft. Am 26. Juni 1999 gab Ronaldinho gegen Lettland sein Debüt in der brasilianischen A-Nationalmannschaft. Seinen ersten Länderspieltreffer erzielte er bereits in seinem zweiten Länderspiel am 30. Juni 1999 gegen Venezuela. Im Juli 1999 gewann er mit Brasilien die Copa América und wurde im August 1999 Zweiter beim Confed-Cup. Bei der WM 2002 gewann Ronaldinho mit der brasilianischen Auswahl den Weltmeistertitel. Er ist damit der bisher einzige Spieler, der U-17-Weltmeister und Weltmeister mit der A-Nationalmannschaft wurde. Seine Auftritte bei der WM-Endrunde brachten dem damals 22-Jährigen große internationale Aufmerksamkeit ein, obwohl er ursprünglich nicht zu den großen Stars der Weltmeister-Elf gehörte. Er nahm an fünf Spielen teil und schoss zwei Tore. Im Viertelfinale gegen England (2:1) bereitete er den Ausgleichstreffer durch einen sehenswerten Sprint vor und ihm gelang der spektakuläre Siegtreffer, als er den englischen Torhüter David Seaman mit einem direkten Freistoß aus großer Distanz bezwang. Im Halbfinale gegen die Türkei war Ronaldinho wegen seines Feldverweises im Viertelfinale gesperrt. Im Finale gegen Deutschland, das durch zwei Tore von Ronaldo entschieden wurde, stand er jedoch wieder in der Startformation. 2005 gewann Ronaldinho mit der brasilianischen Nationalmannschaft den Confed-Cup 2005. Im Finale besiegten sie am 29. Juni 2005 Argentinien mit 4:1. Ronaldinho trug mit einem Tor zum Sieg bei. Bei der WM 2006 enttäuschte Ronaldinho gemeinsam mit einer insgesamt schwachen brasilianischen Nationalmannschaft, die bereits im Viertelfinale gegen den späteren Finalisten Frankreich ausschied. Ronaldinho nahm an den Olympischen Spielen 2000 und 2008 teil, erzielte dabei drei Tore und gewann 2008 die Bronzemedaille. 2000 schied er mit Brasilien im Viertelfinale gegen den späteren Olympiasieger Kamerun aus. Er konnte dabei zwar in der Nachspielzeit die Führung Kameruns ausgleichen, in der Verlängerung gelang Kamerun aber das 2:1. Auch 2008 erfolgte das Ausscheiden gegen den späteren Olympiasieger Argentinien. Aufgrund seiner seltenen Spieleinsätze und seiner mangelhaften sportlichen Form beim AC Mailand wurde er nicht für den Confed-Cup 2009 nominiert. Trotz deutlicher Leistungssteigerung in der Saison 2009/10 und prominenter Fürsprecher wie Pelé, Romário und Brasiliens Staatspräsident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva wurde Ronaldinho auch für die WM 2010 nicht in die Seleção berufen. Er wurde von Nationaltrainer Carlos Dunga lediglich auf Abruf nominiert. Am 29. Oktober 2010 wurde Ronaldinho vom neuen Nationaltrainer Mano Menezes für das Freundschaftsspiel am 17. November 2010 gegen Argentinien nominiert. Bis zur Copa América 2011 in Argentinien folgte allerdings keine Nominierung mehr, sodass Ronaldinho auch die Copa América, wie die WM 2010, aufgrund einer Nichtberücksichtigung des Trainers Dunga verpasste. Nach fast einem Jahr ohne Berücksichtigung nominierte ihn Menezes für das Testspiel gegen Ghana am 5. September 2011, in dem er ebenso zum Einsatz kam wie in den Spielen um die erstmals seit 1976 wieder ausgetragene Copa Roca gegen Argentinien am 14. und 28. September 2011. Am 7. Oktober 2011 zog er mit seinem 92. Länderspiel mit Pelé und Roberto Rivelino gleich und gehört damit zu den 11 Spielern mit den meisten Länderspielen für Brasilien. Am 14. März 2012 wurde Ronaldinho von Menezes in das vorläufige 52-köpfige Aufgebot zu den Olympischen Spielen 2012 berufen. Hierbei sind allerdings nur U-23-Auswahlen zugelassen, die mit maximal drei älteren Athleten verstärkt werden dürfen. Am 6. Februar 2013 wurde er vor dem Spiel gegen England für sein 100. Länderspiel in der Seleção geehrt. Davon wurden aber einige Spiele nicht gegen von der FIFA anerkannte A-Nationalmannschaften bestritten. In bisher 97 offiziellen Länderspielen erzielte er 33 Länderspieltreffer. Sein bisher letztes Länderspiel bestritt er am 25. April 2013 in Belo Horizonte gegen Chile. Für die WM 2014 wurde er von Luiz Felipe Scolari nicht berücksichtigt und auch sein Nachfolger Dunga verzichtete bisher auf Ronaldinho. |
G;|Leonid von Optina (russisch Лев Оптинский; * 1768 in Karatschew im Gouvernement Orjol, Russisches Kaiserreich; † 11. Oktoberjul./ 23. Oktober 1841greg. im Optina-Kloster im Gouvernement Kaluga), mit bürgerlichem Namen Lew Danilowitsch Nagolkin (russisch Лев Данилович Наголкин), war ein Mönch und Seelsorger. Er wird in der russisch-orthodoxen Kirche als Heiliger verehrt und zählt zu den Starzen. Auch in der evangelischen Kirche in Deutschland gilt er als denkwürdiger Glaubenszeuge.  Alle Datumsangaben in diesem Kapitel richten sich nach dem damals in Russland üblichen julianischen Kalender. Jugend 1784 wurde Lew Nagolkin Kaufmannsgehilfe. In diesem Beruf reiste er durch Russland. So lernte er, mit verschiedenen Leuten umzugehen. Suche nach Einsamkeit 1797 erfolgte sein Eintritt in die Mönchskolonie Optina in Kaluga. Selbst dort erschien ihm das Leben zu unruhig. So ging er 1799 in die Einsiedelei zur weißen Klippe nahe Orjol, die von Abt Wassili Kischkin geleitet wurde. Dieser war zuvor Mönch auf dem Berg Athos. Hier lernte Nagolkin Gehorsam, Geduld und verschiedene Exerzitien. 1801 erhielt er von Kischkin die Tonsur und wurde unter dem Ordensnamen Leonid Mönch. Am 22. Dezember 1801 wurde er zum Diakon und am 24. Dezember zum Priester geweiht. Durch seine Pflichterfüllung wurde Leonid zum Vorbild für seine Brüder. Dadurch wurden seine Oberen auf ihn aufmerksam. Für gewisse Zeit weilte Leonid auch im Kloster Cholnsk. Dort traf er Theodore, einen Schüler des Païssi Welitschkowski (1722–1794). Der etwa zehn Jahre ältere Theodore stammte ebenfalls aus Karatschew. Von ihm lernte Leonid viel über geistliches Ringen und wie aus orthodoxer Sicht die Gnade des Heiligen Geistes zu erlangen sei. Leonid wurde ungewöhnlich schnell sehr prominent. So wurde er 1804 von Bischof Dorotheus von Orlow und Swensk zum Abt der Einsiedelei gewählt; er verließ Theodore nur ungern. 1805 ging Theodore allerdings ebenfalls in die Einsiedelei. Die Gespräche mit ihm brachten Leonid noch mehr Fortschritt in seinem geistlichen Leben. Theodore, der sich nach Einsamkeit sehnte, erhielt die Erlaubnis, mit seinem Schüler Kleopas etwa eine Meile entfernt seine Zelle einzurichten. 1808 legte Leonid das Amt des Abtes wieder nieder und schloss sich Theodore und Kleopas an, um sich noch mehr dem Gebet und jeder Art von Enthaltsamkeit widmen zu können. Er erhielt den Rang eines Schema-Mönchs und den Namen Lev (oft übersetzt mit Leo). Die Berühmtheit der drei Brüder sorgte für zahlreiche Besucher und Ablenkungen vom geistlichen Ringen. So zog sich Theodore 1809 in das Neue Seekloster zurück, dann sandte ihn Metropolit Ambrosius von St. Petersburg in die Einsiedelei auf der Palei-Insel. 1812 zog Theodore dann in die Allerheiligeneinsiedelei des abgelegenen Klosters Walaam im Ladogasee, wo er wieder mit Leonid und Kleopas zusammentraf. Kleopas starb 1816. Leonid und Theodore zogen in das Kloster des Hl. Alexander von Swir. Zar Alexander I. besuchte 1820 das Kloster, um die berühmten Mönche zu treffen. Sie beantworteten seine Fragen so kurz wie möglich, um nicht geschwätzig zu erscheinen. Als er um ihren Segen bat, erwiderte ihm Theodore, dass er kein geweihter Mönch sei. Der Zar verbeugte sich und ging. Leonid folgte immer weiter dem Weg des Starzentums. Dies bedeutete, dass er sich immer mehr der Buße und Askese hingab und das Alleinsein mit Gott suchte. Dies und der Tod Theodores am 7. April 1822, dem Freitag nach Ostern, weckten in ihm den Wunsch, das Kloster zu verlassen und einen einsameren Ort zu suchen. Erzbischof Ambrosius Podobedew von Kasan war bereit, ihn dafür in seiner Diözese aufzunehmen; ferner wurde er in die Orlow-Diözese eingeladen, um dort in der Ploschanski-Einsiedelei zu leben; außerdem wurde ihm vom Mönch Moses und dem Bischof Philaret von Kaluga angeboten, in das Optina-Kloster zurückzukehren. Begegnung mit Makari, Leonid als Starez Aber erst 1828 wurde es Leonid gestattet, sein Kloster zu verlassen. So gelangte er mit seinen Schülern zunächst in die genannte Einsiedelei, wo er den Mönch Makari Iwanow traf. Dieser war ebenfalls Schüler eines Starez, der seinerseits Schüler von Païssi Welitschkowski war. Nach dem Tod dieses Starez fühlte sich Makari verwaist und betete zu Gott um einen erfahrenen geistigen Führer. Als Leonid eintraf, betrachtete Makari seine Gebete als erhört. Leonid lebte nun völlig abgeschieden und ungestört tief im Wald. Er galt jetzt als großer Starez. Dieser Titel, der in etwa „ehrwürdiger Greis“ bedeutet, wurde für Menschen verwendet, die sich jahrelang im völligen Bewusstsein der Gegenwart Gottes in völliger Einsamkeit befanden und ständig das Jesusgebet beteten. Die Enthaltsamkeit sollte sie zu einem möglichst einfachen Denken und geistlicher Reife führen, um andere beraten und zu Gott führen zu können. Diesen Menschen wurde mit besonderer Achtung begegnet, ohne dass damit ein besonderes Amt verbunden gewesen wäre. Die häufigen Ortswechsel Leonids in dieser Lebensphase sind nicht auf einen unsteten Charakter Leonids zurückzuführen, sondern den Umständen geschuldet. Das Starzentum war im klösterlichen Leben des 18. und 19. Jahrhunderts in Russland in Vergessenheit geraten und wurde für eine Neuerung gehalten, was zu Missverständnissen, Verleumdungen, Neid und regelrechter Verfolgung führte. Dies sollte sich besonders in Leonids letzten Lebensjahren zeigen. Starez in Optina Im April 1829 folgte Leonid schließlich der Einladung nach Optina, wohin er jetzt mit sechs Schülern zurückkehrte. Sie erhielten Einsiedlerklausen, Leonid nahe der Imkerei, seine Schüler an anderen Orten. Leonids Ankunft leitete ein neues Kapitel in der Geschichte Optinas ein, da er mit Makari, der weiterhin in Briefkontakt mit ihm stand, bis er 1834 ebenfalls in eine Klause dieses Klosters zog, das Starzentum in Optina einführte. Dies bedeutete, dass keine Entscheidung mehr ohne sein Wissen und seinen Segen getroffen wurde. Jeden Abend besuchten ihn die Mönche, um ihre geistlichen Bedürfnisse zu besprechen und ihre Sünden in Gedanken, Worten und Werken zu bekennen. Er bot ihnen Trost in ihren Sorgen, Rat in ihrem geistlichen Ringen und Hilfe, ihre Probleme zu lösen. Viele Menschen aus allen sozialen Schichten, sowohl aus städtischem als auch aus ländlichem Umfeld, suchten Leonids Rat, er wurde weit über Optina hinaus berühmt. Er konnte ihnen in ihren geistlichen Anfechtungen aufgrund der Erfahrungen seiner dreißigjährigen Askese helfen. Bisweilen soll er auch ihre körperlichen Gebrechen geheilt haben, indem er sie mit Öl aus der Lampe salbte, die stets vor der Wladimir-Marienikone in seiner Zelle brannte. Auch bildete er weitere Schüler aus, so wie er von Theodore ausgebildet worden war und dieser wiederum von Païssi Welitschkowski. Die Führung als Schüler durch einen Älteren galt in der Orthodoxie als sicherer und verlässlicher Weg zur Erlösung. Der Ursprung dieser Tradition lag in Ägypten und Palästina und gelangte über den Berg Athos schließlich nach Russland. Durch Leonid wurde das Starzentum weithin bekannt. Makari unterstützte Leonid bei seiner Korrespondenz und der geistlichen Betreuung der Mönche und der Besucher Leonids. Leonid hielt sich an die Weisheit des Johannes Klimakos, dass ein Lehrer keinen Lohn erwarten könne, wenn er seine Schüler nicht korrigierte, dass er sich ungerecht verhielte, wenn er die Möglichkeit, einen Schüler auf seinem Weg ein Stück weiter zu führen, nicht nutzte und dass es auch bei den Fleißigsten und Geduldigsten zu Rückschlägen führe, wenn sie keinen Tadel von ihrem Lehrer erhielten. Diese Ansichten spiegelten sich auch in seinem Umgang mit Makari. So ist eine Situation überliefert, in der Makari vom Abt Moses gebeten wurde, einige Novizen bei der Aufnahme zu protegieren. Makari fasste die Bitte als Befehl auf, verbeugte sich und ging zu Leonid, der gerade von zahlreichen Ratsuchenden umgeben war, um ihm zu berichten, warum Moses ihn hergerufen habe. Leonid blickte ihn ernst an und fragte: „Was hast du getan? Hast du dem zugestimmt?“ Makari antwortete: „Ich habe fast zugestimmt, oder besser gesagt: Ich habe nicht gewagt, zu widersprechen.“ Leonid entgegnete: „Das ist typisch für deinen Stolz.“ und maßregelte ihn mit erhobener Stimme, als wäre er sehr wütend. Makari verbeugte sich lange Zeit und bat um Vergebung. Die Anwesenden verfolgten erstaunt das Geschehen. Nachdem Leonid ausgeredet hatte, sagte Makari: „Vergib mir, Vater. Gibst du mir deinen Segen, es abzulehnen?“ Leonid antwortete: „Wie kannst Du es ablehnen? Du kannst es nicht ablehnen, die Sache ist geklärt.“ Andererseits zeigte sich in vielen Situationen Leonids Zuneigung und Respekt gegenüber Makari, da er ihm viel Vertrauen entgegenbrachte und ihn zu seinem Helfer und Mitarbeiter machte. Leonid führte das Starzentum in zwei weiteren Klöstern der Kaluga-Diözese ein. Führung von Nonnen Daneben führte er auch einige Nonnen aus anderen Diözesen. In den Frauenklöstern in Belew, Sewsk und Baryssau waren einige seiner Schülerinnen auf ihrem geistlichen Weg fortgeschrittener als andere. Diese wurden Starzinnen für die anderen Schwestern, teils während, teils nach Leonids Lebenszeit. Beschwerden über Leonid In den Jahren 1835 und 1836 beschwerten sich einige Personen, darunter auch Mönche, die mit dem Konzept des Starzentums nicht einverstanden waren, da sie es in Unkenntnis seiner langen Tradition als eine Neuerung ansahen, beim Bischof über Leonid. Die Beschwerden waren wenig erfolgreich. So besuchte Bischof Gabriel von Kaluga Optina und zeigte sich Abt Moses' Politik gegenüber günstig eingestellt. Er wies die Unzufriedenen vor allen Brüdern zurecht und befahl ihnen, sich zu bessern. Die Unzufriedenheit bei einigen Mönchen blieb, dies hing mit der großen Zahl der Besucher zusammen, die, wie sie meinten, die Ruhe des Klosters störten, wie sie in Berichten an den Bischof schrieben. Nikolaus, der neue Bischof von Kaluga, ignorierte die Beschwerden zunächst. Dann erreichte ihn eine anonyme falsche Anschuldigung gegen Moses und Leonid. So befahl der Bischof aus unbekannten Gründen, Leonid möge seine Zelle nahe der Imkerei verlassen und in das Kloster ziehen. Ferner verbot er Leonid, Laien zu empfangen, weder weibliche noch männliche. Da keine Zelle im Kloster verfügbar war, zog Leonid stattdessen in eine Einsiedlerklause. 1836 bekam Leonid die formelle Anordnung, in das Kloster zu ziehen. Abt Moses und Antonius, der Vorsteher der Einsiedelei, hatten keine Wahl. Sie wussten, das Leonid unschuldig war, mussten aber dem Bischof gehorchen. Ablösung durch Makari und Lebensende Ebenfalls 1836 übernahm Makari die Aufgabe des Vaters des Klosters. Dieses Amt hatte er bereits für über sieben Jahre im Konvent in Sewsk innegehabt. Er unterwarf sich aber weiterhin in allen Dingen freiwillig Leonid, der Makari hingegen mittlerweile mehr als Freund und Mitarbeiter denn als Schüler betrachtete. 1837 besuchte Metropolit Filaret I. Amfiteatrow von Kiew (Amtszeit 1837–1858) in Begleitung von Bischof Nikolaus von Kaluga Optina. Der Metropolit kannte Leonid aus seiner Zeit im Kloster zur weißen Klippe und zeigte seinen Respekt gegenüber Leonid und Abt Moses. Die Gegner der beiden waren darüber bestürzt. Selbst Nikolaus begann daraufhin, den Beschwerden weniger Gewicht beizumessen, und Leonids Position festigte sich. In seinen letzten Lebensjahren kam noch eine weitere Prüfung auf Leonid zu. So wurde er 1841 in Streitigkeiten unter einigen Nonnen im Kreuzerhöhungskonvent in Belew verwickelt, die zu seinen Schülerinnen gehörten. Die Zufriedenheit von Äbtissin Epaphrodite mit den Fortschritten Mutter Anthias, die unter Leonids Führung zur Starzin geworden war, und einiger ihr nahestehender Nonnen in der Ablegung ihres eigenen Willens, der Reinigung ihrer Gedanken und dem Kampf gegen ihre Begierden erregte den Neid einiger Schwestern. Eine von ihnen beschwerte sich bei ihrem geistlichen Vater und verbreitete Gerüchte über Anthia und ihre Gefährtinnen. Der Vater war bereits vorher gegen Anthia und ihre geistliche Führung durch Leonid eingenommen. Er begann ebenfalls, Anschuldigungen und Verleumdungen gegen Leonid zu verbreiten, da er das Starzentum ablehnte. Bischof Damascenus von Tula hörte von dem Gerücht, der Priester habe eine neue Ketzerei im Konvent von Belew aufgedeckt, und lud ihn und Anthia vor, um sie zu befragen. Er glaubte dem Priester, und beschloss, zu handeln. So kam es im Februar 1841 auf Anordnung des Bischofs zum Ausschluss der Starzin und einer weiteren Schwester aus dem Konvent wegen angeblich abweichlerischer Meinungen. Leonid war damit als Unruhestifter und Rebell gegen jegliche Autorität gebrandmarkt, was er mit Geduld ertrug. Erneut wurde er angewiesen, seine Zelle bei der Imkerei zu verlassen und in eine Zelle zu ziehen, die möglichst weit von den Toren des Klosters entfernt liegen sollte. Auch der Empfang von Laien wurde ihm wieder verboten. Im September 1841 verschlechterte sich Leonids Gesundheitszustand; er war fünf Wochen lang krank. Er lehnte es jedoch ab, sich von einem Arzt untersuchen zu lassen oder Medikamente zu sich zu nehmen. Am 15. September erhielt er die Krankensalbung und bereitete sich auf seinen Tod vor. Er verabschiedete sich von seinen Brüdern und segnete sie. Auch gab er jedem von ihnen ein Erinnerungsstück, beispielsweise eine Ikone oder ein Buch. Am 28. September empfing er die Kommunion (insgesamt zwölf Mal in den letzten zwei Wochen seines Lebens) und nahm danach keine Nahrung und nur noch wenig Wasser zu sich. Er bat darum, dass die Liturgie für die Abreise der Seele für ihn gelesen werden möge. Die Brüder reagierten besorgt, Leonid meinte aber, dass sie diese Liturgie wohl mehrmals lesen müssten. Tatsächlich wurde sie bis zu seinem Tod acht Mal für ihn gelesen. Die schriftliche Intervention Metropolit Filarets beim Bischof für Leonid führte am 4. Oktober 1841 zur Wiederaufnahme der ausgeschlossenen Schwestern; der Bischof kam zu der Überzeugung, der Priester habe in blindem Eifer gehandelt. Ab dem 6. Oktober war Leonid bettlägerig und bat seine Brüder, um eine Verkürzung seiner Leiden zu beten. Am Morgen des 11. Oktober 1841 empfing er das letzte Mal die Kommunion und erhielt Besuch von Basil Bragusin, der in der Region als sogenannter Narr in Christo bekannt war. Bragusin soll den Tod des Starez vorhergesehen haben und war über eine Strecke von 180 km angereist, um sich von ihm zu verabschieden. Um 10 Uhr morgens begann Leonid, sich mehrmals, gefolgt von den Worten „Ehre sei Gott“, zu bekreuzigen. Danach schwieg er für längere Zeit. Dann sagte er zu den Umstehenden: „Jetzt wird die Gnade Gottes mit mir sein.“ Nach etwa einer Stunde soll er trotz seiner Schmerzen sehr fröhlich gewirkt haben, wohl aufgrund der Erwartungen, die er in die Ewigkeit setzte. Abends verabschiedete er sich von den Anwesenden und segnete sie still. Bis auf einen Schüler verließen sie den Raum. Leonid starb schließlich um 19 Uhr 30. |
G;|Karl Friedrich Franciscus von Steinmetz (* 26. Oktober 1768 in Namslau; † 11. März 1837 in Potsdam) war ein preußischer Generalleutnant und Kartograf. Er war der Onkel des Generalfeldmarschalls Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz.  Herkunft Er war der Sohn von Johann Werner von Steinmetz (* 2. Mai 1727; † 24. November 1778), gebürtig aus der Landgrafschaft Hessen-Kassel und der Ritterschaft des Eichsfeldes angehörend, und der aus Breslau stammenden Maria Magdalena, geborene Held (1736–1796). Sie bekamen vier Kinder, zwei Söhne und zwei Töchter. Sein Vater kämpfte im Siebenjährigen Krieg im preußischen Heer. Nach mehreren Verwundungen wurde er in ein Garnisons-Bataillon versetzt. Bei Ausbruch des Bayerischen Erbfolgekrieges erhielt er die Erlaubnis, ein Freibataillon aufzustellen und als Oberstleutnant zu befehligen. Am 24. November 1778 fiel er an der Spitze seines Bataillons in einem Gefecht bei Komeise in der Nähe von Jägerndorf. In Anerkennung seiner Verdienste teilte der König Friedrich II. persönlich der Witwe mit Bedauern den Verlust an und bewilligte ihr eine Pension. Zugleich befahl er, dass die zwei Söhne im Kadettenkorps aufgenommen und erzogen werden sollen. Zu Ehren des Vaters wurde ihm ein Gedicht gewidmet, dass in Steinmetz Wohnung hing und folgenden Wortlaut hat. Ausbildung Steinmetz wurde zu Hause von einem Hofmeister unterrichtet und kam am 30. September 1781, wie es der Befehl des Königs war, in die Kadettenanstalt Berlin. Der Ruhm des Vaters, die Anerkennung seiner Verdienste durch den König, so wie die häufigen Anfragen hoher Offiziere der alten Armee und selbst des späteren Königs Friedrich Wilhelm III., ob er der Sohn des bei Komeise gebliebenen Oberstleutnant sei, waren sein Ansporn in die Fußstapfen seines Vaters zu treten und ein rechtschaffender Offizier zu werden. Er entsprach allen Anforderungen im wissenschaftlichen Bereich, aber nicht den physischen, da es ihm an Körpergröße fehlte. So wurde er bei allen Vorstellungen für den Eintritt in das Heer zurückgewiesen. Im März 1787 kam Steinmetz nach Potsdam als Kadett in das Bataillon Königs Grenadier-Garde des Generals von Rohdich. Am 15. Juni desselben Jahres aber wurde er, wegen eines für ihn vorteilhaften Berichtes seines Kommandeurs General von Rohdich, nach Treuenbrietzen in das Füsilierbataillon von Bork versetzt. Dort wurde er, ohne vorher Junker gewesen zu sein, vom Kadetten zum Secondeleutnant. Das außerdienstliche Leben des Offizierskorps in der Garnison Treuenbrietzen, wo General von Scholten 1781 eine Akademie und dazu die Gesellschaft der Freunde der Wissenschaft und des guten Geschmacks gegründet hatte, förderte seine Neigungen mit der Beschäftigung von Wissenschaft, Malerei und Musik. So lernte er perfekt Violine zu spielen. Dieses Leben wurde 1790 durch eine Mobilmachung mit einem anschließenden Marsch an die Grenze von Böhmen und 1791 mit einer zweiten Mobilmachung und anschließendem Marsch nach Pommern unterbrochen. Hier machte Steinmetz seine ersten militärischen Erfahrungen außerhalb der Garnison. Feldzug 1794 Im Mai des Jahres 1794 marschierte sein Bataillon im Feldzug dieses Jahres an den Rhein, ohne dabei in nennenswerte kriegerische Handlungen verwickelt zu werden. Dafür bekam er die Gelegenheit, einen großen Teil von Deutschland kennenzulernen. Im Winter 1794 stand seine Einheit bei Mainz und er fand neben dem militärischen Dienst noch Muse, sich den Künsten hinzugeben. So sah er in Frankfurt Die Zauberflöte, die ihn inspirierte, selbst Flöte blasen zu lernen, da seine Violine nur schwer zu befördern war. Mit dem Basler Frieden 1795 gehörte sein Bataillon zu den Demarkationstruppen im Herzogtum Westfalen und wurde im Winter 1795 auf 1796 weitläufig bei Feuchtwangen stationiert. Vermessung des Herzogtums Westfalen Von 1796–1805 war er, mit einigen Unterbrechungen, mit der von General von Le Coq geleiteten Vermessung des Herzogtums Westfalen beschäftigt. Hier konnte er nun zum ersten Mal sein geistiges Wissen und Können anwenden. So waren die Vermessungen der Grafschaften Rietberg und Steinfurt sowie der Fürstentümer Paderborn und Waldeck sein Werk. Den Winter 1799 verbrachte er in Ringenberg, wo er sich schriftstellerisch in statistischen und militärischen Schriften, hauptsächlich über Westfalen, betätigte. Über diese Schriften wurde später in der Vereinigung Militärische Gesellschaft, deren Mitglied Steinmetz war, diskutiert. 1800 ließ er seine Familie nachkommen und begann damit, seine Töchter, so wie ihm Zeit blieb, zu unterrichten. In der Befürchtung einer britischen Landung an der Nordseeküste, wurden Truppenkorps zusammengezogen und so kam Steinmetz über Lingen (Ems) und Aurich ins Harlingerland. Doch schon im Juli konnte er zur Vermessung zurückkehren. In Warburg beschäftigt, wurde er 1804 nach Potsdam zum Generalstabsexamen berufen. Wissend, dass für ihn mit einer so großen Familie und keinem Vermögen der Eintritt in den Generalstab nicht annehmbar sei, unterwarf er sich dennoch dem Examen und bestand. Feldzüge 1806/12 Als im Herbst 1805 die Vermessung abgeschlossen war, wurde er nach Hildesheim versetzt. Doch kaum da angekommen musste Steinmetz, inzwischen zum Premier-Leutnant befördert, die Formierung eines Depots für sein Bataillon in Magdeburg übernehmen und am 1. Januar 1806 wurde er, im Rang eines Hauptmanns, als Vize-Kommandant in den Stab der Berliner Kadettenanstalt versetzt. Einen Monat später verstarb seine Frau. Da im Oktober 1806 infolge des Feldzuges von 1806 Berlin von den napoleonischen Truppen besetzt war, wurden die Kadetten nach Königsberg verlegt. Steinmetz erhielt den Befehl in Fischhausen das 2. Pommersche Reserve-Bataillon aufzustellen mit dem er den zur Sicherung des königlichen Hauses nach Memel rückte. Als im März 1807 die Belagerung Kolbergs bevorstand, sollte er mit seinem Bataillon die Besatzung der Festung verstärken. Damit seine noch unerfahrenen Soldaten Erfahrungen sammeln konnten, leitete Steinmetz die Einschiffung am 23. März nach Pommern mit einem Manöver ein. Am 26. April 1807 in Kolberg, das seit dem 14. März belagert wurde, mit vierzehn Offizieren und 540 Mann angekommen, wurde sein Bataillon am 29. April ins Gefecht geschickt. Es übernahm die Verteidigung eines Teils der Lauenburger Vorstadt und des Cörliner Dammes. Am 17. Mai trug es zur Wiedereroberung der Wolfsbergschanze bei. Nach dem Tod von Waldenfels am 15. Juni, ernannte der Festungskommandant Major von Gneisenau Steinmetz zum zweiten Kommandanten. Gneisenau schrieb an den König: Nach der erfolgreichen Abwehr der Belagerung wurde er mit der Kabinettsorder als zweiter Kommandant bestätigt und mit dem Orden Pour le Mérite ausgezeichnet. Am 16. August 1807 wurde er, nach Gneisenaus Abgang zur Heeres-Neuorganisation, vom König zum Kommandanten der Festung ernannt. Der König schrieb am 25. Juli aus Memel an Gneisenau: Sein Bataillon wurde als das 1. Bataillon in das Leibgrenadierregiment übernommen. Nach seiner Ernennung zum Kommandanten, wurde er zum Major befördert. Seit dem Ende der Belagerung kamen immer mehr Streitigkeiten zwischen den Bürgern und dem Militär, so wurden zum Beispiel Soldaten in Wohnhäusern untergebracht, auf und auch Joachim Nettelbeck äußerte sich kritisch über einzelne Begebenheiten, Personen und Offiziere. Als sich dann doch einzelne Offiziere Dinge zu Schulden kommen lassen hatten, steigerte sich der Unwille zur Versöhnung beider Seiten. Nettelbeck schrieb im November an Gneisenau: Steinmetz versuchte das Problem zu lösen, er war aber ohne Einfluss auf die Bürgerschaft und bekam in seiner militärischen Stellung keine Hilfe von seinem Vorgesetzten General von Blücher. Sei es nun, dass der General ihm damals abgeneigt war, oder wie er dazu meinte, gelöst wurden sie dadurch aber nicht. Um die schuldigen Offiziere zu bestrafen schickte er einen Antrag an Blücher, der aber die Genehmigung mit den Worten, verweigerte. In der Garnison wurde dem Alkohol zugesprochen, so dass Steinmetz vom König zur Verantwortung gezogen wurde. Gneisenau schrieb daraufhin an alle Battaillonskommandeure harte Worte, die auch wirkten. Da die Zeitungen immer mehr Berichte über die Streitigkeiten in Kolberg druckten, schickte der König im Juni 1808 eine Kommission nach Kolberg. Die entschied am 1. Juli nach eingehender Untersuchung für das Militär und gegen die Bürger. Fortan entspannte sich das Verhältnis und Steinmetz und Gneisenau wurden als Mitglied in die Bürgerschaft aufgenommen. Im September 1808, seines Amtes als Kommandant müde geworden, beantragte er seine Versetzung, die auch noch vor Jahresende erfolgte. Im Juni 1810 bekam er das Kommando über das Colbergsche Infanterie-Regiment, welches die Kontinentalsperre vom Peenestrom bis nach Rügenwalde aufrechterhalten sollte. Zu Beginn des Russlandfeldzuges 1812 wurde ihm das Kommando über das, aus dem 2. und dem Füsilierbataillon des 2. Grenadier-Regimentes und dem 1. Bataillon des Colbergsche Infanterie-Regimentes, neu zusammengestellte Infanterie Feld-Regiment Nr. 3 übertragen und der Brigade des Oberstleutnants von Horn unterstellt. Am 19. März 1812 marschierte das Regiment nach Russland ab. Das Regiment kämpfte erfolgreich in zahlreichen Gefechten in den russischen Ostseeprovinzen. Dafür wurde Steinmetz mit dem Roten Adlerorden III. Klasse ausgezeichnet. Am 30. Dezember trennte sich das Füsilierbataillon und ging über Memel nach Stargard, während Steinmetz am 1. Januar 1813 mit den beiden Musketierbataillonen über Tilsit ging und traf am 11. März in Stargard ein. Das Regiment wurde am 10. März 1813 wieder aufgelöst. Feldzug 1813 Nach der Konvention von Tauroggen kam er am 17. März 1813 mit dem Korps von Yorck in Berlin an. Von Breslau aus, ernannte ihn der König zum Oberstleutnant und schickte ihn als Avantgarde, welche aus preußischen und russischen Truppen bestand, unter General von Kleist nach Wittenberg. Als Kleist mit seiner Avantgarde abberufen wurde, blieb Steinmetz mit nur zwei Bataillonen Infanterie, einem Eskadron Kavallerie und einer reitenden Batterie Artillerie zurück. Er hatte den Befehl die Vorstädte zu räumen. Aus Furcht dem Feind damit jedoch seine Schwäche zu zeigen, behielt er mit seinen wenigen Truppen die gedehnte Stellung bei. Durch Truppenbewegungen, die die Kavallerie und Artillerie durchführen musste, täuschte er dem Feind eine viel größere Truppenanzahl vor. So konnte er Wittenberg, drei Tage, bis zu seiner Ablösung, gegen einen zahlenmäßig überlegenen Feind halten. Am 28. April kämpfte er im Gefecht von Halle, wo er von Kleist zum Kommandanten der Stadt ernannt wurde und am 2. Mai in der Schlacht bei Großgörschen, wo er die Lücke zwischen dem Dorf Rhana und der Kavallerie füllte und gegen die Franzosen behauptete. Auf dem Rückzug der Verbündeten befehligte er, obwohl erst Oberstleutnant, als Chef der 1. Brigade vom Korps des General Yorks (Steinmetz führte in Vertretung des verwundeten Generals Hünerbein die Brigade) in das Gefecht bei Gersdorf. Das wäre eigentlich eine Aufgabe für einen General gewesen, doch Steinmetz konnte sich gegen die Franzosen behaupten. General Miloradowitsch, in seiner rechten Flanke bedroht, unterstützte ihn rechtzeitig vor der drohenden Niederlage mit russischen Truppen. Das brachte seiner Brigade und den russischen Truppen die alleinige Verfolgung der Franzosen bei. Als Nächstes kämpfte die Brigade in der Schlacht bei Bautzen. Hier hatte sie starke Verluste erlitten, Seine Brigade nahm auf dem Rückzug nach Schlesien auch noch an dem Gefecht bei Siergersdorf teil. Nach dem Waffenstillstand beteiligte er sich an dem Gefecht bei Jühnsdorf Danach leitete er die der Aufstellung des 2. Garde-Regiments zu Fuß und wurde zum Oberst und Brigadechef der 1. Grenadierbrigade im Yorkschen Korps ernannt. So unterstanden ihm nun vier Grenadier-, acht Landwehr-Bataillone, ein Kavallerie-Regiment und eine Batterie Artillerie. Weiterhin wurde er mit dem Eisernen Kreuz II. Klasse und dem Orden des Heiligen Wladimir III. Klasse ausgezeichnet. Auch in der Schlacht an der Katzbach hatte Steinmetz entscheidenden Anteil am Sieg. Als sich das russische Korps von Langeron in einer rückgängigen Bewegung befand, schlug er vor, sich dem Strom entgegenzustellen und die Langeronschen Truppen zum Anhalten zu bewegen. Das gelang, nachdem er mit zwei Bataillonen durch das hoch angeschwollene Wasser der Wütenden Neiße ging. In der Schlacht bei Wartenburg hatte er die Aufgabe mit seiner Brigade den ersten Angriff zu führen, der aber misslang. So stand die Brigade sieben Stunden unter Feuer und hatte 992 Tote und Verwundete. General York sagte darüber: aber in seinem Bericht an den König spricht er seine Bewunderung aus: In der Völkerschlacht bei Leipzig war seine Brigade am 16. Oktober 1813 als Reserve erst kurz vor Ende der Gefechte dieses Tages bei Möckern ins Schlachtengetümmel geworfen worden, aber auch ihm gelang es nicht den Ort vollständig einzunehmen. Er wurde durch eine Kugel im linken Armgelenk so schwer verwundet, dass er das Gefechtsfeld verlassen musste und zur Genesung nach Halle und später nach Berlin reiste. Damit war für ihn der Feldzug 1813, 1814 beendet. Im Dezember 1813 wurde Steinmetz zum Generalmajor ernannt und ihm wurde die Aufgabe erteilt, die Aufstellung der Landwehr zwischen Weser und Rhein, in der Stärke von 20 Bataillonen und 10 Eskatrons, zu vollenden. Feldzug 1815 Nach dem Ersten Pariser Frieden 1814 wurde Steinmetz zum Kommandanten der Zitadelle Wesel, unter Beibehaltung seines Brigadekommandos, ernannt und als ein neuer Krieg gegen Frankreich bevorstand, erhielt er die 1. Brigade im 1. Korps von General von Zieten. Mit dieser Brigade war er bereits einen Tag vor der Schlacht bei Ligny in Gefechte verwickelt worden. In der Schlacht bei Waterloo gelang ihm am 2. und 3. Juli 1815 mit seiner Brigade die Einnahme des Dorfes Issy. Für seine Leistungen in diesem Feldzug erhielt er das Eiserne Kreuz I. Klasse, das Eichenlaub zum Orden Pour le Mérite und in Wesel den Russischen Orden der Heiligen Anna I. Klasse und den Orden des Heiligen Georg III. Klasse. Lebensabend Nach dem Zweiten Pariser Frieden 1815 war er als Brigadechef in Trier in Garnison, aber wegen eines Magenleidens ersuchte er beim König seinen Abschied aus der Armee. Dieser wurde ihm am 16. März 1817 als Generalleutnant mit einer Pension von 1000 Talern bewilligt. Er verabschiedete sich in Trier von seinem Offizierskorps mit folgenden Worten: Als Pension bekam er die Einkünfte der Domäne Schönwalde bei Silberberg, deren Bewirtschaftung er übernahm und das er 1818 kaufte. Bereits 1821 verkaufte Steinmetz den Besitz wieder und zog in eine Villa nach Potsdam, wo er 1837 starb. Familie Steinmetz hatte sich am 17. Februar 1793 mit Magdalene Dorothee Vigny La Rosière (1776–1806) verheiratet. Sie war die Tochter des Generalmajors Grafen d' Heinze († 1810). Aus der Ehe gingen folgende Kinder hervor: Emilie Juliane Albertine (* 31. Dezember 1793 in Treuenbrietzen) Karoline (* 10. April 1796) Wilhelmine Julie Elisabeth Margarete (* 11. April 1801 in Ringenberg) Emma (* 28. Dezember 1803) Wilhelmine Franziska (* 1804; † 12. Juli 1806) Antoinette Wilhelmine (*/† 1806) |
G;|Jassir Arafat (* 24. August 1929 in Kairo, Ägypten; † 11. November 2004 in Clamart, Département Hauts-de-Seine, Frankreich), arabisch ياسر عرفات, DMG Yāsir ʿArafāt, ursprünglich محمد عبد الرحمن عبد الرؤوف عرفات القدوة الحسيني / Muḥammad ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ʿAbd ar-Raʾūf ʿArafāt al-Qudwa al-Ḥusainī, Kunya: أبو عمّار / Abū ʿAmmār, war ein palästinensischer Freiheitskämpfer, ￼, Guerillakämpfer, Politiker, Friedensnobelpreisträger und vom 12. Februar 1996 bis zu seinem Tod am 11. November 2004 Präsident der palästinensischen Autonomiegebiete. 1957 war er Mitbegründer und später Anführer der palästinensischen ￼￼Fatah￼￼. Arafats Unterstützung der irakischen Invasion Kuwaits hatte die Vertreibung der Palästinenser aus Kuwait 1991 zur Folge. Binnen weniger Tage mussten etwa 450.000 Palästinenser Kuwait verlassen. Dies und der Verlust wesentlicher Unterstützer in der arabischen Welt brachte Arafat 1993 dazu, im Namen der PLO Friedensverhandlungen mit Israel zu unternehmen, die zur gegenseitigen Anerkennung führten. 1994 erhielt er dafür gemeinsam mit Shimon Peres und Jitzchak Rabin den Friedensnobelpreis. Im Jahr 2000 verhandelte Arafat mit Israels damaligem Regierungschef Ehud Barak und dem damaligen Präsidenten der USA, Bill Clinton, erfolglos über die Gründung eines unabhängigen, palästinensischen Staates. Nach dem Scheitern von Camp David II unterstützte Arafat die Zweite Intifada, wodurch er in seinen letzten Lebensjahren vor allem außenpolitisch an Einfluss verlor. Erst nach dem Tod Arafats waren führende palästinensische Vertreter bereit, sich für Arafats Unterstützung Saddam Husseins und der Invasion in Kuwait zu entschuldigen.  Jassir Arafat wurde übereinstimmenden Erkenntnissen verschiedener Biographen zufolge in der ägyptischen Hauptstadt Kairo geboren. Arafat hingegen behauptete häufig, in Palästina geboren worden zu sein, wobei er im Laufe der Zeit widersprüchliche Angaben machte. Mal behauptete er, in der Altstadt Jerusalems geboren worden zu sein, mal im Gazastreifen. Sicher ist, dass sein Vater aus Gaza und seine Mutter aus einer angesehenen Jerusalemer Familie stammten. Sie hatten in den 1920er Jahren geheiratet und waren nach Kairo ausgewandert. Jassir war das sechste von sieben Kindern. Als er etwa vier Jahre alt war, starb seine Mutter. Um den Vater mit den sechs Kindern zu entlasten, nahm der Bruder der Mutter, Salim Abu Saud, Jassir und seinen jüngeren Bruder zu sich nach Jerusalem, das damals zum britischen Mandatsgebiet Palästina gehörte. Er lebte dort vier Jahre. Frühe Jahre Als er nach der erneuten Heirat seines Vaters nach Kairo zurückkehrte, besuchte er die Schule und später die Universität, an der er Elektrotechnik studierte. Eine Zeit lang beschäftigte er sich mit der jüdischen Kultur, hatte jüdische Bekannte und las zionistische Werke z. B. von Theodor Herzl. 1946 soll Arafat intensiven Kontakt mit Mohammed Amin al-Husseini, dem mit den deutschen Nationalsozialisten kollaborierenden Mufti von Jerusalem, gehabt haben, der in Ägypten Asyl gefunden hatte. Al-Husseini war ein entfernter Verwandter Arafats. Dass er jedoch der Onkel Arafats gewesen sei, ist eine Legende. Arafat engagierte sich nun aktiv in der arabischen Nationalbewegung in Palästina. Zu dieser Zeit war er ein Befürworter der militärischen Konfrontation und beschaffte Waffen, die ins Mandatsgebiet geschmuggelt wurden. In Kairo hatte sich Jassir Arafat mit Abd al-Qadir al-Husseini angefreundet, der die Einheiten palästinensischer Araber in der Region Jerusalem anführte. Als Arafat von Abdel Khader al-Husseinis Tod im Kampf am Kastel-Berg im April 1948 hörte, brach er sein Studium in Kairo ab und nahm aktiv am Krieg in Palästina teil. Arafat trat der Moslem-Bruderschaft bei, die im Gazastreifen und in der Schlacht bei Kfar Darom kämpfte. Als die ägyptische Armee am 15. Mai 1948 in den Palästinakrieg eingriff, wurde Arafat und seiner Einheit befohlen, abzuziehen. Dies war für ihn ein prägendes Erlebnis. Er beschuldigte später die arabischen Staaten des Verrates, weil sie den Palästinensern nicht geholfen hätten, die Schlacht zu gewinnen, und ihnen nicht erlaubt hätten, zu kämpfen. Die palästinensischen Araber erlitten eine militärische Niederlage gegen Israel. Etwa 750.000 Palästinenser wurden staatenlos und der bis heute andauernde Konflikt um die Selbstbestimmung der Palästinenser wurde zementiert. In den 1950er Jahren studierte Arafat an der Universität Kairo. 1952 gründete er die Generalunion Palästinensischer Studenten (GUPS), der er bis 1957 vorstand. Ende 1952 wurde er kurzzeitig nach einem gescheiterten Attentat auf den ägyptischen Präsidenten Gamal Abdel Nasser verhaftet. 1956 absolvierte er die Universität als Ingenieur und gründete die Union der Palästinensischen Hochschulabsolventen. Danach meldete er sich freiwillig zur ägyptischen Armee und kämpfte im Sueskrieg 1956 gegen Frankreich, Großbritannien und Israel. Er galt als Sprengstoffexperte und war Leutnant in der ägyptischen Armee. Danach ging er im selben Jahr nach Kuwait, wo er als Ingenieur arbeitete und ein erfolgreicher Bauunternehmer wurde. Gründung der Fatah 1957 gründete er in Kuwait zusammen mit Chalil al-Wazir (Abu Dschihad) die erste Zelle der Bewegung zur Befreiung Palästinas (al-Fatah), aus der 1959 die gleichnamige politische Partei hervorging. Ab 1958 war Arafat Vorstandsmitglied und ab 1968 Vorsitzender der Fatah. Durch seine aktive Teilnahme an der Schlacht von Karame 1968 begründete er seinen Heldenmythos und war ab 1969 Vorsitzender der PLO, die 1964 durch die Arabische Liga ins Leben gerufen worden war. Ende der 1960er Jahre wuchsen die Spannungen zwischen der PLO und der jordanischen Regierung; palästinensische Milizen (Fedayin) hatten faktisch einen Staat im Staate Jordanien etabliert und kontrollierten strategische Positionen wie die Öl-Raffinerien bei Zarqa. Jordanien betrachtete diese Umstände als eine wachsende Bedrohung seiner Souveränität und seiner Sicherheit und versuchte, die palästinensischen Milizen zu entwaffnen. Im Juni 1970 brachen nach einem fehlgeschlagenen palästinensischen Attentat auf den jordanischen König offene Kämpfe aus, die mit der Flucht der PLO aus Jordanien in den Libanon endeten. Wurde die Schlacht von Karame als erster historischer Sieg der PLO angesehen, so erlitt sie unter Arafats Führung 1970 mit dem Schwarzen September eine schwere Niederlage. Dieser musste zunächst nach Kairo, dann in den Libanon fliehen. Aufsehen erregte der historische Auftritt Arafats vor der UN-Vollversammlung am 13. November 1974, bei dem er in Uniform, mit der Kufiya und umgeschnalltem Pistolenholster eine Rede hielt, die von arabischen und kommunistischen Staaten mit Begeisterung aufgenommen wurde. In der Rede reklamierte Arafat den alleinigen Machtanspruch über Palästina für die PLO. Er sprach davon, eine Welt ohne Kolonialismus, Imperialismus, Neokolonialismus und ohne „Rassismus in all seinen Ausformungen, einschließlich des Zionismus“ schaffen zu wollen. Arafat vermied es, von Israel zu sprechen, um dem Staat jegliche Legitimität abzusprechen, und verwendete stattdessen den Begriff zionistische Entität. Den Zionismus stellte er in dieser Rede als eine imperialistische, kolonialistische und rassistische Ideologie dar, die – dezidiert reaktionär und diskriminierend – mit dem Antisemitismus gleichzusetzen sei. Ferner wiederholte er ein altes antisemitisches Stereotyp, indem er behauptete, der Zionismus wolle, dass die Juden ihren Heimatländern keine Treue entgegenbrächten und auf einer anderen (höheren) Ebene als ihre Mitbürger leben sollten. Er sprach der UNO das Recht ab, das unteilbare Heimatland der Palästinenser zu teilen, und wies damit den Teilungsbeschluss von 1947 zurück. Auch behauptete er, der Palästinakrieg von 1948 sei von Israel und nicht von den arabischen Staaten begonnen worden. Die PLO erhielt als legitime politische Vertretung der Palästinenser Beobachterstatus bei der UNO. Das Palästinensertuch – drapiert wie die Konturen Palästinas – gehörte ebenso wie das Holster auch später zu seinen Markenzeichen, ohne die er selten auftrat. Eine weitere bedeutende Rede hielt er am 13. Dezember 1988. Ein Novum war hier, dass die PLO die UN-Resolution anerkannte und Willen zum Kompromiss zeigte. Die gewaltsamen Aktionen der PLO wollte Arafat allerdings als legitimen Widerstand verstanden wissen. In dieser Rede wird auch jene Interpretation der Resolution 194 der UN-Vollversammlung bekräftigt, nach der diese das Rückkehrrecht der palästinensischen Flüchtlinge garantiere, womit er eine Doktrin festlegte, die auch heute noch, zumindest in offiziellen Verlautbarungen der PLO, Bestand hat. In der Rede gestand Arafat den Juden nicht explizit ein Recht auf nationale Selbstbestimmung zu und akzeptierte nicht ausdrücklich, dass Israel ein jüdischer Staat sein könnte. Als Konsequenz des israelischen Libanonfeldzugs gegen das Hauptquartier der PLO in Beirut im Juli/August 1982 musste Arafat nach Tunesien fliehen. Er verließ mit seinen Gefolgsleuten das von Israel besetzte Beirut und errichtete einen neuen PLO-Sitz im Exil in Tunis. Der Weg zur internationalen Anerkennung 1988 erkannte Arafat Israel indirekt an und erklärte 1989 die PLO-Charta von 1964, in der zur Zerstörung des Staates Israel aufgerufen wurde, für hinfällig. Im Jahre 1990 begrüßte Arafat den irakischen Einmarsch in Kuwait und solidarisierte sich mit Saddam Hussein. Die reichen arabischen Ölstaaten an der Seite des Kriegsgegners USA froren daraufhin ihre finanzielle Unterstützung der PLO ein. Eine weitere Folge war die Vertreibung der Palästinenser aus Kuwait 1991. Binnen weniger Tage mussten etwa 450.000 Palästinenser Kuwait verlassen. Dies und der Verlust wesentlicher Unterstützer in der arabischen Welt brachten Arafat 1993 dazu, im Namen der PLO Friedensverhandlungen mit Israel zu unternehmen, die zur gegenseitigen Anerkennung führten. Statt das Ende abzuwarten, sympathisierte Arafat 1991 noch während des laufenden Augustputsches gegen Michail Gorbatschow mit den Putschisten, womit er einen langjährigen Unterstützer verärgerte. Am 7. April 1992 überlebte Arafat einen Absturz einer Passagiermaschine der Air Bissau aufgrund eines Sandsturms in der libyschen Wüste. Arafat wurde in einem Krankenhaus in Misrata aufgrund eines Blutgerinnsels von dem Chirurgen Meftah Shwedy mehrmals am Gehirn operiert und am rechten Auge behandelt. Am 13. September 1993 kam es bei der Unterzeichnung der Prinzipienerklärung über die vorübergehende (palästinensische) Selbstverwaltung zwischen dem Staat Israel und der PLO in Washington zu einem historischen Handschlag zwischen Arafat und dem israelischen Ministerpräsidenten Jizhak Rabin. Friedensnobelpreisträger Rabin bezahlte später für dieses Entgegenkommen im Israelisch-Palästinensischen Konflikt durch einen Terroranschlag eines jüdischen Ultra-Nationalisten mit seinem Leben. Nach 27 Jahren Exil kehrte Arafat infolge des Autonomieabkommens am 1. Juli 1994 nach Palästina zurück und bildete in Gaza eine autonome Regierung, die Palästinensische Autonomiebehörde. 1993 wählte das TIME Magazin Die Friedensstifter (Nelson Mandela, Frederik Willem de Klerk, Jassir Arafat und Jitzchak Rabin) zu den Personen des Jahres. Im Dezember 1994 erhielt Arafat gemeinsam mit Shimon Peres und Jitzchak Rabin den Friedensnobelpreis. Während der Trauerwoche für Jitzchak Rabin nach dessen Ermordung im November 1995 besuchte Arafat Lea Rabin und ihre Familie in ihrer Wohnung in Tel Aviv, um seine Anteilnahme zum Ausdruck zu bringen. Es war das erste Mal, dass er israelischen Boden betrat. Aus Sicherheitsgründen hatte er nicht an den Beisetzungsfeierlichkeiten teilnehmen können. Er schilderte, wie sehr ihn der Mord bestürzt habe und wie verzweifelt er darüber sei, seinen Partner im Friedensprozess verloren zu haben. 1995 erhielt Arafat den Deutschen Medienpreis in Baden-Baden. 2000 verhandelte Arafat mit dem israelischen Ministerpräsidenten Ehud Barak und US-Präsident Clinton in Camp David über die Schaffung eines palästinensischen Staates. Die Verhandlungen scheiterten jedoch. Der abtretende Präsident Clinton und Barak, der kurz darauf in allgemeinen Wahlen von seinem politischen Gegner Ariel Scharon abgelöst wurde, gaben Arafat die alleinige Schuld am Scheitern dieser Verhandlungen. Arafat hingegen gab Barak und Clinton die Schuld am Scheitern. Zweite Intifada und politischer Niedergang Arafat wurde schon vor der Zweiten Intifada vorgeworfen, ein doppeltes Spiel zu treiben. Während er sich auf internationalem Parkett für Frieden und Diplomatie starkmachte, soll er vor seinen Anhängern in Gaza mit teilweise antisemitischen Reden Stimmung gegen Israel gemacht haben. Auch wurde ihm mehrfach vorgeworfen, sich aktiv am Waffenschmuggel für paramilitärische und terroristische Zwecke zu beteiligen (siehe Karine-A-Affäre) und die allein von ihm befehligten Sicherheitskräfte der Autonomiebehörde für Übergriffe auf Israel zur Verfügung zu stellen. Außerdem gab es Berichte britischer Medien wie der BBC, dass Terror-Organisationen wie die Fatah-nahen Al-Aqsa-Märtyrer-Brigaden über den Umweg der von Arafat regierten Autonomiebehörde indirekt von EU-Geldern finanziert würden. Schließlich duldete oder unterstützte er den erneuten Palästinenseraufstand, was ihn vor allem außenpolitisch isolierte. Als Reaktion auf die Zweite Intifada besetzte Israel weite Teile der autonomen Palästinensergebiete und betrieb dort eine Politik der gezielten Tötung von Protagonisten radikaler Palästinenserorganisationen wie Fatah, Hamas oder Islamischer Dschihad, die für Selbstmordattentate verantwortlich gemacht wurden. Die israelische Regierung machte auch Arafat selbst für diese gewaltsamen Übergriffe verantwortlich. Ab 2001 wurde der in Ramallah lebende Arafat von Israel mehrfach unter Hausarrest gestellt. Seine Hubschrauber wurden im Dezember 2001 zerstört, sodass er nicht mehr zwischen Gaza und Ramallah reisen konnte. Im Jahr 2002 zerstörte die israelische Armee einen Großteil von Arafats Hauptquartier, der Muqāta'a. Am 11. September 2003 fasste die israelische Regierung den Beschluss, Arafat auszuweisen. Mit einem Hubschrauber sollte er ins Exil nach Nordafrika gebracht werden. Nach dem Ausweisungsbeschluss gingen zehntausende Palästinenser protestierend auf die Straße. Arafat appellierte an die Bevölkerung, Widerstand gegen den Beschluss zu leisten. Er wolle „lieber sterben, als sich zu ergeben“. Am 14. September 2003 stellte der stellvertretende israelische Ministerpräsident Ehud Olmert auch ein Attentat auf Arafat als eine „legitime Möglichkeit“ seiner Entfernung dar. Am 16. September 2003 ließen die USA eine Resolution des Weltsicherheitsrates gegen die Ausweisung Arafats an ihrem Veto scheitern. Deutschland enthielt sich der Stimme. Korruption Im Mai 2002 stellte der BND fest, dass die Verwendung von EU-Geldern für den Terrorismus „nicht auszuschließen“ sei, da Arafat offensichtlich nicht zwischen der Struktur des Autonomie-Regimes und seiner Fatah-Bewegung trenne. Das Gutachten spricht weiterhin von „bekanntem Missmanagement“ und „weit verbreiteter Korruption“ (Aktenzeichen 39C-04/2/02). Die USA und Israel hatten die Europäische Union in Brüssel zu dem Zeitpunkt bereits mehrfach aufgefordert, die Verwendung der Subventionen für die Palästinensische Autonomiebehörde genauer zu überprüfen. Brüssel erklärte, für Transparenz und Kontrolle der Fördermittel sorge der Internationale Währungsfonds. Der IWF legte im Jahr 2003 jedoch einen verheerenden Bericht zu „Ökonomischen Leistungen und Reformen unter Konfliktbedingungen“ vor, aus dem hervorging, dass zwischen 1995 und 2000 über 900 Millionen Dollar an Fördergeldern für die Palästinensische Autonomiebehörde „verschwanden“. Weisungsbefugt für die Verwendung des Geldes seien allein Arafat und „enge Vertraute“ gewesen. Arafat kontrollierte dem Bericht zufolge bis zu seinem Tod allein 8 % des palästinensischen Gesamtbudgets. Familie Arafat war seit dem 17. Juli 1990 mit Suha at-Tawil, mit der er eine Tochter Zahwa (* 24. Juli 1995 in Neuilly-sur-Seine) hat, verheiratet. Ab dem Beginn der zweiten Intifada, also ab 2001, lebten Frau und Tochter in Paris und Tunis. 2007 zog Suha nach Malta. Sein Neffe Musa Arafat war Leiter des palästinensischen Militärgeheimdienstes, sein Bruder Fathi Arafat Mediziner. |

Danach meldete er sich freiwillig zur ägyptischen Armee und kämpfte im Sueskrieg 1956 gegen Frankreich, Großbritannien und Israel. Er galt als Sprengstoffexperte und war Leutnant in der ägyptischen Armee. Danach ging er im selben Jahr nach Kuwait, wo er als Ingenieur arbeitete und ein erfolgreicher Bauunternehmer wurde. Gründung der Fatah 1957 gründete er in Kuwait zusammen mit Chalil al-Wazir (Abu Dschihad) die erste Zelle der Bewegung zur Befreiung Palästinas (al-Fatah), aus der 1959 die gleichnamige politische Partei hervorging. Ab 1958 war Arafat Vorstandsmitglied und ab 1968 Vorsitzender der Fatah. Durch seine aktive Teilnahme an der Schlacht von Karame 1968 begründete er seinen Heldenmythos und war ab 1969 Vorsitzender der PLO, die 1964 durch die Arabische Liga ins Leben gerufen worden war. Ende der 1960er Jahre wuchsen die Spannungen zwischen der PLO und der jordanischen Regierung; palästinensische Milizen (Fedayin) hatten faktisch einen Staat im Staate Jordanien etabliert und kontrollierten strategische Positionen wie die Öl-Raffinerien bei Zarqa. Jordanien betrachtete diese Umstände als eine wachsende Bedrohung seiner Souveränität und seiner Sicherheit und versuchte, die palästinensischen Milizen zu entwaffnen. Im Juni 1970 brachen nach einem fehlgeschlagenen palästinensischen Attentat auf den jordanischen König offene Kämpfe aus, die mit der Flucht der PLO aus Jordanien in den Libanon endeten. Wurde die Schlacht von Karame als erster historischer Sieg der PLO angesehen, so erlitt sie unter Arafats Führung 1970 mit dem Schwarzen September eine schwere Niederlage. Dieser musste zunächst nach Kairo, dann in den Libanon fliehen. Aufsehen erregte der historische Auftritt Arafats vor der UN-Vollversammlung am 13. November 1974, bei dem er in Uniform, mit der Kufiya und umgeschnalltem Pistolenholster eine Rede hielt, die von arabischen und kommunistischen Staaten mit Begeisterung aufgenommen wurde. In der Rede reklamierte Arafat den alleinigen Machtanspruch über Palästina für die PLO. Er sprach davon, eine Welt ohne Kolonialismus, Imperialismus, Neokolonialismus und ohne „Rassismus in all seinen Ausformungen, einschließlich des Zionismus“ schaffen zu wollen. Arafat vermied es, von Israel zu sprechen, um dem Staat jegliche Legitimität abzusprechen, und verwendete stattdessen den Begriff zionistische Entität. Den Zionismus stellte er in dieser Rede als eine imperialistische, kolonialistische und rassistische Ideologie dar, die – dezidiert reaktionär und diskriminierend – mit dem Antisemitismus gleichzusetzen sei. Ferner wiederholte er ein altes antisemitisches Stereotyp, indem er behauptete, der Zionismus wolle, dass die Juden ihren Heimatländern keine Treue entgegenbrächten und auf einer anderen (höheren) Ebene als ihre Mitbürger leben sollten. Er sprach der UNO das Recht ab, das unteilbare Heimatland der Palästinenser zu teilen, und wies damit den Teilungsbeschluss von 1947 zurück. Auch behauptete er, der Palästinakrieg von 1948 sei von Israel und nicht von den arabischen Staaten begonnen worden. Die PLO erhielt als legitime politische Vertretung der Palästinenser Beobachterstatus bei der UNO. Das Palästinensertuch – drapiert wie die Konturen Palästinas – gehörte ebenso wie das Holster auch später zu seinen Markenzeichen, ohne die er selten auftrat. Eine weitere bedeutende Rede hielt er am 13. Dezember 1988. Ein Novum war hier, dass die PLO die UN-Resolution anerkannte und Willen zum Kompromiss zeigte. Die gewaltsamen Aktionen der PLO wollte Arafat allerdings als legitimen Widerstand verstanden wissen. In dieser Rede wird auch jene Interpretation der Resolution 194 der UN-Vollversammlung bekräftigt, nach der diese das Rückkehrrecht der palästinensischen Flüchtlinge garantiere, womit er eine Doktrin festlegte, die auch heute noch, zumindest in offiziellen Verlautbarungen der PLO, Bestand hat. In der Rede gestand Arafat den Juden nicht explizit ein Recht auf nationale Selbstbestimmung zu und akzeptierte nicht ausdrücklich, dass Israel ein jüdischer Staat sein könnte. Als Konsequenz des israelischen Libanonfeldzugs gegen das Hauptquartier der PLO in Beirut im Juli/August 1982 musste Arafat nach Tunesien fliehen. Er verließ mit seinen Gefolgsleuten das von Israel besetzte Beirut und errichtete einen neuen PLO-Sitz im Exil in Tunis. Der Weg zur internationalen Anerkennung 1988 erkannte Arafat Israel indirekt an und erklärte 1989 die PLO-Charta von 1964, in der zur Zerstörung des Staates Israel aufgerufen wurde, für hinfällig. Im Jahre 1990 begrüßte Arafat den irakischen Einmarsch in Kuwait und solidarisierte sich mit Saddam Hussein. Die reichen arabischen Ölstaaten an der Seite des Kriegsgegners USA froren daraufhin ihre finanzielle Unterstützung der PLO ein. Eine weitere Folge war die Vertreibung der Palästinenser aus Kuwait 1991. Binnen weniger Tage mussten etwa 450.000 Palästinenser Kuwait verlassen. Dies und der Verlust wesentlicher Unterstützer in der arabischen Welt brachten Arafat 1993 dazu, im Namen der PLO Friedensverhandlungen mit Israel zu unternehmen, die zur gegenseitigen Anerkennung führten. Statt das Ende abzuwarten, sympathisierte Arafat 1991 noch während des laufenden Augustputsches gegen Michail Gorbatschow mit den Putschisten, womit er einen langjährigen Unterstützer verärgerte. Am 7. April 1992 überlebte Arafat einen Absturz einer Passagiermaschine der Air Bissau aufgrund eines Sandsturms in der libyschen Wüste. Arafat wurde in einem Krankenhaus in Misrata aufgrund eines Blutgerinnsels von dem Chirurgen Meftah Shwedy mehrmals am Gehirn operiert und am rechten Auge behandelt. Am 13. September 1993 kam es bei der Unterzeichnung der Prinzipienerklärung über die vorübergehende (palästinensische) Selbstverwaltung zwischen dem Staat Israel und der PLO in Washington zu einem historischen Handschlag zwischen Arafat und dem israelischen Ministerpräsidenten Jizhak Rabin. Friedensnobelpreisträger Rabin bezahlte später für dieses Entgegenkommen im Israelisch-Palästinensischen Konflikt durch einen Terroranschlag eines jüdischen Ultra-Nationalisten mit seinem Leben. Nach 27 Jahren Exil kehrte Arafat infolge des Autonomieabkommens am 1. Juli 1994 nach Palästina zurück und bildete in Gaza eine autonome Regierung, die Palästinensische Autonomiebehörde. 1993 wählte das TIME Magazin Die Friedensstifter (Nelson Mandela, Frederik Willem de Klerk, Jassir Arafat und Jitzchak Rabin) zu den Personen des Jahres. Im Dezember 1994 erhielt Arafat gemeinsam mit Shimon Peres und Jitzchak Rabin den Friedensnobelpreis. Während der Trauerwoche für Jitzchak Rabin nach dessen Ermordung im November 1995 besuchte Arafat Lea Rabin und ihre Familie in ihrer Wohnung in Tel Aviv, um seine Anteilnahme zum Ausdruck zu bringen. Es war das erste Mal, dass er israelischen Boden betrat. Aus Sicherheitsgründen hatte er nicht an den Beisetzungsfeierlichkeiten teilnehmen können. Er schilderte, wie sehr ihn der Mord bestürzt habe und wie verzweifelt er darüber sei, seinen Partner im Friedensprozess verloren zu haben. 1995 erhielt Arafat den Deutschen Medienpreis in Baden-Baden. 2000 verhandelte Arafat mit dem israelischen Ministerpräsidenten Ehud Barak und US-Präsident Clinton in Camp David über die Schaffung eines palästinensischen Staates. Die Verhandlungen scheiterten jedoch. Der abtretende Präsident Clinton und Barak, der kurz darauf in allgemeinen Wahlen von seinem politischen Gegner Ariel Scharon abgelöst wurde, gaben Arafat die alleinige Schuld am Scheitern dieser Verhandlungen. Arafat hingegen gab Barak und Clinton die Schuld am Scheitern. Zweite Intifada und politischer Niedergang Arafat wurde schon vor der Zweiten Intifada vorgeworfen, ein doppeltes Spiel zu treiben. Während er sich auf internationalem Parkett für Frieden und Diplomatie starkmachte, soll er vor seinen Anhängern in Gaza mit teilweise antisemitischen Reden Stimmung gegen Israel gemacht haben. Auch wurde ihm mehrfach vorgeworfen, sich aktiv am Waffenschmuggel für paramilitärische und terroristische Zwecke zu beteiligen (siehe Karine-A-Affäre) und die allein von ihm befehligten Sicherheitskräfte der Autonomiebehörde für Übergriffe auf Israel zur Verfügung zu stellen. Außerdem gab es Berichte britischer Medien wie der BBC, dass Terror-Organisationen wie die Fatah-nahen Al-Aqsa-Märtyrer-Brigaden über den Umweg der von Arafat regierten Autonomiebehörde indirekt von EU-Geldern finanziert würden. Schließlich duldete oder unterstützte er den erneuten Palästinenseraufstand, was ihn vor allem außenpolitisch isolierte. Als Reaktion auf die Zweite Intifada besetzte Israel weite Teile der autonomen Palästinensergebiete und betrieb dort eine Politik der gezielten Tötung von Protagonisten radikaler Palästinenserorganisationen wie Fatah, Hamas oder Islamischer Dschihad, die für Selbstmordattentate verantwortlich gemacht wurden. Die israelische Regierung machte auch Arafat selbst für diese gewaltsamen Übergriffe verantwortlich. Ab 2001 wurde der in Ramallah lebende Arafat von Israel mehrfach unter Hausarrest gestellt. Seine Hubschrauber wurden im Dezember 2001 zerstört, sodass er nicht mehr zwischen Gaza und Ramallah reisen konnte. Im Jahr 2002 zerstörte die israelische Armee einen Großteil von Arafats Hauptquartier, der Muqāta'a. Am 11. September 2003 fasste die israelische Regierung den Beschluss, Arafat auszuweisen. Mit einem Hubschrauber sollte er ins Exil nach Nordafrika gebracht werden. Nach dem Ausweisungsbeschluss gingen zehntausende Palästinenser protestierend auf die Straße. Arafat appellierte an die Bevölkerung, Widerstand gegen den Beschluss zu leisten. Er wolle „lieber sterben, als sich zu ergeben“. Am 14. September 2003 stellte der stellvertretende israelische Ministerpräsident Ehud Olmert auch ein Attentat auf Arafat als eine „legitime Möglichkeit“ seiner Entfernung dar. Am 16. September 2003 ließen die USA eine Resolution des Weltsicherheitsrates gegen die Ausweisung Arafats an ihrem Veto scheitern. Deutschland enthielt sich der Stimme. Korruption Im Mai 2002 stellte der BND fest, dass die Verwendung von EU-Geldern für den Terrorismus „nicht auszuschließen“ sei, da Arafat offensichtlich nicht zwischen der Struktur des Autonomie-Regimes und seiner Fatah-Bewegung trenne. Das Gutachten spricht weiterhin von „bekanntem Missmanagement“ und „weit verbreiteter Korruption“ (Aktenzeichen 39C-04/2/02). Die USA und Israel hatten die Europäische Union in Brüssel zu dem Zeitpunkt bereits mehrfach aufgefordert, die Verwendung der Subventionen für die Palästinensische Autonomiebehörde genauer zu überprüfen. Brüssel erklärte, für Transparenz und Kontrolle der Fördermittel sorge der Internationale Währungsfonds. Der IWF legte im Jahr 2003 jedoch einen verheerenden Bericht zu „Ökonomischen Leistungen und Reformen unter Konfliktbedingungen“ vor, aus dem hervorging, dass zwischen 1995 und 2000 über 900 Millionen Dollar an Fördergeldern für die Palästinensische Autonomiebehörde „verschwanden“. Weisungsbefugt für die Verwendung des Geldes seien allein Arafat und „enge Vertraute“ gewesen. Arafat kontrollierte dem Bericht zufolge bis zu seinem Tod allein 8 % des palästinensischen Gesamtbudgets. Familie Arafat war seit dem 17. Juli 1990 mit Suha at-Tawil, mit der er eine Tochter Zahwa (* 24. Juli 1995 in Neuilly-sur-Seine) hat, verheiratet. Ab dem Beginn der zweiten Intifada, also ab 2001, lebten Frau und Tochter in Paris und Tunis. 2007 zog Suha nach Malta. Sein Neffe Musa Arafat war Leiter des palästinensischen Militärgeheimdienstes, sein Bruder Fathi Arafat Mediziner. |
G;|Wilhelm Frick (* 12. März 1877 in Alsenz; † 16. Oktober 1946 in Nürnberg) war ein deutscher nationalsozialistischer Politiker und unter anderem von 1933 bis 1943 Reichsminister des Innern. Er war an Aufbau und Etablierung des NS-Staates maßgeblich beteiligt. Frick war einer der 24 im Nürnberger Prozess gegen die Hauptkriegsverbrecher vor dem Internationalen Militärgerichtshof angeklagten Personen. Er wurde am 1. Oktober 1946 in drei von vier Anklagepunkten schuldig gesprochen, zum Tod durch den Strang verurteilt und am 16. Oktober 1946 hingerichtet.  Familie Frick war das jüngste der vier Kinder des evangelischen Bezirksoberlehrers Wilhelm Frick († 1918) und dessen Frau Henriette († 1893). Am 25. April 1910 heiratete er in Pirmasens Elisabetha Emilie Nagel (27. April 1890–25. Oktober 1978), von der er am 1. Februar 1934 geschieden wurde. Aus der ersten Ehe entstammten zwei Söhne und eine Tochter. Am 12. März 1934 ehelichte er in Münchberg Margarete Schultze-Naumburg, geborene Margarete Karolina Berta Dörr (1. Februar 1896–13. Mai 1960), die bis zum 7. Februar 1934 mit dem Architekten und Reichstagsabgeordneten Paul Schultze-Naumburg verheiratet gewesen war. Aus dieser Ehe gingen die Tochter Renate Günthert (1935–2011) und Sohn Dieter Frick (1937–2007) hervor. Schule und Studium Frick besuchte die Volksschule und das Gymnasium in Kaiserslautern. Er belegte zuerst ab 1896 ein Semester Philologie an der Universität München, ehe er von 1897 bis 1900 Rechtswissenschaft an den Universitäten in Göttingen und Berlin studierte. Während seines Studiums wurde er Mitglied des Akademischen Gesangvereins München. Die juristischen Prüfungen legte er im Jahr 1900 in München ab. Seine Promotion zum Dr. iur. folgte 1901 an der Universität Heidelberg. Bayerischer Staatsdienst Ab Mitte 1900 war Frick in Kaiserslautern als Rechtspraktikant (Referendar) tätig und wurde 1903 nach erfolgreichem Bestehen der Staatsprüfung für den höheren Justiz- und Verwaltungsdienst als Verwaltungsbeamter in den bayerischen Staatsdienst übernommen. Von 1904 an arbeitete er für die Kreisregierung Oberbayerns als Regierungsakzessist und als Amtsanwalt bei der Polizeidirektion in München. 1907 erfolgte seine Ernennung zum Bezirksamtsassessor und Versetzung zum Bezirksamt Pirmasens, welches er ab 1914 als Amtsverweser leitete. Als untauglich ausgemustert, musste er nicht am Ersten Weltkrieg teilnehmen. Die Beförderung zum Regierungsassessor und die Versetzung auf eigenen Wunsch zur Polizeidirektion München erfolgte 1917. Anfangs leitete Frick dort die Kriegswucher-Abteilung, was seine antisemitische Einstellung mit beeinflusst haben soll, wie ein Brief an seine Schwester zeigt. 1919 wurde ihm als Bezirksamtmann die Leitung der politischen Polizei übertragen. In dieser Funktion sympathisierte er mit dem Rechtsextremismus. Er verhalf einem Freikorpsmitglied, das Morde begangen hatte, durch die Ausstellung falscher Pässe zur Flucht. 1919 lernte er über den Polizeipräsidenten Ernst Pöhner Adolf Hitler kennen und unterstützte Hitler sowie die NSDAP durch die großzügige Genehmigung von Versammlungen und Hetzplakaten. 1923 erfolgte seine Beförderung zum Oberamtmann und Leiter des Sicherheitsdienstes der Kriminalpolizei München. Im November 1923 war er zusammen mit Pöhner, bis 1921 Münchener Polizeipräsident, am Hitlerputsch beteiligt. Frick sollte neuer Polizeipräsident werden. Während des Putschversuches blieb er in der Polizeidirektion und sorgte unter anderem dafür, dass die Landespolizei und der Vertreter des Polizeipräsidenten nicht sofort alarmiert wurden. Wegen „der Beihilfe zum Verbrechen des Hochverrats“ wurde er 1924 zu einer Strafe von 15 Monaten Festungshaft verurteilt, die aber nach ungefähr fünf Monaten Untersuchungshaft zur Bewährung ausgesetzt wurde. Für seine Teilnahme am Putsch wurde ihm 1935 von Hitler das Ehrenzeichen der Bewegung verliehen. Seine Entlassung aus dem Staatsdienst wurde durch den Bayerischen Disziplinarhof mit der Begründung aufgehoben, er habe nicht in hochverräterischer Absicht gehandelt. Frick war anschließend von 1926 bis 1930 sowie von 1932 bis 1933 als Beamter im Oberversicherungsamt Münchens – zum Schluss als Regierungsrat I. Klasse – tätig. Mitglied des Reichstags Nach der Reichstagswahl am 4. Mai 1924 zog Wilhelm Frick als Abgeordneter der Nationalsozialistischen Freiheitspartei – das war eine Listenverbindung der Deutschvölkischen Freiheitspartei und der verbotenen NSDAP – für den Wahlkreis 24 (Oberbayern-Schwaben) in den Reichstag ein, dem er bis 1945 angehörte. Am 1. September 1925 wurde Frick Mitglied der NSDAP (Mitgliedsnr. 10). Den Vorsitz der Reichstagsfraktion mit damals zwölf Abgeordneten übernahm er 1928. In dieser Funktion wurde er 1933 von Hitler zum Reichsleiter berufen. Seine Reichstagsreden waren geprägt von einem radikalen Antisemitismus und Rassismus sowie massiven Beschimpfungen und Beleidigungen der politischen Gegner. Durch seine destruktive Arbeit im Reichstag wirkte er maßgeblich am Untergang des Parlamentarismus der Weimarer Republik mit. Thüringischer Staatsminister Am 23. Januar 1930 wurde Wilhelm Frick im Land Thüringen Staatsminister für Inneres und Volksbildung in einer Koalitionsregierung und somit der erste Minister der NSDAP zu Zeiten der Weimarer Republik. Frick war zugleich Stellvertreter des Vorsitzenden der Landesregierung Erwin Baum. Unter dem Namen Baum-Frick-Regierung wurde diese thüringische Landesregierung bekannt, eine Koalition aus Thüringer Landbund, NSDAP, Wirtschaftspartei, Deutschnationaler Volkspartei und Deutsche Volkspartei. Frick betrieb mit Verordnungen die Entlassung von kommunistischen Lehrern und Bürgermeistern, den Personalabbau insbesondere bei den sozialdemokratischen Beamten sowie die bevorzugte Einstellung von Nationalsozialisten in die neugeschaffene Landespolizei. Am 19. März 1930 sperrte deshalb Reichsinnenminister Carl Severing (SPD) die Reichszuschüsse für die thüringische Landespolizei, was am 16. April wieder aufgehoben wurde, nachdem die Landesregierung erklärt hatte, künftig keine Nationalsozialisten in die Polizei aufzunehmen. Auch die ausländische Presse nahm diese Vorgänge wahr. Die Londoner Times beschrieb Frick anlässlich der Machtergreifung Hitlers als „wohlbekannten Innenminister in Thüringen, der sich vieler administrativer Exzentrizitäten schuldig und die Polizei zu einem Instrument der Partei gemacht hatte.“ Frick setzte gegen den Willen der Universität Jena die Berufung des Rasseforschers Hans F. K. Günther für den neugeschaffenen Lehrstuhl Sozialanthropologie durch. Sein Ziel war die Förderung der nationalsozialistischen Bewegung und Weltanschauung. Er sorgte für zeitlich begrenzte Erscheinungsverbote von kritischen Zeitungen sowie für Aufführungsverbote von Theaterstücken und Filmen mit pazifistischen Inhalten. Am 8. Februar 1930 verfügte er, dass Erich Maria Remarques Roman Im Westen nichts Neues in keiner Schule des Landes mehr gelesen werden durfte. Den im Dezember desselben Jahres erschienenen gleichnamigen Film ließ er in Thüringen noch vor dem allgemeinen Aufführungsverbot durch die Filmoberprüfstelle am 11. Dezember verbieten. Seine nationalsozialistische Art des Schulgebetes („Schenk uns des Heilandes heldischen Mut … Deutschland erwache! Herr mach uns frei!“) musste er aufgrund verfassungswidrigen Inhaltes wieder zurückziehen. Nach dem erfolgreichen Misstrauensantrag der SPD vom 1. April 1931 gegen ihn und den nationalsozialistischen Staatsrat Willy Marschler folgte sein Sturz und das Ausscheiden aus der Regierung. Reichsminister Am 30. Januar 1933 ernannte Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg Adolf Hitler zum Reichskanzler. Dieser holte Frick und Hermann Göring als einzige nationalsozialistische Minister in sein Kabinett. Frick bekam als Reichsminister des Innern eine Schlüsselposition und war zu diesem Zeitpunkt einer der einflussreichsten NS-Politiker. Er übernahm unter anderem die Funktion des Reichswahlleiters, der für die Durchführung der plebiszitären Reichstagswahlen zuständig war und die Vergabe der Reichstagsmandate mit beeinflusste. Seine Macht und sein Einfluss begannen zu schwinden. Schon im März 1933 musste er erste Sachgebiete seines Ministeriums an das für Joseph Goebbels neu eingerichtete Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda abtreten. Ein Jahr später verlor er Zuständigkeiten an das neue Reichsministerium für Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung. Allerdings wurde er zur selben Zeit zusätzlich Innenminister Preußens. So war er seit Mai 1934 in der Situation, dass er als Reichsinnenminister Vorgesetzter, als preußischer Innenminister Untergebener des kommissarischen preußischen Ministerpräsidenten Hermann Göring war. Eine Beteiligung Fricks am Röhmputsch 1934 ist nicht dokumentiert. Er versuchte jedoch, nachträglich die Morde durch das Gesetz über Maßnahmen der Staatsnotwehr zu legalisieren, welches er zusammen mit Hitler und dem Reichsminister der Justiz Franz Gürtner am 3. Juli 1934 unterzeichnete. Auf der anderen Seite ist etwa bekannt, dass Frick sich für die festgesetzten Anwälte des im sogenannten Röhmputsch umgebrachten katholischen Politikers Erich Klausener einsetzte. 1935 wurde das Reichsministerium für die Kirchlichen Angelegenheiten gegründet, womit wiederum Fachressorts wegfielen. Durch die Ernennung Heinrich Himmlers im Jahr 1936 zum Chef der Deutschen Polizei verlor Frick entscheidend an Macht. Am 9. September 1939 wurde die Zivilverwaltung auf Kriegsbedingungen umgestellt. Frick wurde Generalbevollmächtigter für die Reichsverwaltung, dadurch war er auch Mitglied im Reichsverteidigungsrat. 1942 erhielt er von Hitler anlässlich seines 65. Geburtstags eine Dotation in Höhe von 250.000 Reichsmark. Mitwirkung bei der Gleichschaltung Durch eine Vielzahl von Verordnungen und Gesetzen wirkte er als Reichsinnenminister maßgebend mit, eine Scheinlegalität aufzubauen, die Weimarer Verfassung zu untergraben sowie die Machtübernahme der NSDAP endgültig abzusichern. Schon am 4. Februar 1933 wurde durch die Regierung eine von Frick vorgelegte Verordnung des Reichspräsidenten zum Schutze des Deutschen Volkes erlassen, die die Versammlungs- und Pressefreiheit massiv einschränkte und den Reichsminister des Innern als Entscheidungsinstanz festlegte. Mit der nach dem Reichstagsbrand am 28. Februar verabschiedeten Verordnung des Reichspräsidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat ließ er die Grundrechte der Weimarer Verfassung außer Kraft setzen und entmachtete ohne Rechtsgrundlage die nicht-nationalsozialistischen Landesregierungen durch ihm unterstellte Reichskommissare. Für die Verabschiedung des Ermächtigungsgesetzes am 23. März durch eine Mindestanzahl von 2/3 der Reichstagsmitglieder gab Frick die Anregung zu einer Änderung der Geschäftsordnung, nach der „als anwesend auch die unentschuldigt fehlenden Abgeordneten“ gelten sollten. Am 31. März sorgte er mit dem vorläufigen Gesetz zur Gleichschaltung der Länder mit dem Reich dafür, dass die Reichstagswahlergebnisse vom 5. März 1933 – ohne die Stimmen für die KPD – auf die Länderparlamente übertragen wurden. Am 7. April wurde ein Gesetz (Zweites Gesetz zur Gleichschaltung der Länder mit dem Reich) verabschiedet, auf dessen Basis die Länder – durch das Einsetzen von Reichsstatthaltern – endgültig entmachtet wurden. Als Innenminister war er auch für die Spitzensportförderung zuständig. Er sah die Chance hier die Gleichschaltung modellhaft in einer Weise vorzuführen, dass auch der unpolitische Teil der Bevölkerung schnell den Vorteil der Vereinheitlichung (bei Ausschluss von Juden und Kommunisten) sehen konnte. Die erfolgreiche Vorbereitung der Athleten auf die Olympischen Spiele 1936 erfolgte unter seiner Verantwortung, da er den Reichssportführer als Staatssekretär in seinem Ministerium führte und besoldete. Mitwirkung bei der Rassenpolitik Mit großem Engagement sorgte Frick für die Gesetze zur Umsetzung der nationalsozialistischen Rassenideologie, die er immer wieder in seinen Reichstagreden propagiert hatte. Schon am 7. April 1933 trat unter seiner Federführung das Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums in Kraft, was insbesondere ein Berufsverbot für jüdische, aber auch kommunistische Beamte beinhaltete. Die meisten Darstellungen folgen den Aussagen Bernhard Löseners und gehen davon aus, dass Frick an den Nürnberger Rassegesetzen von 1935 nur marginal beteiligt war. Laut einer 1992 erschienen Untersuchung von Neliba soll Frick am Entwurf der Gesetze stärker beteiligt gewesen sein als bis dahin angenommen. Zum 1. Januar 1934 trat das Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses, welches „zum Nutzen der Volksgesundheit“ die Zwangssterilisation beinhaltete, in Kraft. Eine Vielzahl ähnlicher Gesetze sollte noch folgen. Auch wenn 1940 das sogenannte Euthanasiegesetz nicht in Kraft trat, so wurde doch ohne gesetzliche Grundlage das Vernichtungsprogramm mit der Kenntnis Fricks als Aktion T4 durchgeführt. Die Abteilung IV Volksgesundheit des Reichsministeriums des Innern hatte Weisungsbefugnis über die Psychiatrischen Anstalten und unterstützte die Anstaltstötungen organisatorisch. Differenzen mit Hitler und Entmachtung Hitler löste Frick am 20. August 1943 als Reichsinnenminister durch Himmler ab. Ein konkreter Anlass dazu ist nicht überliefert. Frick behauptete als Angeklagter im Nürnberger Prozess gegen die Hauptkriegsverbrecher, er habe bereits ab 1937 keinen direkten Zugang mehr zu Hitler gehabt. Dies stimmt nachweislich nicht mit den Tatsachen überein, könnte aber, über eine bloße Schutzbehauptung hinaus, Fricks Eindruck entsprochen haben. Tatsächlich hat Hitler ab 1940 wichtige Sachfragen mit Frick nicht mehr besprochen und war wiederholt auf dessen Vortragswünsche nicht eingegangen. Hitler soll 1942 angemerkt haben, Frick sei nicht konsequent genug nationalsozialistisch und könne mit der Entwicklung nicht Schritt halten. Diese und weitere negative Äußerungen Hitlers über Frick sind unter anderem mehrfach in Joseph Goebbels’ Tagebüchern dokumentiert. Dass Hitler von Frick Abstand nahm, wird insbesondere auf eine von Frick angestrebte Reichsreform zurückgeführt, die klarere Strukturen innerhalb sowie zwischen den Ministerien und Behörden vorsah, was auch die Auflösung diverser von Frick als überflüssig erachteter Behörden und Funktionärspositionen miteingeschlossen hätte. Dies rief naturgemäß Misstrauen und Widerstand im erweiterten Führungskreis des Regimes hervor, lief aber vor allem auch Hitlers Führungsstil entgegen, der das amorphe Gebilde des Regimes mit untereinander konkurrierenden Behörden und teilweise unklaren Zuständigkeiten konservieren wollte. Frick behielt zwar weiterhin den Rang eines Reichsministers, wurde aber als Reichsprotektor von Böhmen und Mähren 1943 nach Prag abgeschoben. Als Reichsprotektor hatte Frick eine repräsentative Funktion; die eigentliche Macht hatte der „Deutsche Staatsminister für das Protektorat“, der Leiter der Verwaltung Karl Hermann Frank, inne. Da sich Frick der Bedeutungslosigkeit seiner neuen Funktion voll bewusst war, lehnte er sie zunächst ab, beugte sich jedoch schließlich Hitlers Diktat. Oft hielt er sich in dieser Zeit an seinem privaten Wohnsitz in Kempfenhausen am Starnberger See auf. Nürnberger Prozess Nach seiner Verhaftung im Jahre 1945 wurde Frick zusammen mit anderen NSDAP-Größen und hochrangigen Angehörigen der Wehrmacht im Camp Ashcan im luxemburgischen Bad Mondorf interniert und verhört. Im August 1945 folgte die Überstellung nach Nürnberg, wo er im Nürnberger Prozess gegen die Hauptkriegsverbrecher angeklagt war. Ihm wurde gemeinsamer Plan oder Verschwörung (1), Verbrechen gegen den Frieden (2), Kriegsverbrechen (3) und Verbrechen gegen die Menschlichkeit (4) vorgeworfen. Als einziger der Angeklagten ließ er sich nicht mündlich unter Eid vernehmen und somit keinem Kreuzverhör unterziehen. Am 1. Oktober 1946 wurde er vom Internationalen Militärgerichtshof in den Anklagepunkten 2, 3 und 4 für schuldig befunden und zum Tode durch den Strang verurteilt. In seinem Schlusswort zeigte Frick keine Einsicht und sagte: „Der Anklage gegenüber habe ich ein reines Gewissen. Mein ganzes Leben war Dienst an Volk und Vaterland. Ihnen habe ich meine beste Kraft in treuester Pflichterfüllung gewidmet. Ich bin überzeugt, dass kein patriotischer Amerikaner oder Angehöriger eines anderen Landes in gleicher Lage seines Landes an meiner Stelle anders gehandelt hätte. Denn jede andere Handlungsweise wäre Bruch meines Treueides, Hoch- und Landesverrat gewesen“. Am 16. Oktober 1946 wurde Frick hingerichtet, ebenso neun andere Verurteilte des Nürnberger Prozesses gegen die Hauptkriegsverbrecher. Der Leichnam wurde einen Tag später im Krematorium des Münchener Ostfriedhofs eingeäschert und die Asche in einen Seitenarm der Isar gestreut. In der Sowjetischen Besatzungszone wurden Fricks sämtliche Schriften auf die Liste der auszusondernden Literatur gesetzt. |
G;|Margarita Wassiljewna Woloschin-Sabaschnikow (russisch Маргарита Васильевна Сабашникова/Margarita Wassiljewna Sabaschnikowa; * 31. Januar 1882 in Moskau; † 2. November 1973 in Stuttgart) war eine russische Malerin und Schriftstellerin. Sie machte sich in frühen Jahren hauptsächlich als Porträt-Malerin russischer Geistesgrößen einen Namen, während in der zweiten Lebenshälfte vor allem religiöse Motive entstanden. Als Schriftstellerin wurde sie mit ihrer Autobiographie Die grüne Schlange bekannt.  Kindheit und Jugend Margarita Woloschin-Sabaschnikow wurde am 31. Januar 1882 als Tochter der Moskauer Kaufmannsfamilie Sabaschnikow geboren, die dem gebildeten fortschrittlichen Bürgertum angehörte. Ihre Kindheit verbrachte sie zum Teil im Elternhaus ihrer Familie, zum Teil bei ihrer Großmutter und teils auf einem elterlichen Gut. Ihr Vater war allerdings als Kaufmann nicht sehr erfolgreich, weshalb das Haus der Familie verkauft werden musste. Daraufhin ging sie im Alter von zehn Jahren mit ihrer Mutter, ihren Geschwistern und mit zwei Hauslehrerinnen ins Ausland, wo sie durch ihre verschiedenen Aufenthalte in Paris, Lausanne, Belgien, Italien eine umfassende Bildung erfuhr. Ihr Interesse für Kunst und Kultur wurde frühzeitig geweckt. Nach drei Jahren zurück in Russland, erhielt sie Unterricht in Musik und Literatur und bald darauf ihren ersten professionellen Unterricht bei dem Maler Abram Archipow. Nach dem Abitur ging Margarita Sabaschnikow nach St. Petersburg, um im Atelier des Malers Ilja Repin zu arbeiten. Seine naturalistische Malerei hinterfragte sie: „Hat es denn einen Sinn zu wiederholen, was schon da ist? Es muss eine ganz andere Kunst entstehen, die eine nie dagewesene Welt offenbart.“ Mit ihren Fragen wandte sie sich an den damals schon alten Lew Tolstoi (seine Frau und ihre Mutter waren befreundet), von dem sie sich Rat erhoffte. Er empfahl ihr, die Kunst als Freizeitgestaltung zu betreiben und ansonsten das Leben einer Bäuerin zu führen. Trotz dieser für sie erschütternden Äußerung ließ sich Sabaschnikow von ihrem eingeschlagenen Weg nicht abbringen. Die einmal aufgeworfenen Fragen der Probleme der Kunst, der sozialen Ordnung und der Stellung der Malerei beschäftigten sie weiter und führten sie letztlich zu tiefen Fragen über den Sinn des Lebens überhaupt. Frühe Erwachsenenzeit Margarita Sabaschnikow beschäftigte sich mit der Analogie des Farbspektrums und der Tonskala, mit Goethes Farbenlehre und immer wieder mit der Frage des Sinns der Kultur und des Lebens, das für sie in diesen Jahren ohne Grund und Richtung verlief. Ihre ernsthafte Auseinandersetzung mit den Themen des Daseins und des Materialismus führte sie zu Darwin und Haeckel und von da zu Du Bois-Reymonds Grenzen der Naturerkenntnis. Antworten auf ihre Fragen konnte sie nicht finden. Einzig im Objektiv-Absoluten der Mathematik fand Sabaschnikow Halt. Der Maler Mussatow ermutigte sie, zwei ihrer Porträtbilder zu der Ausstellung Moskauer Maler einzureichen. Sie hatte damit ihren ersten durchschlagenden Erfolg. Eine Teilnahme an der Ausstellung Welt der Kunst in St. Petersburg und in Paris folgten. Bei einer Abendgesellschaft im Hause des Kunstsammlers Sergei Schtschukin lernte sie den Dichter und Maler Maximilian Woloschin kennen. Sie gelangte in die Kreise der russischen Symbolisten um Andrei Bely, Waleri Brjussow, Konstantin Balmont und andere. 1903 reiste sie erneut nach Paris. Dort hatte sie Gelegenheit im Atelier eines befreundeten Malers zu arbeiten. Maximilian Woloschin, ebenfalls in Paris, führte sie in die Pariser Künstlerkreise ein, wo sie Odilon Redon kennenlernte. Während ihres erneuten Auslandsaufenthalts in Westeuropa 1904/05 brach in Russland die Revolution aus, wodurch Margarita Sabaschnikow vorübergehend an ihrer Rückkehr gehindert wurde. In dieser Zeit lernte sie Rudolf Steiner und seine Weltanschauung kennen. Hier fand sie Antworten auf ihre Lebensfragen, reiste zu vielen seiner Vorträge in verschiedenen europäischen Städten und lernte ihn schließlich persönlich kennen. 1906 heiratete sie Maximilian Woloschin. Nach einem kurzen Aufenthalt in Koktebel, an der Nordküste der Krim, beabsichtigten sie nach München überzusiedeln. Die Begegnung mit dem Dichter Wjatscheslaw Iwanow in St. Petersburg, der für sie seit Jahren eine Welt bedeutete, in der sie ihre geistige Heimat fand, machte dieses Vorhaben zunichte. „In der Weltanschauung von Wjatscheslaw Iwanow vereinigt sich das griechische Erleben der Geistigkeit in der Natur mit dem Christentum. In dieser Beziehung stand er für mich höher als Nietzsche, dessen Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik eine entscheidende Wirkung auf mich ausgeübt hatte.[…] dass ich ihn bald kennenlernen sollte, bedeutete für mich eine atemberaubende Aussicht“ Ihre wachsende Berühmtheit und die vielen Kontakte ihres Mannes ermöglichten schnell die Aufnahme in die St. Petersburger Künstlerkreise. Sie trafen unter anderen auf den Dichter Alexei Remisow, den Maler Konstantin Somow, den sie bereits aus Paris kannten, den Philosophen Nikolai Berdjajew und den Schriftsteller Alexander Blok. Von einer Kunstzeitschrift wurden Porträts von Alexei Remisow und Michail Kusmin bestellt, die Woloschin in Kohle zeichnete. Ihre literarischen Versuche förderte Iwanow nachhaltig und ermutigte sie, diese öffentlich vorzutragen. Durch diese Zusammenarbeit entwickelte sich ein ambivalentes Liebesverhältnis, das zwangsläufig zu einem Störfaktor ihrer Ehe wurde. Bei einem Berlinaufenthalt 1908 entschied sie sich vorerst in Deutschland zu bleiben, um über ihr Privatleben Klarheit zu bekommen. In der folgenden Zeit reiste Margarita Woloschin durch Europa, um die Vorträge Rudolf Steiners zu hören, die er in verschiedenen Städten hielt. Um Wjatscheslaw Iwanow nahe zu sein, kehrte sie schließlich zurück nach St. Petersburg. Zu ihrer Enttäuschung heiratete er aber seine Stieftochter Wera. Woloschin zog sich darauf von allen gesellschaftlichen Begegnungen zurück, lebte ganz für sich in ihrem Atelier, hatte kaum Kontakte zur Außenwelt. Sie begann eine Lehre bei dem berühmten Ikonenmaler Tjulin und begegnete dem Komponisten Nikolai Medtner, von dem sie ein Porträt malte. Ihre literarischen Aktivitäten erweiterte sie durch die Übersetzung von Meister Eckharts Werken ins Russische. An eine Veröffentlichung dachte sie zuerst nicht, nahm aber das Angebot des Verlages Musaget zur Publikation an. Eine kleine Erbschaft verlieh ihr größere Unabhängigkeit, was ihre Reisefreudigkeit wieder aufleben ließ. Sie mietete in Paris ein Atelier, wollte den Winter in Rom verbringen, blieb dann aber in München. Ein anderes Mal unterbrach sie die Rückreise von Prag nach Paris und blieb in Stuttgart, um ein bestimmtes Buch über die Mystiker zu lesen, das sie für das Vorwort zu ihrer Eckhart-Übersetzung benötigte. „Mein unruhiger Lebenswandel war aber nur ein Abbild meines inneren Zustandes. Ich war schon achtundzwanzig Jahre alt, war als Dichterin und als Malerin anerkannt und wußte meinen Weg doch noch nicht.“ Mittleres Lebensalter 1911 wählte Margarita Woloschin München als ihren Wohnsitz, weil sie dem Umfeld Rudolf Steiners nahe sein wollte. In diesen Kreisen traf sie auf den Grafen Otto von Lerchenfeld, Christian Morgenstern, Albert Steffen und andere. Die Arbeit an ihrem Triptychon Drei Opfer unterbrach sie im März 1911 wegen einer schweren Erkrankung ihrer Mutter, um nach Moskau zu fahren. Sie blieb aber nur wenige Tage dort. Steiners Vortragsreihe in Helsingfors wollte sie nicht vermissen. In München sollte für die Mysteriendramen Steiners und die sonstigen kulturellen Veranstaltungen der anthroposophischen Bewegung ein adäquates Gebäude errichtet werden. Woloschin wurde angeboten darin ihr Atelier einzurichten. Sie lehnte aber ab. Insgesamt wurden die Pläne für den Bau nicht genehmigt. Das Vorhaben sollte bald darauf in der Schweiz begonnen werden. Als 1914 in Dornach der Bau des ersten Goetheanum begann, war Margarita Woloschin zunächst mit vielen anderen Künstlern aus unterschiedlichen Ländern als Schnitzerin tätig. Ihnen oblag es, die Kapitelle der vielen Säulen, die die Doppelkuppel des ganz aus Holz bestehenden Baues trugen, zu schnitzen. Später war sie an den Deckenmalereien der kleinen Kuppel beteiligt. „Das Leben in Dornach gestaltete sich so, daß man immer in gemeinsamer Arbeit eingespannt war. Der Tag verlief mit Schnitzen, Malen, Üben und Proben für die Eurythmie und einzelne Szenen der Faust-Aufführung.…“ Im Sommer brach der Erste Weltkrieg aus. Geldtransfers aus Russland wurden immer spärlicher, was ihren Mann Maximilian veranlasste, als Journalist nach Paris zu gehen. Es sollte ihr letzter Abschied sein. Nach Beendigung ihrer Arbeit an der Kuppel fuhr Woloschin 1917 zurück nach Russland und geriet in das Chaos der Revolution. Zusammen mit Bely und Iwanow unterrichtete sie Arbeiter und Bauern in Kunst und Literatur. Sie wurde Mitarbeiterin im Volkskommissariat für Theaterwesen und Bildung. Sie konnte aber nicht produktiv arbeiten, weil den ständig wechselnden Behörden die Zuständigkeiten fehlten und es an Wichtigem für das tägliche Leben mangelte. Nach einer schweren Typhuserkrankung 1920 gab sie Malunterricht an einer gerade gegründeten Schule für hochbegabte Waisenkinder. Auch diese Initiative misslang wegen mangelnder bürokratischer Erfahrungen einer im Entstehen begriffenen neuen Verwaltung. In St. Petersburg wurde ihr im Kommissariat des Äußeren eine Stelle in der Bibliothek für ausländische Literatur angeboten, die bald darauf wegen der gleichen behördlichen Unzulänglichkeiten gekündigt wurde. Zurück in Moskau konnte Woloschin für einen Verleger eine Serie von Porträtzeichnungen bekannter Persönlichkeiten, unter anderem auch von Michael Tschechow fertigen. Später traf sie ihn öfter in Stuttgart, Berlin und am Ammersee. Im August 1922 erhielt sie die lange beantragte Genehmigung zur Ausreise in die Niederlande, von wo sie nach Dornach weiterreiste. Kurz vor ihrer Abreise erreichte sie die Mitteilung vom brennenden Goetheanum. Wegen politischer Komplikationen zwischen der Schweiz und Russland musste sie nach einem halben Jahr die Schweiz wieder verlassen. Durch eine Einladung der Familie Lory Maier-Smits konnte sie nach Deutschland einreisen und übersiedelte 1924 nach Einsingen bei Ulm. Ihr Lungenleiden flammte wieder auf, worauf ihre Gastfamilie ihr den Aufenthalt in einer Stuttgarter Klinik ermöglichte. Stuttgart sollte von da an ihr neues Zuhause werden. Zweite Lebenshälfte Woloschins Autobiographie Die grüne Schlange reicht bis zu ihrer Übersiedlung nach Stuttgart. Eine Fortsetzung schien zunächst nicht geplant. Notizen und Aufzeichnungen aus ihrem Nachlass lassen allerdings darauf schließen, dass sie mit fortgeschrittenem Alter doch zu einem zweiten Band neigte. Dass es dennoch nicht dazu gekommen ist, wird ihren reduzierten Kräften zugeschrieben, die sie nur noch für die Malerei, ihrer eigentlichen Aufgabe, verwenden wollte. Aufgewachsen mit den russisch-orthodoxen Riten und der schon als Kind erlebten Nähe zur Religion in Elternhaus und Erziehung spiegelten sich diese Erlebnisse nun in einer neuen Schaffensphase wider. Mit großer Bestimmtheit widmete sie sich christlichen Themen. In der zweiten Hälfte der 1920er Jahre entstanden eine Reihe Bilder mit biblischen Motiven. Sie lernte die 1922 gegründete Christengemeinschaft kennen und malte Altarbilder für die neu entstehenden Gemeinden. Während eines Aufenthaltes in Freiburg ergab sich unvorhergesehen die Möglichkeit, einen Ausflug nach Dornach zu machen. Hier konnte sie viele lange nicht gesehene Freunde wiedertreffen. In den darauffolgenden Jahren hatte sie immer wieder Gelegenheit, nach Dornach zu fahren und in den 1930er Jahren stand für sie sogar ein eigenes Atelier in der Nähe des Goetheanum zur Verfügung. In Stuttgart gab sie Malkurse, darunter auch einen für Lehrer an der neu gegründeten Waldorfschule. Aus dieser Tätigkeit entstand die Idee, eine Malschule mit ordentlichem Curriculum zu gründen. Räumlichkeiten wurden angeboten, Lehrer für den Unterricht standen zur Verfügung. Nach langem Ringen entschied sich Woloschin aber für ihren künstlerischen Weg. Wenige Jahre danach sind einige ihrer Bilder als entartet vernichtet worden. Die politische Lage wurde immer bedrückender und die Machtübernahme der Nationalsozialisten empfand sie als Beginn eines „dunklen Zeitalters“. Die Berichte aus Russland waren nicht weniger düster. Ihre Freunde in St. Petersburg und Moskau waren entweder tot oder verhaftet und in Lagern interniert. 1932 erhielt sie Nachricht vom Tod ihres Gatten Maximilian Woloschin, der inzwischen mit Maria Stepanowna Sabolozkaja verheiratet gewesen war und den sie seit 1914 nicht mehr gesehen hatte. Ein Jahr später starb ihre Mutter. Margarita Woloschin war auch in ihren späteren Jahren nicht von sesshafter Natur. Immer noch reiste sie ihren Möglichkeiten entsprechend gerne und viel. Sie tat es, um Kurse zu geben, Vorträge zu halten oder um an Tagungen teilzunehmen. In ihrem 56. Lebensjahr unternahm sie eine Reise zu den Stätten ihrer Kindheit und Jugend und fuhr über Rom nach Sizilien. Es war ihre letzte große Unternehmung. Ende der dreißiger Jahre wurde Woloschin von den Behörden vor die Wahl gestellt, nach Russland zurückzukehren oder in ein Internierungslager gebracht zu werden. Freunde erwirkten für sie im letzten Augenblick eine Legalisierung ihres weiteren Aufenthaltes unter der Bedingung der regelmäßigen Meldepflicht bei der Gestapo. Zu Beginn der Luftangriffe auf Stuttgart kam sie mit anderen in einem Dorf im nördlichen Schwarzwald unter, wo sie mit der Arbeit an ihrer Autobiografie begann. Gegen Ende des Krieges musste sie wegen ihres russischen Passes erneut eine Verhaftung befürchten. Freunde nahmen sie auf und gewährten ihr Unterschlupf. Den Winter 1945/46 verbrachte die Malerin bereits wieder in Stuttgart. In den Nachkriegsjahren gab Margarita Woloschin Kurse am anthroposophischen Lehrerseminar, hielt Vorträge an der Eurythmieschule, wirkte bei Berufsorientierungskursen mit und erzählte den Kindern in der Schule. Daneben bewältigte sie den täglichen Strom von Besuchern. Man suchte ihren Rat und ihre Anteilnahme, wollte von ihr Begebenheiten aus der Vergangenheit geschildert wissen und man bat sie an verschiedenen Gremien und Sitzungen beratend teilzunehmen. Zwei Jahre nach ihrem siebzigsten Geburtstag erschien ihre Autobiografie bei der Deutschen Verlagsanstalt. Ihre weiteren schriftstellerischen Aktivitäten flossen in biografischen Darstellungen über Michael Tschechow, Michail Lomonossow, Lew Tolstoi, Georg von Albrecht und vielen anderen ein. Dennoch war ihr eigentliches Betätigungsfeld die Malerei. Auch im höheren Alter malte sie täglich, sofern die vielen Verpflichtungen, Besucher und Krankheitsphasen es zuließen. „Ich fühle, daß mit dem allmählichen Schwund des Tastsinns aus beiden Händen, die mir immer so gute Diener waren, wie zwei helfende Wesen, die unmittelbar Anschluß an das Herz hatten und besser wußten als ich, was zu geschehen hat […] meine Laufbahn als Malerin zu Ende gehen.“ Dieser Ausspruch der Künstlerin aus ihren späten 80er Jahren ist kennzeichnend für die beginnende Abnahme ihrer physischen Kräfte. Ein Nachlassen ihres Hör- und Sehvermögens kam hinzu. Der Umzug in ein Altersheim war unausweichlich geworden. Ihre Befürchtung „…jetzt wird mir meine Muse endgültig davonlaufen,“ traf allerdings nicht ein. Auch hier dominierte eine Staffelei ihr Zimmer. Ihr letztes großes Werk, Orpheus, konnte sie nicht mehr vollenden. Im November 1972 wurde in Baden-Baden die Ausstellung Russischer Realismus 1850–1900 eröffnet. Viele Bilder von Künstlern, die Woloschin aus ihrer frühen Zeit als junge Malerin kannte, begegneten ihr hier wieder. Margarita Wassiljewna Woloschin-Sabaschnikow starb ein Jahr später am 2. November 1973. |
G;|Werner Kraft (* 4. Mai 1896 in Braunschweig; † 14. Juni 1991 in Jerusalem) war ein deutsch-israelischer Bibliothekar, Literaturwissenschaftler und Schriftsteller jüdischer Herkunft. Er lebte nach seiner Emigration aus Hannover seit 1934 bis zu seinem Tod in Jerusalem und verkörperte als ausschließlich deutsch schreibender Schriftsteller neben seinen Freunden Gershom Scholem, Ludwig Strauss und Ernst Simon das „Leben der deutschen Sprache in Jerusalem“.  Herkunft Werner Kraft stammt sowohl von mütterlicher als auch väterlicher Seite aus einer jüdischen Familie. „Mein Vater war ein guter Mann, und mir war er alles. Er stammt aus Calbe an der Saale“, schreibt er zu Beginn seiner Erinnerungen „Spiegelung der Jugend“. „Meine Mutter stammt aus Hannover. Sie war kraftvoll. Weil mein Vater in den Geschäften kein Glück hatte, lag die Sorge für die Familie auf ihr.“ Eduard Kraft (1855–1916) lebte als Kaufmann zunächst in Elberfeld, ihn „besuchte die Schwermut, gerade weil er so freudig war und lange am Rhein gelebt hatte“. Die Mutter Else, geb. Isenstein (1868–1923) war die Tochter des hannoverschen Kaufmanns Julius M. Isenstein (1834–1914) und dessen Frau Anna Isenstein, geb. Rosenhain (1839–1926), deren Grab auf dem Jüdischen Friedhof an der Strangriede erhalten ist. Das großväterliche „Seiden-, Manufaktur- und Modewaarengeschäft I.M. Isenstein“ befand sich von 1871 bis 1881 im Zentrum Hannovers, in der Packhofstraße 13, (vorher, ab 1866, in der Seilwinderstraße 12). Die „Hannoversche Holzstifte-Fabrik Isenstein“, die ebenfalls dem Großvater gehörte, lag in der hannoverschen Oststadt (in der Cellerstraße 135, ab 1887 in der Nikolaistraße 14 und 1909–1914 in der Steinriede 4). 1896 betrieb der Vater Eduard Kraft in der Innenstadt von Braunschweig, im Bohlweg 39/40 (Ecke Hagenscharrn), eine „Glas-, Porzellan- und Steingut-, Gold- und Spielwarenhandlung“. Es ist Geburtshaus von Werner Kraft. Kindheit, Jugend und Schulzeit In Hannover wohnte die Familie Kraft hauptsächlich im Stadtteil Oststadt: Rambergstraße, Alte Celler Heerstraße, Lavesstraße und Fundstraße lauteten die Adressen. Im Gegensatz zu seinem eher praktisch veranlagten zwei Jahre älteren Bruder Fritz Kraft (1894–1917), entwickelte sich beim verträumten Werner die Leidenschaft fürs Lesen: Von 1906 bis 1914 besuchte er die Leibnizschule in der Alten Celler Heerstraße (neben dem Gerichtsgefängnis, am heutigen Weißekreuzplatz) und legte im Jahre 1914 das Abitur ab. Zu seinen Mitschülern gehörten u.a. Ernst Blumenthal (später Kaufmann in Stockholm) und der spätere Arzt Harald Berkowitz. In seinen Erinnerungen schrieb Kraft über seine Schulzeit: Die Lektüre des Kindes und Jugendlichen Werner Kraft wandelte sich allmählich in einer bestimmten Richtung: Militärzeit, Studium und Ausbildung zum Bibliothekar In der Buchhandlung Ludwig Ey am hannoverschen Steintor machte er 1913 die Bekanntschaft von Theodor Lessing, der dem Schüler entscheidende Anstöße gab und mit dem er bis zu dessen Tod 1933 verbunden bleiben sollte. Lessing vermittelte auch Krafts erste Veröffentlichung in der von Franz Pfemfert herausgegebenen Zeitschrift Die Aktion, eine Rezension von Rudolf Borchardts Gedicht Wannsee und Stefan Georges Gedichtband Der Stern des Bundes. Ein halbes Jahr lang versuchte er sich in einer Lehre als Bankkaufmann bei der Dresdner Bank in Hannover, deren Direktor Julius L. Isenstein (1856–1929) ein Verwandter mütterlicherseits war: 1915 folgte in Berlin der Beginn des Studiums der deutschen und französischen Philologie sowie der Philosophie zusammen mit seinem Vetter, dem Lyriker Paul Kraft (1896–1922). In Berlin schloss er auch Freundschaft mit Walter Benjamin und Gerhard (Gershom) Scholem. Hier traf er erstmals persönlich den von ihm verehrten Schriftsteller Rudolf Borchardt. 1916 wurde er Soldat, allerdings blieb ihm das sogenannte Stahlbad an der Front erspart. 1916 bis 1919 diente er als Sanitätssoldat in Hannover, die überwiegende Zeit in den Wahrendorffschen Anstalten, im sog. Lazarett für Kriegshysteriker und Kriegsneurotiker (heute Klinikum Wahrendorff) in Ilten bei Hannover, ein Dienst, der den Zwanzigjährigen an den Rand des Selbstmords brachte. Überlebenshilfe waren ihm die Freundschaft mit Theodor Lessing und die Lektüre der Zeitschrift Die Fackel des Wiener Satirikers Karl Kraus, sowie der Bücher von Rudolf Borchardt – Kraus und Borchardt wurden bald seine geistigen Leitsterne – beide bekanntlich Männer jüdischer Herkunft, die sich zu dieser ihrer Herkunft nur schwer bekennen mochten: Sein älterer Bruder Fritz Kraft, schon früh in der zionistischen Bewegung in Hannover aktiv, wurde ebenfalls Soldat. Als Angehöriger des kaiserlichen Levantekorps kämpfte er gegen britische Truppen in Palästina. 1917 kehrte er nahe Jerusalem von einem Patrouillengang nicht zurück und blieb vermisst. Nach dem Krieg konnte Werner Kraft 1919 bis 1920 sein Studium zusammen mit den Schwestern Toni und Erna Halle, die er 1916 im Kreis um Gerhard Scholem in Jena kennengelernt hatte, in Freiburg im Breisgau fortsetzen; u.a. hörte er Philosophie bei Edmund Husserl und Martin Heidegger: Zwecks Erlernung eines Brotberufs absolvierte er 1920 bis 1926 eine Ausbildung zum Bibliothekar, zunächst des gehobenen Dienstes. 1922 heiratete er Erna Halle (1923 wurde ihr Sohn Paul Caspar [später: Shaul] geboren). 1922 bis 1926 war er an der Deutschen Bücherei in Leipzig tätig. In Leipzig wohnten Werner und Erna Kraft zusammen mit Ernas Schwester Toni Halle – damals Lehrerin an der Leipziger Israelitischen Mädchenschule – am Floßplatz. 1925 promovierte er in Frankfurt am Main über Die Päpstin Johanna, eine motivgeschichtliche Untersuchung (mit Schwerpunkt auf Rudolf Borchardts Drama 'Verkündigung') bei Professor Franz Schultz (1877–1950), bei dem Walter Benjamin die Habilitation im selben Jahr misslang, und absolvierte das Examen zum höheren Bibliotheksdienst. Bibliotheksrat in Hannover Seine Stelle an der Deutschen Bücherei in Leipzig wurde nicht verlängert, aber 1928 hatte - für ihn überraschend - seine Bewerbung an der Vormals Königlichen und Provinzial-Bibliothek (der heutigen Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bibliothek) in seiner Heimatstadt Hannover Erfolg. Nachdem zuvor seine Bewerbung bei der Staatsbibliothek in Lissabon für eine Stelle in Coimbra vergeblich gewesen war, schrieb er in seinen Erinnerungen: Er wurde Bibliotheksrat unter Direktor Otto Heinrich May, der seine Einstellung wohl aus antisemitischen Gründen zwar nicht befürwortet hatte, sie wurde aber seitens des Provinzialausschusses, der obersten Dienstbehörde, durchgesetzt. Die größer gewordene Familie – 1929 wurde die Tochter Else (später Alisa) geboren – bezog eine Neubauwohnung in der hannoverschen Tiestestraße nahe dem Geibelplatz. Es folgten fünf vielleicht glückliche, auf jeden Fall zufriedene Jahre in Hannover. Er nahm die freundschaftliche Verbindung zu Theodor Lessing wieder auf, lernte den Eckernförder Schriftsteller Wilhelm Lehmann kennen, in Berlin besuchte er die verehrte Dichterin Else Lasker-Schüler und die Vorlesungen von Karl Kraus. Und er begann in dieser Zeit eine Reihe von Zeitschriftenaufsätzen zu veröffentlichen über seine 'Favoriten' unter den deutschen Dichtern wie etwa den schwäbischen Bauerndichter Christian Wagner, Goethe, Stefan George, Karl Kraus, Franz Kafka und den baltendeutscher Aufklärer Carl Gustav Jochmann, dessen vergessenes Werk er in der Bibliothek wiederentdeckte. Trotzdem fühlte sich der jüdische Bibliotheksrat isoliert: Entlassung aus dem Dienst und Emigration - Exil und Heimat in Jerusalem 1933 als Jude aus dem Dienst entlassen nach dem sog. Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums, emigrierte er mit seiner Familie über Stockholm und London zunächst nach Paris, wo er den aus Czernowitz stammenden, späteren französischen Marx-Herausgeber Maximilien Rubel kennenlernte. Sie gaben zusammen eine kleine Zeitschrift heraus. In der Bibliothèque nationale traf er zufällig mit Walter Benjamin zusammen, jetzt ebenfalls Exilant: Bald stellten sie fest, dass sie sich mit demselben Schriftsteller befassten: mit Franz Kafka. Benjamin schrieb 1934 an seinen Freund Gershom Scholem in Jerusalem: Ab 1934 lebte er mit seiner Familie in Jerusalem, in der Alfasi Street im Stadtteil Rehavia. Nur mühsam fand er Arbeit in seinem Brotberuf als Bibliothekar (1936–1942 als Bibliothekar am Centre de Culture Française und von 1947 bis 1956 in der Antikenabteilung des Rockefeller Museums) und konnte sich erst nach seiner Pensionierung ab 1956 als freier Schriftsteller und Essayist deutscher Sprache etablieren. In Jerusalem und Tel Aviv besaß er einen Freundeskreis überwiegend deutschsprachiger Juden (meist "Jeckes"), zu denen u.a. Gershom Scholem, der Lyriker Ludwig Strauß, der Pädagoge Ernst Simon, der "straßenfegende Philosoph" Gustav Steinschneider (1899–1981, Enkel des Begründers der wissenschaftlichen hebräischen Bibliographie Moritz Steinschneider), dessen Ehefrau Toni Halle (1890–1964) (Gründerin und Direktorin des "Neuen Gymnasiums" in Tel Aviv, der heutigen Tichon Hadash High School), der Freund Ludwig Wittgensteins und Architekt Paul Engelmann, Else Lasker-Schüler, Martin Buber, der Bibliothekar Harry Timar und der Lyriker Tuvia Rübner gehörten. Ein Brief, den der Schweizer Diplomat und Historiker Carl Jacob Burckhardt am 19. November 1962 an seinen Freund, den Schriftsteller Max Rychner, schrieb, gibt die Stimmung in diesem Kreis deutsch-jüdischer Emigranten gut wieder. Es handelt sich um einen Bericht über Burckhardts Israel-Besuch im Herbst 1962 und schildert ein Treffen mit Gershom Scholem, Ernst Simon, Werner Kraft und Kurt Blumenfeld in Scholems Bibliothek in Rehavia: "Dort, in der wertvollen Bibliothek des bis aufs letzte erfahrenen, witzigen [Gershom] Scholem sind ein Dutzend Professoren und Schriftsteller versammelt, alle sprechen deutsch, alle sprechen von Deutschland, von deutschen Erinnerungen, deutscher Literatur, ja deutscher Literaturpolitik [...], sie vernichten ein jeder irgend einen einstigen oder noch lebenden Gegner und erheben irgend einen Auserwählten in die Sterne. Es ist wie es vor 50 Jahren war, sie wissen ebensoviel wie damals, sie sind brillant und formulieren schlagend, aber etwas ganz Neues ist hinzugekommen, das sie nicht wahrhaben wollen: das Heimweh, ein tiefes Heimweh, das selbst ihre kritischen Äußerungen verklärt. Sogar der zurückhaltend distinguierte W[erner] Kraft, der blanke Krausianer, der Dich [= Rychner] mit vielen andern grüßen läßt, ist wehmütig und seine Definitionen aus scharfkantigem Material werden ganz weich an den Rändern. Bei den Menschen dieses Kreises ist keinerlei Rachsucht zu finden. Es ist nicht bei allen so." Schriftsteller und Essayist deutscher Sprache in Jerusalem Nach Deutschland oder gar nach Hannover kehrte Werner Kraft – außer auf zahlreichen Reisen – nicht zurück; er wurde 1948 israelischer Staatsbürger. Etliche Besucher aus Deutschland haben die "verwunschen zugewachsene Wohnung zu ebener Erde, zu der eine Außentreppe steil hinab" von der Alfasi Street führte, beschrieben. Als israelischer Staatsbürger und deutscher Dichter, der "nicht mehr den Anschluß an die hebräische Dichtung und Literatur gefunden" hatte, lebte er ein Leben in Jerusalem, das ausschließlich der deutschen Sprache gewidmet blieb. Sein Freund, der Pädagoge Rudolf Lennert, charakterisierte diese ‚Insel-Existenz‘ in einem Aufsatz in der Zeitschrift "Neue Sammlung", eine Besprechung von Krafts Essay-Bänden "Wort und Gedanke" und "Augenblicke der Dichtung", folgendermaßen: Diese seit den 1970er Jahren immer zahlreicher werdenden Besucher aus Deutschland, zu denen u.a. der Bibliothekar Paul Raabe, der Literaturwissenschaftler und Übersetzer Friedhelm Kemp (München), der Karl-Kraus-Herausgeber und Museumsleiter Friedrich Pfäfflin (München/Marbach), der Germanist und Kritiker Jörg Drews (Bielefeld/München) - er sorgte zwischen 1974 und 1986 für das Erscheinen von vier Büchern Krafts im Münchener Verlag edition text + kritik - , der Germanist Uwe Pörksen (Freiburg/Breisgau), der Schriftsteller Peter Härtling, der Cheflektor des Münchner C. H. Beck-Verlags Ernst-Peter Wieckenberg, der Kölner Fotograf Georg Heusch und der Sammler Volker Kahmen, die späteren Gründer des Werner Kraft-Archivs (s.u.), der Münchner Literaturwissenschaftler und Jurist Reinhard Merkel, die Fotografin Herlinde Koelbl, die Journalistin Ariane Thomalla, der Lüneburger Literaturwissenschaftler Werner H. Preuß, der Braunschweiger Dichter Georg Oswald Cott und der Göttinger Verleger Thedel von Wallmoden gehörten, förderten in der einen oder anderen Weise die Veröffentlichung von Krafts Werken in Deutschland. Als einem in Jerusalem lebenden Schriftsteller deutscher Sprache waren Werner Kraft die regelmäßigen Reisen nach Deutschland, aber auch nach Österreich, in die Schweiz und andere Länder Mitteleuropas, wichtig, in denen seine Freunde lebten und wo er erste Verlagsverbindungen anzuknüpfen versuchte, denn seine Schubladen in der Alfasi Street waren sozusagen voller Manuskripte, entstanden in der Zeit der Isolation 1934 bis 1945. Seit der ersten Europa-Reise nach dem Krieg im Jahre 1951, die ihn und Ehefrau Erna nach Lüneburg (zum Freund Hubert Breitenbach), Hannover (zur Regelung seiner Pensionsansprüche) und Klein-Wittensee (zu Wilhelm Lehmann) führte, wiederholten sich diese mehrmonatigen Reisen regelmäßig zwischen 1953 und 1982. Mit zahlreichen Schriftstellern, Freunden und Bekannten, aber auch Unbekannten, die ihm nach der Lektüre seiner Artikel, Aufsätze oder Bücher nach Jerusalem schrieben, begann er eine lebhafte Korrespondenz. Häufig schrieb er seine Briefe auf Aerogrammen, diesen federleichten Luftpostbriefen, deren Platz begrenzt war und deren Ränder er in seiner gut lesbaren Handschrift auch noch mit Bemerkungen versah Seit 1955 sind über 40 Buchveröffentlichungen im deutschsprachigen Raum zu verzeichnen: Lyrik, Prosa, Essays, Literaturkritik (über Kraus, Borchardt, Kafka, Jochmann, Hofmannsthal, George, Heine, Goethe). Seine Autobiographie Spiegelung der Jugend erschien 1973. Er war Herausgeber von Schriften von Heine, Kraus, Lasker-Schüler, Ludwig Strauß, Johann Gottfried Seume und Carl Gustav Jochmann. Ca. 500 Veröffentlichungen in deutschsprachigen Zeitschriften und Zeitungen sind in der Werner-Kraft-Bibliographie (s.u.) verzeichnet: Kritiken, Essays, Gedichte, Prosa und Aphorismen. Zahlreiche Preise und Ehrungen krönten in seinen späteren Jahren sein Lebenswerk, so u.a. 1966 der Literaturpreis der Bayerischen Akademie der Schönen Künste und 1971 der Sigmund-Freud-Preis für wissenschaftliche Prosa der Deutschen Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung in Darmstadt. Werner Kraft starb im 'biblischen Alter' von 95 Jahren. Sein Grab befindet sich auf dem Friedhof des Kibbuz Tzora (20 km von Jerusalem entfernt bei Bet Schemesch), in dem seine Tochter Alisa Tibon lebt. 1983 gründeten deutsche Leser seiner Werke (um Georg Heusch und Volker Kahmen) das Werner Kraft Archiv e.V. in Köln und Rheinbach, das sich seit 2003 im Literatur- und Kunstinstitut Hombroich (Stiftung Insel Hombroich) in Neuss befindet, seit 1996 auch als Teilnachlass im Deutschen Literaturarchiv Marbach. Im Georg Heusch Verlag erschienen zwischen 1983 und 1996 in neun Bänden und einer Schallplatte Gesammelte Werke in Einzelausgaben. In der Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bibliothek in Hannover, seiner Arbeitsstätte 1928 bis 1933, verzeichnet seit 2003 die Werner Kraft-Bibliographie als Online-Datenbank die Literatur von und über Werner Kraft (s. Weblinks). Ausstellungen zu seiner Biographie und seinem Werk fanden 1986, 1996, 2000 und 2008 in Hannover, Marbach, Berlin, Wolfenbüttel, Braunschweig und Leipzig statt. Im Jahre 1997 benannte die Landeshauptstadt Hannover eine Straße im Stadtteil Misburg - in der Nähe von Heinrich-Böll-Weg und Kafkastraße (was ihn gefreut hätte) - nach Werner Kraft. Sie ist allerdings zurzeit (2015) noch nicht bebaut (Zugang von der Stadtbahn-Station "Kafkastraße" der Linie 7). Als Maxime eines 'israelischen Staatsbürgers deutscher Sprache' beschrieb Werner Kraft in seinen Erinnerungen "Spiegelung der Jugend" seine Lebenserfahrung mit folgenden Worten: |
G;Bartolo Colón (* 24. Mai 1973 in Altamira, Puerto Plata) mit Spitznamen Big Sexy, ist ein dominikanischer Baseballspieler, der als Starting Pitcher in der Major League Baseball bei den New York Mets aktiv ist. Die Mets sind bereits das achte Franchise, bei dem Colón seit seinem MLB–Debüt 1997 unter Vertrag steht. Seit Beginn der MLB-Saison 2016 ist Colón der älteste aktive Spieler in den Major Leagues. Zudem ist der letzte in der MLB verbliebene Spieler der noch für die Montreal Expos aktiv war, welche 2005 nach Washington zogen. Den ersten Homerun seiner Karriere schlug er am 7. Mai 2016. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war Colón 42 Jahre und 349 Tage alt und ist damit der älteste Spieler der MLB–Geschichte zum Zeitpunkt seines ersten Homeruns. Colón ist viermaliger All-Star und Sieger des Cy Young Award der American League 2005.   Minor Leagues Die Cleveland Indians verpflichteten Colón 1993 aus dem Free Agent Status heraus, bei dessen Rookie-Level-Minor League Team, den Burlington Indians, er 1994 erstmals zum Einsatz kam. Bei 12 Starts gelangen ihm sieben Wins bei 4 Losses. 1995 wurde er auf A+-Level zu den Kinston Indians hochgestuft, bei denen er bei 21 Starts mit einem ERA von 1,96 und einer Siegquote von 81,3 % beeindruckte. Nach zwölf Start auf AA-Level bei den Canton-Akron Indians 1996 wurde Colón gegen Ende der Saison erstmals auf Triple-A-Niveau eingesetzt. Sechs Mal war er bei den Buffalo Bisons im Einsatz, allerdings nicht als Starter, sondern als Relief Pitcher. 1997 agierte er dann als Starting Pitcher für die Bisons und erreichte in zehn Einsätzen einen Pitchers-Record von 7:1 und einen ERA von 2,38. Major Leagues Cleveland Indians (1997–2002) Am 04. April 1997 wurde Bartolo Colón von den Indians erstmals in den Major League Kader berufen. Er debütierte beim Auswärtsspiel gegen die Anaheim Angels, bei dem er als Starter fünf Innings pitchte. Dabei ließ er vier gegnerische Runs zu, davon zwei durch einen Two-Run-Homerun von Gary Disarcina. Bis zum Ende der Saison 1997 kam Colón 19 Mal zum Einsatz, davon 17 Mal als Starter und zwei Mal als Reliefer. Zudem pitchte er sein erstes komplettes Spiel. Nach einem ERA von 5,65 im Vorjahr steigerte sich Colón in der Spielzeit 1998 auf 3,71 und hatte mit 60,9 % erstmals eine positive Win-Loss-Bilanz. Er wurde zum ersten von bislang drei All-Star Games eingeladen und verbuchte zudem die ersten zwei Shutouts seiner MLB-Karriere. Die Indians gewannen die Central Division der American League mit neun Spielen Vorsprung auf die White Sox und Colón kam in seiner zweiten MLB-Saison zu seinen ersten Play Off Einsätzen. Gegner in der American League Division Series (ALDS) waren die Red Sox, die die Wildcard der AL gewonnen hatten. Colón startete in Spiel 4, pitchte 5,2 Innings und kassierte einen Run. Die Indians gewannen das Spiel, für Colón aber war es eine No-Decision. Cleveland qualifizierte sich für die American League Championship Series (ALCS), bei der Colón in Spiel 3 gegen die Yankees das komplette Spiel durchpitchte. Ihm gelangen drei Strikeouts und er kassierte nur einen Run beim 6:1-Erfolg der Indians, was seinen ersten Win in einem Post Season Spiel bedeutete. Die Yankees gewannen jedoch die ALCS mit 4:2 Spielen und die Saison der Indians war beendet. 1999 verbesserte er seine Siegquote weiter, 18 Wins standen fünf Losses gegenüber und sein ERA blieb konstant. Erstmals landete er zudem in den Top 10 bei der Wahl zum Cy Young Award der American League, bei der er den vierten Rang hinter Pedro Martínez, Mike Mussina und Mariano Rivera belegte. Die Indians dominierten die Regular Season und zogen deutlich in die ALDS 1999 ein. Gegner, wie im Vorjahr, waren die Wildcardgewinner Boston Red Sox, die die Indians überraschend mit 3:2 Siegen aus den Play Offs warfen. Colón startete in zwei der fünf Spiele. Nach einer No Decision in Spiel 1, musste er in Spiel 4 der Serie seinen ersten Loss in einem Post Season Spiel hinnehmen. Er begann das Match als Starter und wurde nach nur einem desaströsen Inning wieder ausgewechselt, nachdem er zwei Homeruns zu lies und sieben Runs kassierte. Allerdings war das gesamte Team an diesem Tag außergewöhnlich schlecht. Die Indians verloren das Spiel mit sage und schreibe 7:23 Runs. In der MLB-Saison 2000 konnte Colón zwar seinen ERA leicht verbessern, kam aber trotzdem nicht an seine Siegquote des Vorjahres heran. Dies lag auch an einer allgemein schwächeren Saison der Indians, die als zweiter der Division hinter den White Sox den Einzug in die Play Offs verpassten. 2001 kamen die Indians wieder stärker durch die Regular Season und kehrten nach einem Jahr Pause wieder in die Play Offs zurück. Colón steuerte mit 14 Wins bei 12 Losses eine fast ausgeglichene Bilanz zum Erfolg der Indians bei und stellte mit 222,1 einen persönlichen Rekord in gepitchten Innings auf. In der ALDS waren die Seattle Mariners der Gegner der Indians. Colón dominierte Spiel 1 als Starting Pitcher mit acht Innings ohne gegnerischen Run, in denen er zehn Strikeouts warf und letztendlich den Win zugesprochen bekam. In Spiel 4 der Serie folgte der zweite Loss seiner Post Season Karriere. Die Mariners gewannen die Serie mit 3:2 und erneut verpasste Colón mit den Indians den Einzug in die ALCS. In der ersten Hälfte der Saison 2002 spielte Colón wieder stärker auf als in den Vorjahren. Mit einem Record von 10–4 (71,4 %) und einem deutlich verbesserten ERA von 2,55 in den Statistiken wurde Colón am 27. Juni 2002 zusammen mit Tim Drew an die Montreal Expos abgegeben. Die Indians bekamen im Gegenzug gleich vier Spieler der Expos (Cliff Lee, Brandon Phillips, Grady Sizemore und Lee Stevens) Colón verlies die Indians nach insgesamt 162 Spielen, davon 160 als Starter und einem Win–Loss von 75–45 (62,5 %) und einem ERA von 3,92. Montreal Expos (2002) Mit dem Wechsel zu den Expos in die National League (NL) war der notorisch schlechte Schlagmann Colón damit konfrontiert, dass es in der NL keine Designated Hitter Regel gibt, und er so regelmäßig selber als Batter antreten musste. Zuvor hatte er bei den Indians nur in Interleague Games schlagen müssen und hatte in 162 Spielen nur 29 Plate Appearances (PA). In der zweiten Saisonhälfte 2002, die er bei den Expos verbrachte, hatte er schließlich 43 PAs, bei denen er immerhin fünf Hits und drei RBI schaffte und sogar einen eigenen Run erzielte. Sein Pitching war konstant zur ersten Saisonhälfte bei den Indians. Auch für die Expos kam er zu einem Record von 10–4 (71,4 %). Nach einem halben Jahr und 17 Starts gaben die Expos Colón im Januar 2003 an die Chicago White Sox ab. Chicago White Sox (2003) Colón kam für die White Sox gleich im ersten Spiel der Saison 2003 gegen die Kansas City Royals zum Einsatz und hatte im Laufe des Jahres mehr Spielanteile als je zuvor. Am Ende standen 35 Spiele mit insgesamt 242 gepitchten Innings. Zudem konnte er erstmals eine ligaweite Statistik für sich entscheiden, da er mit neun Shutouts die meisten aller Spieler der American League schaffte. Die Rückkehr in die AL bedeutete auch die Rückkehr zur Designated Hitter Regel, dass er nur sieben Plate Appearances in der gesamten Saison hatte. Diese allerdings ohne ein einziges Mal auf Base zu kommen. Nach Auslaufen seines Vertrages bei den White Sox am 27. Oktober 2003 befand sich Colón im Free Agent Status. Anaheim Angels / Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2004–2007) Am 10. Dezember 2003 sicherten sich die Anaheim Angels die Dienste von Colón, der erstmals ein Jahresgehalt von mehr als zehn Millionen USD bekommen sollte. In der Saison 2004 kam er zu 34 Starts. Am 2. Januar 2005 benannte sich das Team in Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim um. Die Saison 2005 beendete Colón als Pitcher mit den meisten Wins (21) in der American League, was ihm zudem mit 72,4 % die beste Siegquote seiner Karriere bescherte. Nachdem er Mitte der Saison zum zweiten Mal zum All-Star Game eingeladen wurde, folgte zu Saisonende die Auszeichnung mit dem Cy Young Award als bester Pitcher der AL. Auch in der Wahl zum Most Valuable Player der AL bekam Colón erstmals drei Stimmen und landete an Platz 23. In Folge einer Verletzung an der rechten Schulter, die sich Colón in einem Play Off Spiel gegen die Yankees Ende der Saison 2015 zugezogen hatte, verbrachte er die meiste Zeit der Saison 2006 auf der Disabled List. Aufgrund von Schmerzen und wiederkehrenden Entzündungen in der Schulter kam er nur zu zehn Spielen, von denen er nur ein einziges gewinnen konnte. Die Folge war seine bis heute schlechteste Siegquote in einer Saison von 16,7 %. 2007 kam Bartolo Colón wieder zu mehr Spielzeit bei den Angels, schloss die Saison aber nach 18 Starts mit seinem bis dato schlechtesten ERA von 6,34 ab. Am 29. Oktober 2007 wurde Colón nach Vertragsende wieder in den Free Agent Status überführt. Boston Red Sox (2008) Die Boston Red Sox sicherten sich Colóns Dienste am 24. Februar 2008. Bis Ende Mai kam er dort beim Triple-A Team Pawtucket Red Sox, bevor er am 21. Mai 2008 in den MLB-Kader der Red Sox berufen wurde. Dort startete er sieben Mal, bis er im September 2008 von den Red Sox unbefristet ohne Bezahlung suspendiert wurde, nachdem er aus persönlichen Gründen in die Dominikanische Republik reiste und nicht zum vereinbarten Zeitpunkt zurückkehrte. Am 31. Oktober wurde Colón von den Red Sox in den Free Agent Status entlassen. Chicago White Sox (2009) Im Januar 2009 unterschrieb Colón zum zweiten Mal in seinen Karriere einen Vertrag bei den White Sox, bei denen er von Beginn der Saison an in der Starting Rotation war. In 12 Starts zu Saisonbeginn erreichte er bei sechs Losses drei Wins, bevor er erneut durch eine Verletzung außer Gefecht gesetzt wurde und den Rest der Saison nicht mehr einsatzfähig war. Am 16. September 2009 schließlich entließen die White Sox Colón. New York Yankees (2011) Die Saison 2011 verbrachte Colón bei den New York Yankees, dem sechsten Franchise seiner MLB-Karriere. Erstmals seit 2005 kam er hier wieder zu mehr als 100 gepitchten Innings. Nach 26 Starts und drei Einsätzen als Relief Pitcher stand ein ERA von 4,00 bei einer Siegquote von 44,4 %, bevor am 30. Oktober 2011 der erneute Wechsel in den Free Agent Status folgte. Oakland Athletics (2012–2013) Am 24. Januar 2012 unterschrieb Colón einen Vertrag bei den Oakland Athletics, bei denen er in der Saison 2012 erstmals seit 2005 wieder eine zweistellige Anzahl von Wins in einer Saison erreichen konnte. Bei 24 Starts kam er auf einen Pitchers Record von 10-9. Nach Saisonende wurde er erneut in den Free Agent Status entlassen, unterschrieb aber nach nur vier Tagen einen neuen Vertrag bei den A’s. Im Alter von mittlerweile 40 Jahren folgte mit der Spielzeit 2013 eine der stärksten in Colóns Karriere. Mit 18 Wins erreichte er seinen zweitbesten Karrierewert und war nur in der Cy Young Award-Saison 2005 besser. Er konnte zum zweiten Mal in seiner Karriere nach 2002 die ganze Saison ohne Hit by Pitch beenden und war mit drei Shutouts der beste Spieler in dieser Statistik in der American League. Zum dritten Mal nach 1998 und 2005 wurde er zum All-Star Game eingeladen und wurde sechster bei der Wahl zum Cy Young Award. Des Weiteren erreichte mit einem ERA von 2,65 den besten Wert seit 2002. Die A’s erreichten zudem 2013 die Post Season und Colón startete in Spiel 1 der ALDS 2013 gegen die Detroit Tigers. Gleich im ersten Inning ließ er jedoch drei Runs zu und die Tigers gewannen das Spiel mit 3:2 und letztendlich auch die Serie mit 3:2 Spielen. Am 31. Oktober wurde Colón zum sechsten Mal in seiner Karriere in den Free Agent Status entlassen. New York Mets (seit 2014) Die New York Mets sicherten sich die Dienste von Bartolo Colón am 14. Dezember 2013. Für Colón war es nach dem kurzen Abstecher nach Montreal 2002 erst der zweite Vertrag bei einem Team der National League, was ihn nun erneut in die Situation brachte, regelmäßig selber als Schlagmann fungieren zu müssen. In der Saison 2014 spielte er 31 Partien, so viele wie seit 2005 nicht mehr und konnte 15 davon gewinnen und verlor 13. Als Hitter musste er mit einem Schlagdurchschnitt von 3,2 % leben, schaffte aber immerhin zwei Hits und ein Double. Die Regular Season der Spielzeit 2015 kam Colón bei 31 Starts auf 14 Wins bei 13 Losses, und war Starter am Eröffnungstag gegen die Nationals. Die Mets gewannen ihre Division und Colón erreichte zum siebten Mal mit einem seiner Teams die Post Season. In der National League Division Series 2015 gegen die Los Angeles Dodgers kam er gleich drei Mal als Relief Pitcher zum Einsatz, allerdings gingen zwei der drei Spiele verloren. Die Mets qualifizierten sich dennoch nach 3:2 Siegen jedoch für die National League Championship Series 2015 gegen die Chicago Cubs, bei der Colón in Spiel 4 erneut als Relief Pitcher eingesetzt wurde und beim 8:3-Erfolg der Mets der Winning Pitcher war. Die Mets sweepten die Cubs und erreichten die World Series 2015 gegen die Kansas City Royals, bei der Colón erneut drei Mal als Reliefer eingesetzt wurde, zwei Mal davon während Extra Innings. Im letztendlich entscheidenden Spiel 5 der Serie, das die Mets mit 2:7 verloren, stand Colón zum Spielende auf dem Mound. Bartolo Colón begann die Saison 2016 als ältester aktiver Spieler der MLB. Ihm gelang am 7. Mai 2016 der erste Homerun seiner Karriere. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war Colón 42 Jahre und 349 Tage alt. Damit ist er der älteste Spieler der MLB zum Zeitpunkt seines ersten Homeruns. Am 8. Juli 2016 wurde er als Ersatz für den verletzten Madison Bumgarner in den Kader der National League für das MLB All-Star Game 2016 berufen. Es war seine vierte Teilnahme am Midsummer Classic. 
G;Vorlage:Infobox Formel-1-Fahrer/Wartung/Alte Parameter Felipe Massa [fiˈlipi ˈmasɐ] (* 25. April 1981 in São Paulo) ist ein brasilianischer Automobilrennfahrer. Er startet seit 2002 in der Formel 1 und wurde dort 2008 Vizeweltmeister. Von 2006 bis 2013 stand Massa bei Ferrari unter Vertrag. Seit 2014 startet er für Williams.   Anfänge im Motorsport (1990–2001) Im Alter von neun Jahren begann Massa seine Motorsportkarriere im Kartsport. 1998 wechselte er in den Formelsport und wurde Fünfter der brasilianischen Formel Chevrolet. 1999 blieb er in dieser Serie und entschied die Meisterschaft mit drei Siegen aus zehn Rennen für sich. 2000 wechselte Massa nach Europa, wo er bei Cram Competition ein Cockpit für den Formel Renault 2000 Eurocup und die italienische Formel Renault erhielt. Er nahm in beiden Serien an acht Rennen teil und entschied in beiden Meisterschaften die Fahrerwertung für sich. Im Formel Renault 2000 Eurocup setzte er sich mit 140 zu 124 Punkten gegen Charles Zwolsman jr. durch, in der italienischen Formel Renault war er punktgleich mit Raffaele Giammaria. Da mit vier Siegen zwei Rennen mehr als Giammaria gewonnen hatte, entschied Massa das Titelduell für sich. Giammaria hatte zwei Rennen mehr als Massa absolviert. 2001 erhielt Massa ein Cockpit beim Draco Junior Team in der Euro Formel 3000. Er entschied sechs von acht Rennen für sich und gewann die Meisterschaft. Mit 60 zu 32 Punkten hatte er fast doppelt so viel Punkte als der zweitplatzierte Thomas Biagi erzielt. Darüber hinaus nahm er 2001 für das von N.Technology betreute Alfa-Romeo-Werksteam an zwei Veranstaltungen der Tourenwagen-Europameisterschaft teil. Dabei war ein fünfter Platz sein bestes Resultat. Am Jahresende absolvierte Massa für Sauber zudem seine ersten Testfahrten in einem Formel-1-Auto. Formel 1 (seit 2002) Debüt mit Sauber und ein Jahr Testfahrer bei Ferrari (2002–2003) Da Massa Sauber bei den Testfahrten überzeugt hatte, erhielt er für die Formel-1-Weltmeisterschaft 2002 ein Cockpit bei dem Rennstall als Nachfolger von Kimi Räikkönen und Teamkollege von Nick Heidfeld. Massa absolvierte 16 von 17 Rennen und wurde beim Großen Preis der USA durch Heinz-Harald Frentzen ersetzt. Massa kam achtmal in die Top-10 und schied bei den anderen acht Rennen aus. Ein fünfter Platz beim Großen Preis von Spanien war seine beste Platzierung. Mit vier Punkten wurde er 13. in der Fahrerweltmeisterschaft, während Heidfeld mit sieben Punkten Zehnter wurde. 2003 verlor Massa sein Cockpit an Frentzen und blieb als Testfahrer von Ferrari in der Formel 1 aktiv. Rückkehr zu Sauber (2004–2005) 2004 kehrte Massa zu Sauber zurück und wurde Teamkollege von Giancarlo Fisichella. Massa kam in dieser Saison regelmäßiger ins Ziel und schied nur bei vier Rennen aus. Mit einem vierten Platz beim Großen Preis von Belgien wurde er Gesamtzwölfter. Er unterlag Fisichella, der Elfter war, mit 12 zu 22 Punkten. 2005 blieb Massa bei Sauber und erhielt mit dem ehemaligen Weltmeister Jacques Villeneuve einen neuen Teamkollegen. Massas bestes Resultat war erneut ein vierter Platz, den er beim Großen Preis von Kanada erzielte. Massa setzte sich mit 11 zu 9 Punkten intern gegen Villeneuve durch und lag eine Position vor ihm auf dem 13. Gesamtrang. Ferrari (2006–2013) 2006 2006 wechselte Massa als Stammfahrer zu Ferrari und löste seinen Landsmann Rubens Barrichello ab. Massa wurde Teamkollege von Michael Schumacher, der von 2000 bis 2004 mit Ferrari fünfmal die Weltmeisterschaft gewonnen hatte. Nachdem er bei den ersten vier Rennen dreimal in die Top 10 gekommen war, erzielte er beim Großen Preis von Europa als Dritter seine erste Podest-Platzierung in der Formel 1. Fünf Rennen später in den USA wurde er Zweiter. Bei den zwei darauf folgenden Rennen in Frankreich und Deutschland folgten weitere Podest-Platzierungen. Zwei Rennen darauf, beim Großen Preis der Türkei startete Massa erstmals von der Pole-Position und erzielte im Rennen seinen ersten Formel-1-Sieg. Nach einem zweiten Platz beim Großen Preis von Japan gewann er bei seinem Heimrennen in Brasilien erneut. Massa wurde mit 80 Punkten Dritter in der Fahrerweltmeisterschaft und unterlag damit intern Schumacher, der als Zweiter 121 Punkte erzielt hatte. 2007 2007 erhielt Massa mit Räikkönen einen neuen Teamkollegen. Nach den ersten zwölf Rennen lag Massa in der Weltmeisterschaft einen Punkt vor Räikkönen. Massa hatte mit Siegen in Bahrain, Spanien und der Türkei drei Rennen gewonnen, während Räikkönen vier Rennen für sich entschieden hatte. Darüber hinaus stand Massa in Frankreich und Europa als Zweiter sowie in Monaco und den USA als Dritter auf dem Podium. In den letzten fünf Rennen setzte sich Räikkönen mit drei Siegen und zwei dritten Plätzen von Massa ab und gewann die Weltmeisterschaft mit 110 Punkten. Massa wurde in den letzten fünf Rennen in Belgien und Brasilien Zweiter und Dritter beim Großen Preis von China. Mit 94 Punkten erreichte Massa den vierten Rang in der Fahrerwertung. 2008 2008 bildeten Massa und Räikkönen erneut das Ferrari-Fahrerduo. Nach Ausfällen in den ersten beiden Rennen gewann Massa den Großen Preis von Bahrain. Danach folgte ein zweiter Platz in Spanien. Bei den nächsten zwei Grands Prix in der Türkei und in Monaco erzielte er die Pole-Position. Nachdem Massa in der Türkei gewonnen hatte, wurde er Dritter in Monaco. Nach einem fünften Platz beim Großen Preis von Kanada entschied Massa in Frankreich sein drittes Saisonrennen für sich. Er profitierte dabei von einem technischen Defekt am Fahrzeug Räikkönens, der dadurch Zweiter wurde. Massa übernahm nach diesem Rennen die Führung in der Weltmeisterschaft und wurde damit zum ersten Brasilianer seit Ayrton Senna, dem dies gelang. Nachdem Massa beim Großen Preis von Großbritannien außerhalb der Punkteränge ins Ziel kam, verlor er die Führung in der Weltmeisterschaft jedoch wieder an Lewis Hamilton. Nach einem dritten Platz in Deutschland führte Massa den Großen Preis von Ungarn in der Schlussphase an. Drei Runde vor Ende des Rennens fiel er mit einem Motorschaden aus. Die darauf folgenden Rennen in Europa und Belgien gewann er. Nach einem sechsten Platz beim Ferrari-Heimrennen in Italien lag Massa in der Fahrerwertung vor den letzten vier Saisonrennen einen Punkt hinter Hamilton. Beim Großen Preis von Singapur startete Massa von der Pole-Position und führte das Rennen zunächst an. Nach einem absichtlichen ausgelösten Unfall von Nelson Piquet jr. kam es schon früh zu einer Safety-Car-Phase, in der Massa an die Box kam. Dabei fuhr Massa los, als der Tankschlauch noch an seinem Auto hing. Durch diese Panne fiel Massa ans Ende des Feldes zurück und kam außerhalb der Punkteränge ins Ziel. Nach einem siebten Platz in Japan und einem zweiten Platz in China ging Massa mit sieben Punkten Rückstand auf den Führenden Hamilton ins letzte Saisonrennen in Brasilien. Massa gewann das Rennen, wodurch Hamilton zum Titelgewinn mindestens Fünfter werden musste, da Massa bei Punktgleichheit aufgrund der höheren Sieganzahl vorne gelegen hätte. Hamilton verbesserte sich in der vorletzten Kurve auf den fünften Platz und kam auf diesem ins Ziel, sodass er mit einem Punkt Vorsprung auf Massa Weltmeister wurde. Die Fans auf der Tribüne und sein Team hatten zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits den vermeintlichen Weltmeisterschaftsgewinn Massas gefeiert. Intern schlug Massa Räikkönen mit 97 zu 75 Punkten. 2009 2009 blieben Massa und Räikkönen bei Ferrari. Nach gravierenden Reglementsänderungen in diesem Jahr gelang es Ferrari nicht, ein Fahrzeug zu entwickeln, mit dem die Fahrer Chancen auf den Weltmeistertitel hatten. Massa blieb in den ersten vier Rennen ohne Punkte, kam bei den darauf folgenden fünf Rennen jedoch immer unter den ersten sechs ins Ziel. Beim letzten dieser fünf Rennen in Deutschland stand er als Dritter erstmals auf dem Podest. Bei der Qualifikation zum nächsten Grand Prix, dem Großen Preis von Ungarn, verletzte sich Massa schwer, als ihn eine etwa 800 Gramm schwere Metallfeder, die sich von Barrichellos Rennwagen gelöst hatte, bei Tempo 240 km/h in Höhe des Helms traf und er daraufhin kurzzeitig das Bewusstsein verlor. Der Wagen fuhr ungelenkt frontal in einen Reifenstapel, während Massa, der benommen war, laut Telemetriedaten gleichzeitig das Gas- und das Bremspedal betätigt hatte. Massa erlitt bei dem Unfall einen Schnitt an der Stirn, eine Schädelfraktur sowie eine schwere Gehirnerschütterung (Schädel-Hirn-Trauma). Bei einer zweistündigen Operation wurde ihm ein Knochensplitter hinter der Augenhöhle entfernt. Er fiel für den Rest der Saison aus. Zum Zeitpunkt seiner Verletzung lag Massa vor Räikkönen auf dem fünften Platz in der Fahrerwertung. Massa wurde in den folgenden beiden Rennen durch Luca Badoer vertreten und anschließend bis zum Saisonende durch Fisichella ersetzt. Beide Vertretungsfahrer blieben im Ferrari ohne Punkte, während Räikkönen ein Rennen gewann. Beim vorletzten Rennen in Brasilien schwenkte Massa die Zielflagge. In der Gesamtwertung belegte Massa den elften Gesamtrang. 2010 Für die Saison 2010 erhielt Massa mit Alonso einen neuen Teamkollegen bei Ferrari. Beim Saisonauftakt in Bahrain bestritt Massa den ersten Grand Prix nach seinem Unfall und wurde hinter Alonso Zweiter. Beim darauf folgenden Großen Preis von Australien verteidigte Massa seine Position gegenüber seinem Teamkollegen, der direkt hinter ihm ins Ziel kam, und stand als Dritter erneut auf dem Podest. Nach dem dritten Rennen übernahm Massa erstmals seit 2008 wieder die Führung in der Fahrerweltmeisterschaft, musste sie allerdings bereits nach einem weiteren Rennen an Jenson Button abgeben. In den nächsten sieben Rennen kam Massa nur einmal in die Top 5, sodass er in der Fahrerwertung zurückfiel und nach dem Großen Preis von Großbritannien auf dem achten Platz lag, während Alonso Fünfter war. Beim darauf folgenden Großen Preis von Deutschland übernahm Massa zum ersten Mal in der Saison die Führung eines Rennens. Nachdem ihm sein Renningenieur mitgeteilt hatte, dass Alonso, der direkt hinter ihm lag, schneller war, ließ er ihn sehr offensichtlich überholen, indem er vom Gas ging. Am Ende belegte er hinter seinem Teamkollegen den zweiten Platz. Die Rennleitung bewertete das Überholmanöver als verbotene Stallorder und belegte das Team mit einer Geldstrafe von 100.000  US-Dollar. Im restlichen Saisonverlauf stand er als Dritter in Italien und Korea bei zwei weiteren Rennen auf dem Podium. Massa hatte die gesamte Saison Probleme mit den harten Reifen und es gelang ihm speziell in der Qualifikation nur selten, die Reifen optimal zum Arbeiten zu bringen. Er beendete die Saison mit 144 Punkten auf dem sechsten Gesamtrang, während Alonso mit 252 Vizeweltmeister wurde. 2011 2011 startete Massa mit drei Punkteplatzierungen in die Saison. Beim siebten Rennen, dem Großen Preis von Kanada hatte er zwischenzeitlich Chancen auf eine Podest-Platzierung. Nach einem Zwischenfall beim Überrunden, der einen zusätzlichen Stopp erforderlich machte, zeigte er einige Überholmanöver und kam schließlich auf dem sechsten Platz ins Ziel. Massa beendete die Saison mit sechs fünften Plätzen als beste Resultate den sechsten Platz in der Fahrerweltmeisterschaft. Mit 118 zu 257 Punkten unterlag er Alonso, der ein Rennen gewann, deutlich. Massa war 2011 der beste Pilot, der nie auf dem Podium stand. 2012 2012 ging Massa erneut für Ferrari an den Start. Während sein Teamkollege Alonso das zweite Rennen, den Großen Preis von Malaysia, gewann, erreichte Massa das Ziel auf dem 15. Platz. Beim vierten Rennen in Bahrain erzielte Massa mit dem neunten Platz zum ersten Mal in der Saison Punkte. Nachdem Massa nach dem fünften Rennen zwei Punkte hatte, während Alonso im gleichen Zeitraum 61 Punkte erzielt hatte, wurde Massa in einer Pressemitteilung des Teams indirekt aufgefordert einen „anderen Gang einzulegen“. Beim darauf folgenden Rennen in Monaco gelang es Massa durchgängig, in der Spitzengruppe mitzufahren und er wurde mit rund sechs Sekunden Rückstand Sechster. Ab diesem Rennen kam Massa nur bei zwei weiteren Grands Prix nicht in die Top 10. Beim Großen Preis von Großbritannien gelang es ihm, mit einem vierten Platz seine bis dahin beste Saisonplatzierung zu erreichen. Diese wiederholte er beim Großen Preis von Italien. Mit einem zweiten Platz beim Großen Preis von Japan erzielte Massa seine erste Podest-Platzierung der Saison. Eine weitere folgte bei seinem Heimrennen in Brasilien, als er Dritter wurde. Am Saisonende belegte er den siebten Platz in der Fahrerweltmeisterschaft. 2013 2013 bestritt Massa seine achte Formel-1-Saison für Ferrari. Alonso blieb sein Teamkollege. Beim Großen Preis von Australien startete Massa mit einem vierten Platz in die Saison. Vier Rennen später beim Großen Preis von Spanien fuhr Massa als Dritter auf das Podest. Massa beendete die Saison auf dem achten Platz in der Weltmeisterschaft. Mit 112 zu 242 Punkten unterlag er erneut Alonso. Massa verließ Ferrari zum Ende der Saison 2013. Williams (seit 2014) 2014 ging Massa in der Formel 1 an der Seite von Valtteri Bottas für Williams an den Start. Er erhielt einen Zweijahresvertrag, den Williams mit einer Option um ein Jahr verlängern konnte. Bei der Einführung der permanenten Formel-1-Startnummern wählte er die #19 für seine weitere Karriere. Beim Großen Preis von Österreich erzielte Massa seine erste Pole-Position für Williams. Im Rennen wurde er Vierter. Beim Großen Preis von Italien gelang Massa mit Platz drei seine erste Podest-Platzierung für Williams. In Brasilien wurde er ein weiteres Mal Dritter. Beim letzten Saisonrennen in Abu Dhabi gelang Massa mit dem zweiten Platz seine beste Saisonplatzierung. Er beendete die Saison auf dem siebten Gesamtrang. Intern unterlag er Bottas mit 134 zu 186 Punkten. 2015 bildeten Massa und Bottas erneut das Williams-Fahrerduo. Beim Großen Preis von Österreich wurde er Dritter. Beim nächsten Rennen in Großbritannien übernahm Massa die Führung beim Start und führte das Rennen in der Anfangsphase an. Er fiel aber im Rennverlauf auf den vierten Platz zurück. Vor dem Großen Preis von Italien wurde Massa für eine weitere Saison bei Williams bestätigt. In dem Grand Prix erzielte er mit dem dritten Rang die zweite Podiums-Platzierung der Saison. In Singapur fiel Massa zum ersten Mal in der Saison aus. Beim Großen Preis von Russland fuhr Massa vom 15. Startplatz auf Platz vier. Er verbesserte sich auf den sechsten Platz in der Weltmeisterschaft und unterlag Bottas mit 121 zu 136 Punkten. 2016 blieben Massa und Bottas bei Williams. Nach dem 14. Rennen belegte er den zehnten Gesamtrang. Am 1. September 2016 gab Massa sein Karriereende zum Saisonende in der Formel-1-Weltmeisterschaft bekannt. 
G;|Emil Hermann Werner Ackermann, auch bekannt unter den Pseudonymen Rico Gala, Robert Landmann, W.A. Fieldmann oder W.A. Kermann (* 28. Dezember 1892 in Antwerpen, Belgien; † 10. Mai 1982 in Mbabane, Swasiland) war ein deutschsprachiger Schriftsteller, Verleger und zeitweise Miteigentümer der Künstlerkolonie Monte Verità in Ascona/Schweiz.  Werner Ackermann wurde 1892 in Antwerpen als Sohn des deutschen Buchhändlers Rudolf Ackermann und seiner Frau Elli, geb. Koeving geboren. Seine Eltern betrieben eine internationale Buchhandlung am Place Verte in Antwerpen, unweit der Kathedrale. Der Vater Rudolf Ackermann stammte aus Könnern in der preußischen Provinz Sachsen, wo die Familie eine Ziegelei und eine Grube besaß, und war in der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts nach Antwerpen ausgewandert; die Mutter war die Tochter deutscher Emigranten in den USA. Antwerpen hatte sich an der Wende zum 19. Jahrhundert wieder zu einer europäischen Handelsmetropole entwickelt; vor allem niederländische und deutsche Kaufleute (Seehandel, Reederei, Seeversicherung, Fell- und Wollhandel) waren zugewandert. Den deutschen Kaufleuten waren deutsche Handwerker, Hausangestellte, Ladenbesitzer und Gastronomen gefolgt. Um 1910 lebten über 8000 Deutsche in Antwerpen. Werner Ackermann hegte zeitlebens große Sympathien für den Philosophen Max Stirner und propagierte ein kompromissloses weltbürgerliches Denken der Individuen, das den egoistischen und aggressiven Nationalstaat ablehnt. Er selbst bezeichnete sich als großen Glücksmenschen, worunter er nicht das ‚Gutestubenglück‘ mit Geld und gesicherter Position verstand, sondern seinen steten Glauben an sich und seinen steten Sinn. Kindheit und Jugend Werner Ackermann verbrachte seine Kindheit mit seinen beiden Geschwistern, dem älteren Eduard und der jüngeren Hilde, in der elterlichen Wohnung über der Buchhandlung am Place Verte in Antwerpen. Ab 1898 besuchte Werner Ackermann die 1882 gegründete Deutsche Schule in Antwerpen. Die Schule war bilingual (Deutsch und Französisch) und genoss einen sehr guten Ruf. Die Geschwister Ackermann galten als unartig. Werner Ackermann musste die Schule wechseln und war zeitweise auf einem Internat im Deutschen Reich. Ackermann wuchs in einem bildungsbürgerlichen Milieu mit deutschnationaler, lutherischer Prägung auf. Der Vater war der belesene Buchhändler, die Mutter die Geschäftsfrau. Das Verhältnis zu den Eltern war gut. In einem späteren Brief an die Eltern schrieb Werner Ackermann: Ackermann verfasste während der Schulzeit erste Theaterstücke, die er an Max Reinhardt schickte. Reinhardt soll ihn zum weiteren Schreiben ermuntert haben. 1909 entschied sich Werner Ackermann für die deutsche Staatsbürgerschaft, was er später schwer bereute. Erste berufliche Erfahrungen Nach einem kurzen Studium an der privaten Journalisten Hochschule von Richard Wrede in Berlin (1912/13) vermittelten ihm die Eltern eine Anstellung beim Touring Club Suisse in Genf. Während dieser Zeit verfasst er die beiden Stücke ‚Größe‘ und ‚Der große Junge‘. Erster Weltkrieg Werner Ackermann meldete sich nach Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs als Kriegsfreiwilliger auf deutscher Seite und kam als Unteroffizier bei der Feldartillerie an der belgischen und französischen Front zum Einsatz. Die anfängliche Kriegsbegeisterung von Werner Ackermann verwandelte sich schon nach wenigen Monaten über eine Kriegsernüchterung in einen Pazifismus, der für seine weitere politische Entwicklung prägend sein sollte. Im September 1916 wurde er verletzt und landete im Reservelazarett VII in Hannover-Herrenhausen, wo er versuchte seine Genesung so lange wie möglich hinauszuzögern. Studium und Heirat Bereits am 16. November 1917, also noch vor Kriegsende, nahm er als Leutnant d. R. das Studium der Literaturwissenschaft an der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin auf, das er jedoch im Frühjahr 1919 wieder abbrach. Anfang 1920 heiratete er in Berlin Hedwig Emma Ota Boehme (1894–1986), Tochter eines Eisenbahningenieurs aus Hannover. Beide lehnten die Institution Ehe ab, benötigten aber den Trauschein, um an eine Wohnung zu kommen. Im November 1921 wurde die Tochter Sonja geboren. Verleger und Miteigentümer des Monte Verità Nach der vorzeitigen Beendigung des Studiums wurde Werner Ackermann in Berlin Teilhaber der Verlage Ackermann & Pungs sowie Morawe & Scheffelt. Er veröffentlichte u. a. Werke von Hans Bethge, Eugen Georg und Jeremias Gotthelf. Auch zwei Farblithographien von Lou Albert-Lasard, die Albert Einstein darstellen, wurden herausgegeben. Die wirtschaftlichen Umstände des Verlagswesens in der Anfangsphase der Weimarer Republik gestalteten sich jedoch immer schwieriger. Der Zusammenbruch des deutschen Finanzsystems und die Hyperinflation veranlassten Werner Ackermann schließlich im August 1923 die Verlage zu verkaufen und woanders nach einer besseren Zukunft zu suchen. Mit seinen Berliner Freunden, dem Maler Hugo Wilkens und dem Rezitator und Kunstgewerbler Max Bethke, beschloss er, von Henri Oedenkoven die Künstlerkolonie ‚Monte Verità‘ in Ascona zu erwerben. Ein Teil des fehlenden Kapitals wurde von Verwandten seines Schwagers William Werner, der einer reichen Antwerpener Industriellenfamilie entstammte, zugeschossen. Am 1. Februar 1924 wurde der Monte Verità nach größeren Renovierungs- und Umbauarbeiten als Künstlerhotel offiziell eröffnet. Dem Künstlerhotel ‚Monte Verità‘ war kein wirtschaftlicher Erfolg beschieden. Auf Druck der belgischen Geldgeber mussten Wilkens und Ackermann bereits im Herbst 1924 wieder aus der Eigentümergemeinschaft ausscheiden, wenig später wurde die Künstlerkolonie an den ehemaligen Bankier des deutschen Kaisers, Baron Eduard von der Heydt, verkauft. Ackermann und Wilkens blieben jedoch beide mit ihren Familien in Ascona. Werner Ackermann freundete sich mit dem russischen Baron Eduard von Erdberg, dem Biologen und Naturforscher Karl Soffel, dem Schriftsteller Max Picard und dem späteren Marionettentheaterregisseur Jakob Flach an. Werner Ackermann war nun freier Schriftsteller. Neben Artikeln für Schweizer Zeitungen entstanden seit 1925 Beiträge für ‚Die Weltbühne‘, die satirische Zeitschrift ‚Das Stachelschwein‘ von Hans Reimann und ‚Die Annalen‘ von Dr. Walter Muschg. Der Schwerpunkt seiner Arbeit lag allerdings bei seinen Theaterstücken. Er schrieb in dieser Zeit u. a. die Stücke ‚Die Brücke‘, 'Fünf Akte Lotterie' und ‚Flucht nach Shanghai‘. Gelegentlich trat er mit dem deutschnationalen Dichter Werner von der Schulenburgund dem Dadaisten und Surrealisten Hans Arp bei Lyrik-Lesungen im Haus seines Schwagers William Werner auf. Er sah sich selbst als Kopfarbeiter und verlangte in einer polemischen Replik auf einen Artikel in der Zeitschrift der KPD ‚Die Front‘, dass der Literat, der frei vom bürgerlichen Dünkel ist, wohl verlangen kann, dass ihm der Handarbeiter ohne Dünkel gegenübertritt. Ackermann immer wieder interessierendes Thema war der Kolonialismus. In einem Essay nahm Ackermann 1927 den kritischen Reisebericht André Gides über den Kongo zum Anlass, sich mit den wieder auflebenden Kolonialinteressen in der Weimarer Republik auseinanderzusetzen, ein Interesse, das bis ins sozialistische Milieu hineinreichte. Für Ackermann war, im Unterschied zu Gide, der Kolonialismus zwangsläufig durch unbegrenzte Gewaltherrschaft charakterisiert und damit verbrecherisch. Daran sollte man sich aus seiner Sicht als Bürger nicht mitschuldig machen. Frühzeitig kritisierte er den Rassismus der weißen Siedler in Südafrika und sah den Befreiungskampf der Schwarzen bereits am Horizont heraufziehen, allerdings mit der Hoffnung, dass sich der Klassenkampf dem Rassenkampf hinzugesellen würde. Auch an der Debatte um die Paneuropa-Idee von Graf Richard Nikolaus Coudenhove-Kalergi beteiligte sich Werner Ackermann 1926 und 1930. Zu den Mitgliedern der Pan-Europa Union gehörten u. a. Franz Werfel, Thomas Mann und Albert Einstein. Coudenhove und andere, darunter auch der Herausgeber der Weltbühne Carl von Ossietzky, sahen in einem geeinten Europa einen Ausweg aus der heraufziehenden Kriegsgefahr. Ackermann sah in der Paneuropa- Idee eine Gefahr, weil sie „ohne den ständigen Ausblick auf Weltstaat, proletarische Internationale oder herrschaftslose Gesellschaft ein Spielball zwischen unvereinbaren Interessen – also eine Bombe“ (bleiben müsse). Für Ossietzky eine Verkennung der damaligen Etappe europäischer Entwicklung. Die Vorstellung von der ‚Staatenlosigkeit‘ fand sich partiell wieder in den Grundsätzen der Cosmopolitischen Union, die er 1928 zusammen mit Kurt Zube und Ulrich von Beckerath gründete und deren Provisorisches Sekretariat in Ascona eingerichtet wurde. Die Cosmopolitische Union wurde mit dem Machtantritt Hitlers 1933 wieder aufgelöst, viele ihrer Mitglieder gingen in die innere oder äußere Emigration. Trotzdem blieb Ackermann der Idee vom Weltstaat treu und wurde nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg Mitglied in Joe Heydeckers Weltstaatliga. Erste Erfolge Nach seiner Rückkehr nach Berlin Ende 1928 bemühte sich Werner Ackermann verstärkt um die Aufführung seiner Theaterstücke. Im Februar 1930 wurde sein Stück ‚Flucht nach Shanghai‘ von Fritz Jessner am Schauspielhaus Königsberg uraufgeführt. Eine bereits 1929 geplante Aufführung am Staatlichen Schauspiel zu Berlin unter der Regie von Leopold Jessner kam nicht mehr zustande, nachdem Jessner die Generalintendanz auf politischen Druck hatte aufgeben müssen. Herbert Ihering, einer der führenden Theaterkritiker der Weimarer Zeit, sah darin eine verpasste Gelegenheit für das Berliner Theater und schrieb: Am 26. Oktober 1930 kam es noch zu einer einmaligen Aufführung des Stücks in einer Nachtvorstellung des Lessingtheaters in Berlin unter der Regie des jungen Max Ophüls. 1930 wurde das Theaterstück Kleists Tod, das Werner Ackermann zusammen mit dem Juden und Kommunisten Siegfried Lönnerstädter geschrieben hatte, als Hörspiel im Schweizer Radio uraufgeführt. Mit Lönnerstädter verfasste er auch die Funkgroteske Dr. Eisenbart. Es folgte im Januar 1931 die Uraufführung von Fünf Akte Lotterie am Frankfurter Künstler-Theater. Daneben führte Werner Ackermann Auftragsarbeiten durch. Der Käufer des Monte Verità, Baron Eduard von der Heydt, beauftragte ihn ein Buch über die Geschichte der Künstlerkolonie zu schreiben, das 1930 im Adalbert Schultz Verlag, Berlin erschien und bis heute immer wieder aufgelegt wurde. Der pazifistische Druckereibesitzer und Verleger Paul Riechert finanzierte Werner Ackermann 1931 einen halbjährigen Aufenthalt in St. Tropez, um über den Kampf des italienischen Sozialisten Matteotti gegen Mussolini zu recherchieren. Seit 1927 erschien bei Riechert die ‚Deutsche Zukunft‘, ein Antikriegsblatt, und 1929 das eigenständige Beiblatt „Die Friedensfront“ unter der Leitung von Dr. Arnold Kalisch als offizielles Organ der „Bund der Kriegsdienstgegner“. Zu deren Autoren gehörte auch Marcel van Diest, den Werner Ackermann in Brüssel wiedertreffen sollte. Auf der Basis der Recherchen schrieb Werner Ackermann den Roman ‚Wehe dem Sieger‘ und das gleichnamige Theaterstück. Die erste Auflage des Romans wurde kurz vor Auslieferung 1932 durch die SA, die den Riechert-Verlag stürmte und demolierte, fast vollständig vernichtet. Europäisches Exil Werner Ackermann machte sich keine Illusionen über den heraufziehenden Nationalsozialismus. Im Herbst 1932 verließ er Berlin und zog mit Familie zu seinen Eltern in den Kunstkaten von Ahrenshoop, den die Eltern 1919 erworben hatten. 1933 verließ er schließlich Deutschland aus Gesinnungsgründen, wie er später sagte. Es folgten zwölf unruhige Jahre. Verzweifelt versuchte er sich 1933 zunächst in Zürich bei der Schwester, danach in Istanbul und auf Ibiza eine neue Existenz aufzubauen. Alle Projekte scheiterten. Schließlich kehrte er mit Frau und Kind an seinen Geburtsort Antwerpen zurück, wo er als deutscher Flüchtling eine aufenthaltsrechtlich und wirtschaftlich prekäre Existenz führte. Werner Ackermann hielt sich mit Übersetzungen einzelner Werke von Stijn Streuvels, Elisabeth Zanke und Antoon Coolen über Wasser. Kurzzeitig arbeitete er bei Klaus Manns Exil-Zeitschrift ‚Die Sammlung‘ mit. Es entstanden die Stücke ‚Langusten für das Volk‘, ‚Der Minnesänger‘, ‚Dolores und Juan‘ und ‚Das Mädchen aus Prag‘. Einzelne Stücke wurden als Hörspiele bei Radio Suisse und bei Radio Paris gesendet. In der Wehrmacht Zu Beginn des deutschen Überfalls auf Belgien wurde Werner Ackermann als feindlicher Ausländer von den belgischen Behörden am Rande der Pyrenäen in Südfrankreich interniert. Während der Internierung stellte er einen Aufnahmeantrag bei der Fremdenlegion, der aber abgelehnt wurde. Nach der Besetzung Belgiens wurden die Internierten, darunter auch Ackermann, von der deutschen Militärverwaltung repatriiert. Werner Ackermann begann danach in Brüssel als Übersetzer für die Abwehrstelle (Ast) Brüssel unter Dr. Karl Krazer zu arbeiten. Krazer war Monarchist und Hitlergegner und hielt eine schützende Hand über Ackermann, als diesem von der NSDAP Ortsgruppe Antwerpen u. a. wegen seines 1934 gestellten Antrags auf eine belgische 'carte d'identité' politische Unzuverlässigkeit vorgeworfen wurde. Mehrere danach folgende Verhöre durch den Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsführers SS (SD) blieben folgenlos. Im August 1942 wurde Werner Ackermann schließlich zum aktiven Wehrdienst der Wehrmacht einberufen und bei der Marinespionage in Antwerpen eingesetzt. Nach der Auflösung der Ast Brüssel im Herbst 1943 wurde er an die Abwehrstelle Köln überstellt und geriet im April 1945 in Bad Wildungen in amerikanische Kriegsgefangenschaft. Nachkriegsjahre in der Bundesrepublik Nach der Entlassung aus der Kriegsgefangenschaft im August 1946 siedelte sich Werner Ackermann in Weinheim an der Bergstraße an. Er hoffte darauf, in einem vom Nationalsozialismus befreiten Deutschland an die erfolgreichen späten 1920er und frühen 1930er Jahre anknüpfen zu können. In der Tat war der Auftakt durchaus vielversprechend. Mehrere seiner Hörspiele kamen in den folgenden Jahren bei den Radiosendern Saarbrücken, Stuttgart, Wien und Halle zur Aufführung. Die Theaterstücke ‚Kinder aus Spanien‘ und ‚Langusten für das Volk‘ wurden uraufgeführt, und sein Matteotti-Roman wurde 1947 in der Bundesrepublik und 1950 in der DDR verlegt. Ackermann freundete sich mit dem Schauspieler und Regisseur Herbert G. Doberauer, dem Maler Willi Baumeister und dem Galeristen Egon Günther an. Günther stellte als einer der Ersten nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg Beckmann, Kirchner, Feininger, Dix, Klee und andere von den Nationalsozialisten verfemte Maler wieder aus. Er zeigte auch bereits afrikanische Kunst, die damals noch ‚Negerplastik‘ hieß. Der heraufziehende Kalte Krieg führte jedoch alsbald zu Schwierigkeiten. In der Bundesrepublik erlahmte im Zuge der Restauration das Interesse an dem kapitalismuskritischen Autor der Weimarer Republik, und für die DDR war Ackermann im Zuge der Stalinisierung ideologisch fragwürdig geworden. So wurde sein Roman ‚Ein Toter besiegt Mussolini‘ über den Sozialistenführer Matteotti nach der Gründung der SED von den DDR-Behörden kurz nach Drucklegung beschlagnahmt und danach nicht wieder aufgelegt. Zweites Exil in Südafrika und Tod Werner Ackermann war von Deutschland mehr und mehr beruflich und politisch enttäuscht und entschloss sich 1951 auf Einladung seines alten Freundes Hugo Wilkens nach Südafrika auszuwandern. Wilkens war mit seiner zukünftigen jüdischen Frau bereits 1936 nach Südafrika emigriert. Abgeschnitten von den deutschen Theatern und dem deutschen Verlagswesen einerseits und vorwiegend im Kontakt mit anderen deutschen Emigranten in Südafrika (insbesondere mit dem Journalisten Alfred Futran und dem Galeristen Egon Günther) blieb Werner Ackermann jedoch isoliert und weitgehend auf sich selbst zurückgeworfen. In einem Brief an Wilhelm Fraenger schrieb er 1955: Es entstanden noch Kurzgeschichten und einige Theaterstücke, bis auf das Kriminalstück ‚Mord ohne Spuren‘ kamen letztere aber nicht mehr zur Aufführung. Werner Ackermann lebte überwiegend von kleineren und größeren Zeitungsartikeln, die sich großenteils mit Afrika befassten. Politisch wollte er sich unter dem Apartheid-Regime in Südafrika, das er verabscheute, nicht mehr betätigen, denn: Werner Ackermann verstarb im Mai 1982 bei seiner Tochter in Mbabane/Swasiland. |
G;|Leo Birinski (* vielleicht 8. Juni 1884 in Lysjanka, Russisches Kaiserreich, heute Oblast Tscherkassy, Ukraine; † 23. Oktober 1951 in der Bronx, New York City, New York) war ein Dramatiker, Drehbuchautor und Filmregisseur jüdischer Herkunft. Er war in Österreich, Deutschland und in den Vereinigten Staaten tätig. Es gibt nur minimale Angaben zu Birinski in Enzyklopädien oder Wörterbüchern und kaum biographische Informationen. Die wenigen sind entweder verschwommen oder sogar verkehrt. Man kann fast mit Sicherheit festhalten, dass er die Entstehung verschiedener Täuschungen im gewissen Maße unterstützte.  Geburtsdatum und Geburtsort Zu Geburtsdatum und Ort gibt es etwa acht Versionen. Laut deutschen und österreichischen Quellen und der Großen Jüdischen National-Biographie wurde Birinski in Bukowina geboren – entweder direkt in der Hauptstadt Czernowitz oder im Städtchen Storoschynez, und zwar 1880 oder 1884. Laut tschechischer Enzyklopädien wurde er 1885 in Kiew in der Ukraine geboren. Laut Billy H. Doyles The Ultimate Directory of Film Technicians… war es 1882 irgendwo im Russland. Eine eindeutige Antwort bieten nicht mal Birinskis zeitgenössische persönliche Dokumente. In Wiener Meldezetteln wurden zuerst der Juli 1884 als Geburtsdatum und abwechselnd Städtchen Borszczów oder Skała in Galizien als Geburtsort angeführt. Im Dezember 1914 änderte Birinski plötzlich seine Identität und führte (bis zur endgültigen Abreise aus Wien) den 8. Juni 1884 als Geburtsdatum und Lysjanka im Russland (190 km südlich von Kiew, heutige Ukraine) als Geburtsort an. Bei seiner Ankunft in den USA im September 1927 wies er sich in der Einwanderungsbehörde mit einem Reisepass Nicaraguas aus und führte als Geburtsort die Hafenstadt Bluefields in Nicaragua an. Welche dieser Angaben richtig ist, kann man heute mit Sicherheit nicht bestimmen, einige kann man jedoch ausschließen. Die jüdischen Personenverzeichnisse von Czernowitz und Borszczów blieben bis heute erhalten und bestreiten diese Städte als Birinskis Geburtsort. Eine nicaraguanische Identität klingt exotisch, jedoch nicht glaubwürdig – Birinski fuhr aus Wien nach Berlin im Jahre 1921 als ukrainischer Bürger (das kann man durch Meldezettel belegen). Familiäre Umstände sprechen für den Geburtsort Lysjanka. Sein Vater Hermann (Hersch) Gottesmann stammte aus Borszczów und heiratete jedoch 1877 in Potschapinzy (10 km von Lysjanka) Czarna Berinska (oder Birinska) aus Lysjanka. Dort wurde auch 1889 Leos jüngerer Bruder Mordko geboren. Die Personenverzeichnisse von Lysjanka wurden leider zerstört; deshalb bleibt diese Hypothese für immer unbestätigt. Was das Geburtsdatum angeht, muss man sich auf das von ihm im Zusammenhang mit Lysjanka angeführte Datum verlassen – 8. Juni 1884. Die Gründe, warum er seine Identität im Dezember 1914 änderte, kann man nur vermuten. Für das Leben in Österreich-Ungarn war es sicherlich einfacher, als österreichischer Bürger, aus Galizien stammend, aufzutreten – offenbar gelang es ihm, österreichische Behörden davon zu überzeugen, vielleicht dank der Provenienz seines Vaters Hermann. Nach dem Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges konnte er sich bedroht fühlen, in die Armee berufen zu werden und deshalb war es günstiger, seine Provenienz aus Lysjanka zu gestehen – wodurch er zum Bürger eines Feindstaats mit der Genehmigung zum Daueraufenthalt in Wien geworden ist. Es ist jedoch nur eine Hypothese. Wien Über Birinskis frühe Lebensphase ist nur wenig bekannt. Hermann Gottesmanns Familie lebte wohl bis in die 1890er Jahre in der Ukraine und zog kurz vor der Jahrhundertwende nach Czernowitz (am 1. Januar 1900 wurde dort Leos Schwester Anna geboren). Es gibt zwei Zeitangaben, wann Birinski in Wien ankam. Nach zeitgenössischen tschechischen Quellen war es im Jahre 1901, laut Meldezettel seines Bruders Mordko zog die Familie im Juli 1904 aus Czernowitz nach Wien um. In Wien arbeitete er als Handelsgehilfe im Buchhandel, bald fand er jedoch den Weg in Künstlerkreise und befreundete sich mit den Schauspielern Hugo Thimig und Josef Kainz, die seinen Einstieg in eine künstlerische Karriere unterstützten. Er fing an zu übersetzen und später auch eigene Bühnenstücke zu schreiben. Er arbeitete für Kainz in dessen letzter Lebensphase als sein persönlicher Sekretär und pflegte ihn auch während seiner schweren Krankheit bis zum Tode im September 1910. Laut Meldezetteln besuchte Birinski schon vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg bisweilen Berlin und München, wo er wohl weitere Kontakte zu Künstlern knüpfte. In Wien schrieb Birinski drei Theaterstücke. Die Tragödie Der Moloch erlebte im Januar 1910 in Wien ihre Premiere und wurde dreimal herausgegeben. Bald danach wurde sie auch in Deutschland aufgeführt und in mehrere Sprachen übersetzt. Das Drama Raskolnikoff nach Dostojewski (in einigen Quellen als Erstlingswerk bezeichnet) entstand ebenfalls 1910, wurde jedoch erst 1912 herausgegeben und 1913 in Gera uraufgeführt. Es wurde damals nur ins Kroatische und Slowenische übersetzt. Im Jahre 2007 wurde es auch auf Tschechisch aufgeführt. Das erfolgreichste Stück dieser Periode war der Narrentanz. Diese Komödie (laut Birinski Tragikomödie) erlebte am 28. September 1912 in zehn Städten gleichzeitig die Uraufführung und wurde bald herausgegeben. Es folgten viele weiteren Aufführungen auf Deutsch (u.a. im November 1912 am Irving Place German Theatre in New York City) und eine Reihe von Übersetzungen. Im März 1920 erschien in der Wiener Presse eine Nachricht über Birinskis Selbstmord, die sich schnell auch im Ausland verbreitete. Bald erwies sich dies als Verwechslung mit einem jüngeren Verwandten aus Galizien – Leon Gottesmann. Zwar veröffentlichten die Zeitungen einen Widerruf, doch für viele Lexika endet hier das Leben Birinskis. Dadurch spaltete sich seine Person in zwei unterschiedliche enzyklopädische Lemmata – der Dramatiker Birinski „starb“ 1920, der Filmmacher Birinski tauchte in den 1920er Jahren „aus einem unbekannten Ort“ auf. Der echte Birinski verließ 1921 endgültig Wien und übersiedelte nach Berlin. Berlin Sein Leben in Berlin ist schwieriger zusammenzustellen als sein Wiener Aufenthalt – Meldezettel aus dieser Zeit sind nicht erhalten. Die einzige schriftliche Spur ist der Eintrag im Meldebuch eines kleinen Hotels in Kloster auf der Insel Hiddensee, doch nicht einmal das Jahr steht fest. Aus anderen Dokumenten ergibt sich, dass Birinski in Deutschland Felicia Aschkenas (geb. 1902 in Warschau) heiratete, eine Pianistin jüdischer Abstammung. In Deutschland widmete sich Birinski vor allem der Filmarbeit. Er verfasste (teilweise mit Co-Autoren) Drehbücher für verschiedene Produzenten und Regisseure, zumeist nach Unterhaltungsstoffen mit der Tendenz zum Trivialen. Sein erstes nachgewiesenes Werk war das Drehbuch zum Joe Mays „Gesellschaftsfilm“ Tragödie der Liebe (1923) mit Emil Jannings, Mia May und Marlene Dietrich in einer kleinen Rolle (laut einigen Quellen ging es um ihren ersten aufgeführten Film). Gleich im folgenden Jahr beteiligte er sich am bedeutenden Film Das Wachsfigurenkabinett (1924, Regisseur: Paul Leni und Leo Birinski). Birinskis Anteil an der Filmregie ist fragwürdig, wie schon ein zeitgenössischer Rezensent bemerkte: „Auf dem Programm steht zu lesen: Regie Paul Leni, Spielleitung Leo Birinski. Mit Verlaub: Ich habe bisher immer Regie für Spielleitung, Spielleitung für Regie und beide für ein und dasselbe gehalten. Also, wie ist das? (...) Sagen wir es so: Herr Lenibirinski zusammen mit Herrn Birinskileni (Ersterer Regisseurspielleiter, letzterer Spielleiterregisseur) haben brillant konzipiert, golden eingestellt, aber nur silbern ziseliert...“ Man kann Birinskis Bezeichnung als Filmregisseur mit den Worten vom Filmhistoriker Hans-Michael Bock erklären, dass „...Leni, der ja zumeist das Schwergewicht auf die optische Bildgestaltung gelegt hat, hat offenbar gerne theatererfahrene Partner für die Schauspielerführung hinzugezogen.“ Weitere Aufgaben von Birinski bei diesem Film kommentiert er folgendermaßen: „Aus dem Zusammenhang mit seiner Herkunft (...) vermute ich, daß er beim Wachsfigurenkabinett als Berater für die Russen-Episode und als Vertrauensmann für die russischen Finanziers (reiche Emigranten) des Films fungiert hat.“ In einigen Quellen wird noch sein Anteil am Drehbuch einer russischen Episode (Iwan der Schreckliche) erwähnt. In den nächsten drei Jahren wurden in Deutschland nach Birinskis Drehbüchern mehrere Filme pro Jahr gedreht. In Varieté (1925, Regisseur: E. A. Dupont) soll er – wenigstens laut der Datenbank von British Film Institute – eine kleine Rolle gespielt haben. Als Beispiel für alle anderen nennen wir Drehbücher zu den Filmen von Gennaro Righelli Der Bastard (1925) und Der Meister der Welt (1927) oder zum Robert Wienes Film Die Geliebte (1927). Er verarbeitete das Thema der berühmten Spionin für den Film Mata Hari, die rote Tänzerin (1927, Regisseur: Friedrich Feher), das er später in den USA wiederaufnahm. Als Drehbuchautor sollte er an der ersten Romanverfilmung Winnetou von Karl May teilnehmen. Den Film sollte Gennaro Righelli drehen und die Titelrolle sollte Wilhelm Dieterle darstellen – das Projekt kam jedoch nicht zustande. Nach der Korrespondenz zwischen Birinski und Carl Meinhard hat Birinski vor dem Jahre 1927 das Schauspiel Der heilige Teufel (Rasputin) geschrieben. Sein Text im Deutschen wurde nicht gefunden, aber die spätere Version im Englischen existiert in den USA. Amerika Bald nach der Premiere von Mata Hari, die rote Tänzerin ging Birinski in die USA. Laut der Einwanderungsbehörde reiste er am 16. September 1927 auf der Berengaria der Cunard Line von Cherbourg nach New York City Ellis Island ein. Er wies sich mit einem nicaraguanischen Reisepass aus. Offiziell kam er, um seinen Bekannten Simon Sutta (Händler mit Pelzwerk aus Moskau, der in Manhattan lebte) zu besuchen. Sein für sechs Monate bestimmter Aufenthalt verlängerte sich bis zu seinem Tod, also um mehr als 24 Jahre. Seine Ehefrau Felicia – in Begleitung ihrer Mutter – kam am 28. Oktober 1929 auch in Ellis Island an. Ebenso mit einem nicaraguanischen Reisepass und mit dem Ziel, Simon Sutta zu besuchen. Und das ist fast alles, was an Dokumenten über Birinskis Aufenthalt in den USA belegt ist. Laut der Einwanderungslisten verließ er den amerikanischen Kontinent nur einmal, als er 1936 für etwa eine Woche nach Hawaii ausreiste. Bei der Rückkehr führte er an, dass er geschieden ist, wechselte die jüdische Nationalität zur russischen und blieb lediglich der nicaraguanischen Staatsbürgerschaft treu. Von derselben Quelle kennen wir seinen Dauerwohnsitz: Hollywood, 3110 Hollyridge Drive. Es gibt keine wesentlichen Angaben oder Dokumente zu seinem Leben, nicht mal in der Bibliothek der Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, obwohl „he worked on some major films“. Birinskis erstes amerikanisches Werk war vermutlich entweder das Drehbuch zum Film Love and the Devil (Premiere am 24. März 1929, Regisseur: Alexander Korda) oder Regie des Films Das Große Glück mit Rudolph Schildkraut und Louise Dresser – die deutsche Version des Films A Ship Comes In von William K. Howard (1928). Zwei andere Projekte, an denen er sich beteiligte, wurden nicht realisiert. Im Nachlass von Gloria Swanson findet man verschiedene Drehbuchversionen zu Queen Kelly, von Erich von Stroheim begonnen, aber nie vollendet. Eine dieser Versionen wurde zwischen März und April 1929 von Birinski verfasst. Sein Drehbuch entstand auf Deutsch und wurde von Elzie von Koczian ins Englische übersetzt. Das zweite nicht realisierte Projekt sollte der Film nach „Revolutionsstory“ The Bargain in the Kremlin sein, dessen Drehbuch Birinski für Paul Leni schreiben sollte. Nach der mit Verlegenheit empfangenen Olympia (1930, Regisseur: Jacques Feyder, deutsche Version des Films His Glorious Night von Lionel Barrymore) folgten einige erfolgreiche und sog. „major“ Filme. Birinski begann die Serie mit einer zweiten Bearbeitung der Spionen-Thematik in Mata Hari (1931, Regisseur: George Fitzmaurice) mit Greta Garbo in der Titelrolle. Er setzte weiter mit Drehbüchern für die Filme von Rouben Mamoulian The Song of Songs (1933) mit Marlene Dietrich und The Gay Desperado (1936) fort. Inzwischen schrieb er Entwürfe oder Drehbücher für einige „kleinere“ Filme und probierte noch einmal die Arbeit eines Regisseurs an der Filmromanze Flirtation (1934) aus. Ende des Jahres 1936 teilte die Presse mit, dass die Motion Picture Association of America nach Hays Code die Arbeit am Film I Gave My Wife to the King über die Affäre des ehemaligen britischen Königs Edward VIII und der Frau Wallis Simpson im Interesse der guten Beziehungen mit Großbritannien eingestellt wird. Das Thema schlug gerade Birinski vor. Die letzten Filme, an denen Birinskis Anteil als Autor sicher ist, waren Full Confession (1939, Regisseur: John Farrow) und The Lady Has Plans (1942, Regisseur: Sidney Lanfield) mit Paulette Goddard. Die zwei Birinskis Filme dienten auch als Vorlage für Hörspiele, die im Rahmen des Projekts The Lux Radio Theatre das CBS-Netz sendete. Am 20. Dezember 1937 war das The Song of Songs mit Marlene Dietrich und Douglas Fairbanks junior und am 26. April 1943 The Lady Has Plans mit Rita Hayworth und William Powell. Die Sendungsaufnahmen wurden bis heute in einer Privatsammlung überliefert. Birinski nahm auch das Schreiben fürs Theater in den USA wieder auf. Im Jahre 1935 wurde das Drama Nowhere Bound über die aus den USA deportierten Menschen am Broadway inszeniert und 1944 folgte das Stück The Day Will Come, das in der Schlüsselsituation die Begegnung Adolf Hitlers mit Ahasveros in einem verlassenen russischen Dorf behandelt. Außerdem wurde im Nachlass von Herman Bernstein (er starb 1935) Birinskis Maschinenschrift des Theaterstückes The Holy Devil (Rasputin) in der englischen Version gefunden, das wahrscheinlich bisher weder publiziert noch aufgeführt worden ist. Es wartet noch auf seine Weltpremiere. Lebensherbst Die letzten sieben Jahre von Birinskis Leben sind wieder vernebelt. Laut der überlieferten Todesurkunde starb Leo Birinski am 23. Oktober 1951 in dem derzeitigen Armenkrankenhaus Lincoln Hospital in Bronx, New York City. Die Todesurkunde beinhaltet fast keine Angaben über den Verstorbenen – nur die Information, dass er 50 (!!!) Jahre alt war. So besiegelte auch das letzte amtliche persönliche Dokument das Rätsel oder den Irrtum, völlig im Sinne seines ganzen Lebens. Oder ging es etwa um die letzte irreführende Botschaft dieses eigenartigen Menschen für die Geschichtsschreibung? Man möchte es fast glauben. Jedenfalls sieht es so aus, dass Leo Birinski in der Not und vermutlich ganz einsam (ohne Verwandte und Erbfolger) starb. Er wurde in einem Massengrab auf dem Stadtfriedhof Potter´s Field auf Hart Island in Bronx begraben (plot 45, section 2, no. 14). Paul Frank hat im Nekrolog geschrieben: „...Birinski ist, 69 (!!!) Jahre alt, einem Gehirnschlag erlegen. (...) Seine letzten, schweren, von Krankheit und Not verdüsterten Jahre trug er mit bewundernswerter Heiterkeit...“ Dieser Nekrolog diente als Quelle für Billy H. Doyles The Ultimate Directory of Film Technicians…. Im Jahre 2009 gelang es, Birinskis Verwandte in Israel und in den USA zu finden. |
G;Robin Szolkowy [ʃɔlˈkoːviː] (* 14. Juli 1979 in Greifswald) ist ein ehemaliger deutscher Eiskunstläufer im Paarlauf und jetziger Trainer und Sportfunktionär. Mit seiner Eiskunstlaufpartnerin Aljona Savchenko wurde er fünfmal Welt- und viermal Europameister.  Robin Szolkowy wurde in Greifswald geboren. Seine Mutter, eine Krankenschwester, traf seinen Vater, einen tansanischen Medizinstudenten, als dieser in Greifswald studierte. Obwohl Szolkowy seinen Vater von Bildern her kannte, kam es bis zum März 2008 zu keinem Treffen. Als Szolkowy vier Jahre alt war, zog seine Mutter mit ihm nach Erfurt, wo er mit dem Eiskunstlaufen bei Ilona Schindler begann. Zunächst war er wie seine Trainingskollegen Silvio Smalun und Stefan Lindemann Einzelläufer, wechselte mit 16 Jahren aber zum Paarlauf.  Szolkowys erste Partnerin war Johanna Otto. Ab 1997 startete er mit Claudia Rauschenbach, der Tochter von Anett Pötzsch, und wurde mit ihr 2001 deutscher Paarlaufmeister. Das Paar trainierte bei Monika Scheibe in Chemnitz und trat für den Chemnitzer Eislauf-Club an. Als Rauschenbach ihre Karriere beendete, blieb Szolkowy anderthalb Jahre ohne Partnerin und hielt sich mit Synchroneiskunstlauf bei der Chemnitzer Formation Skating Mystery fit, bis ihm Ingo Steuer empfahl, es mit der Juniorenweltmeisterin im Paarlauf von 2000, der Ukrainerin Aljona Savchenko, zu probieren. Ihr Probetraining im Mai 2003 in Chemnitz verlief erfolgreich. Drei Monate später zog Savchenko nach Deutschland und das Eiskunstlaufpaar trainierte nun unter Ingo Steuer. Savchenko und Szolkowy gewannen 2004 auf Anhieb die Deutsche Meisterschaft. Saison 2004/2005 Beim Cup of Russia hatten Savchenko und Szolkowy im November 2004 in Moskau ihr Grand-Prix-Debüt und beendeten es auf dem Bronzerang. Im Jahr 2005 hatten die amtierenden deutschen Paarlaufmeister dann ihr gemeinsames Debüt bei Welt- und Europameisterschaften, das sie als Sechste, bzw. Vierte abschlossen. Saison 2005/2006 Im Oktober 2005 gewannen sie mit Skate Canada ihren ersten Grand-Prix-Wettbewerb und qualifizierten sich damit für ihr erstes Grand-Prix-Finale, das sie mit dem Gewinn der Bronzemedaille abschlossen. Ihre erste Medaille bei einer bedeutenden internationalen Meisterschaft folgte im Januar 2006. Sie wurden in Lyon Vize-Europameister hinter den Russen Tatjana Totmjanina und Maxim Marinin. Aljona Savchenko hatte am 29. Dezember 2005 die deutsche Staatsbürgerschaft bekommen und somit konnte das Eiskunstlaufpaar nun an seinen ersten gemeinsamen Olympischen Spielen teilnehmen. Die Teilnahme wurde jedoch wegen der Stasi-Vorwürfe gegen ihren Trainer Ingo Steuer erheblich erschwert. Steuer war vom olympischen Team ausgeschlossen worden und musste sich die Teilnahme gerichtlich erstreiten. Savchenko und Szolkowy beendeten ihr Olympiadebüt in Turin trotz aller Querelen auf dem sechsten Platz. Dieses Ergebnis wiederholten sie bei der nachfolgenden Weltmeisterschaft. Das Innenministerium übte wegen der Stasi-Vergangenheit Steuers weiterhin Druck auf den deutschen Eislaufverband aus. Dies führte dazu, dass Steuer keine Akkreditierung für die bevorstehenden Turniere bekommen sollte, die Justiz gab Steuer aber Recht. Dennoch kostete die weitere Zusammenarbeit mit Steuer Robin Szolkowy seine Anstellung bei der Bundeswehr und die finanzielle Unterstützung. Dies konnte durch private Sponsoren und Fans ausgeglichen werden, sodass das Paar weitermachen konnte. Saison 2006/2007 Sportlich unbeeindruckt gewannen Savchenko und Szolkowy im November 2006 beim Cup of Russia und qualifizierten sich erneut für das Grand-Prix-Finale, bei dem sie die Silbermedaille errangen. Am 24. Januar 2007 wurden sie in Warschau Europameister. Dabei distanzierten sie die russischen Silbermedaillengewinner Maria Petrowa und Alexei Tichonow um fast 20 Punkte. Es war der erste Europameisterschaftstitel für ein deutsches Paar, seit 1995 ihr Trainer Ingo Steuer mit Partnerin Mandy Wötzel gewonnen hatte. Bei der Weltmeisterschaft in Tokio errangen sie mit Bronze hinter den beiden chinesischen Paaren Shen Xue und Zhao Hongbo sowie Pang Qing und Tong Jian ihre erste Weltmeisterschaftsmedaille. Es war die erste Medaille eines deutschen Paares bei einer Weltmeisterschaft seit der Bronzemedaille von Peggy Schwarz und Mirko Müller 1998. Saison 2007/2008 Die Saison 2007/08 wurde die bisher erfolgreichste Saison des Eiskunstlaufpaares. Es gewann bei Skate Canada und der NHK Trophy, qualifizierte sich somit für das Grand-Prix-Finale und gewann dieses zum ersten Mal. Sie waren damit das einzige deutsche Paar nach Mandy Wötzel und Ingo Steuer, das das Grand-Prix-Finale gewinnen konnte. Bei den Deutschen Meisterschaften am 6. Januar 2008 durchbrachen Savchenko und Szolkowy mit 214,67 Punkten erstmals die 200-Punkte-Marke. Dies hätte Weltrekord bedeutet, doch gehen nationale Meisterschaften nicht in die Wertung der Internationalen Eislaufunion ein. Im Januar 2008 verteidigten sie bei der Europameisterschaft in Zagreb ihren Titel und übertrafen nun auch offiziell die 200-Punkte-Marke. Sie hatten auf die zweitplatzierten Russen Marija Muchortowa und Maxim Trankow fast 33 Punkte Vorsprung. Im März 2008 wurden Aljona Savchenko und Robin Szolkowy in Göteborg zum ersten Mal Weltmeister. Sie verwiesen die Chinesen Zhang Dan und Zhang Hao, die nach dem Kurzprogramm noch in Führung gelegen hatten, auf den zweiten Platz. Es war der erste Weltmeisterschaftstitel für ein deutsches Paar seit Mandy Wötzel und Ingo Steuer 1997 in Lausanne. Saison 2008/2009 Die Saison 2008/09 begann mit Siegen bei Skate America und der Trophée Eric Bompard. Beim Grand-Prix-Finale reichte es allerdings nur zur Bronzemedaille. Nachdem Savchenko und Szolkowy zum sechstenmal in Folge deutsche Paarlaufmeister geworden waren, gewannen sie im Januar 2009 in Helsinki zum dritten Mal in Folge die Europameisterschaft. Zwei Monate später in Los Angeles gelang beiden auch der erneute Gewinn der Goldmedaille bei der Weltmeisterschaft. Sie gewannen sowohl das Kurzprogramm als auch die Kür und lagen mit persönlicher Bestleistung am Ende fast 17 Punkte vor den Chinesen Zhang/Zhang. Damit waren Savchenko und Szolkowy das erste deutsche Paar seit Marika Kilius und Hans-Jürgen Bäumler (1963 und 1964), das seinen WM-Titel erfolgreich verteidigte. Saison 2009/2010 Die Saison 2009/10 wurde zur problematischsten ihrer Karriere. Nachdem sie bei der Trophée Eric Bompard das Kurzprogramm gewonnen hatten, aber in der Kür zahlreiche schwere Fehler machten, die sie auf den dritten Rang zurückwarfen, schlug Trainer Ingo Steuer vor, ihre geplante Kür zu „You’ll Never Walk Alone“ zu verwerfen und eine neue zu erstellen. Obwohl sie seit Mai 2008 daran gearbeitet hatten, fühlten sie sich mit dieser Kür nicht wohl. Savchenko meinte, dass die Kür einfach nicht zu ihnen passe. Die neue Kür wurde zur Filmmusik von Out of Africa choreografiert. Bei Skate Canada gewannen sie sowohl das Kurzprogramm als auch die Kür und dies mit neuem Punkteweltrekord. Es war das erste Mal, dass ein Punktrichter die Höchstnote 10,0 im neuen Bewertungssystem vergab. Beim Grand-Prix-Finale reichte es jedoch erneut nur zur Bronzemedaille. Dazu kam, dass Aljona Savchenko während des Wettbewerbs eine Grippe bekam und das Paar somit nicht bei den deutschen Meisterschaften antreten konnte. Die Europameisterschaft in Turin beendeten Savchenko und Szolkowy mit einer persönlichen Bestleistung von 211,72 Punkten. Dennoch reichte dies nicht zur Titelverteidigung. Die Russen Juko Kawaguti und Alexander Smirnow gewannen überraschend den Titel mit anderthalb Punkten Vorsprung. Die zweiten Olympischen Spiele des Paares begannen in Vancouver mit einer persönlichen Bestleistung von 75,96 Punkten im Kurzprogramm. Dennoch brachte ihnen dies nicht den Sieg im Kurzprogramm, da die zurückgekehrten Chinesen Shen Xue und Zhao Hongbo mit 76,66 Punkten einen neuen Weltrekord aufstellten. Wegen eines verpatzten Doppelaxels von Szolkowy und eines nur zweifach gesprungenen Toeloops von Savchenko in der Kür fielen sie auch noch hinter das zweite chinesische Paar Pang Qing und Tong Jian zurück und gewannen somit die Bronzemedaille. Trainer Ingo Steuer kommentierte dies mit folgenden Worten: "Das Gold ist weg, alles andere ist egal. Ich bin sauer. Das ist so traurig, dass man das, was auf dem Tablett liegt, nicht genommen hat. Wir hätten es einfach machen müssen." Für seine öffentliche Kritik an seinen Eiskunstlaufschützlingen wurde Steuer in den Medien kritisiert. Bei der Weltmeisterschaft gewannen Savchenko und Szolkowy die Silbermedaille hinter Pang Qing und Tong Jian. Saison 2010/2011 Nachdem sie in 15 Shows aufgetreten waren, begann für Savchenko und Szolkowy die Saison 2010/11 mit souveränen Siegen bei Skate America und der Trophée Eric Bompard. Auch das Grand-Prix-Finale konnten sie für sich entscheiden, zum zweitenmal in ihrer Karriere. Dabei schien eine Teilnahme daran gefährdet, als im Flugzeug auf dem Weg von der Trophée Eric Bompard in Frankreich zurück ihr Gepäck verloren ging und damit auch die speziell auf sie abgestimmten Schlittschuhe. Diese dürfen nicht im Handgepäck mitgeführt werden, da sie als potenzielle Waffen zählen. Ein paar Tage später wurden die Schlittschuhe von der Fluggesellschaft jedoch wieder aufgefunden. Bei der Europameisterschaft in Bern holten sich Savchenko und Szolkowy ihren im vergangenen Jahr verlorenen EM-Titel von den Russen Kawaguti und Smirnow zurück. Als Höhepunkt zum Abschluss der Saison stand nun die Weltmeisterschaft in Tokio an. Nach dem Erdbeben in Japan am 11. März 2011 und den dadurch verursachten schwerwiegenden Folgen (unter anderem der Nuklearkatastrophe von Fukushima) konnte die Weltmeisterschaft allerdings nicht wie geplant Ende März stattfinden. Savchenko und Szolkowy sowie deren Trainer Ingo Steuer gaben bekannt, sich angesichts der Katastrophe eine Teilnahme an einer möglichen Austragung in Japan nur schwer vorstellen zu können. Die ISU verlegte die Weltmeisterschaft jedoch nach Moskau, wo sie über einen Monat später stattfand. Ein Problem ergab sich nun daraus, dass die Eiszeit von Savchenko und Szolkowys Trainingshalle in Chemnitz auf Ende März begrenzt ist. Man fand jedoch eine Lösung, um die Halle bis Ostern nutzbar zu machen. Die daraus entstehenden Kosten, rund 40000 Euro, teilten sich das Bundesinnenministerium, das sächsische Kultusministerium und die Stadt Chemnitz. Bei der Weltmeisterschaft in Moskau schoben sich Savchenko und Szolkowy durch ihre sauber ausgeführte Kür zur Musik von "Der rosarote Panther" vom zweiten auf den ersten Rang und gewannen damit zum dritten Mal den Weltmeistertitel, so oft wie kein anderes deutsches Paar in der Nachkriegsgeschichte. Sowohl die Punktzahl für die Kür, 144,87, als auch die Gesamtpunktzahl von 217,85 bedeuteten dabei einen neuen Weltrekord. Savchenko und Szolkowy gewannen somit alle Wettbewerbe in der Saison 2010/2011, bei denen sie angetreten waren. Saison 2011/2012 In der Saison 2011/12 gewannen Savchenko und Szolkowy nach 2007/08 und 2010/11 zum dritten Mal das Grand-Prix-Finale, diesmal vor dem russischen Paar Tatjana Wolossoschar und Maxim Trankow. Nach einem am 19. Januar 2012 erlittenen Muskelfaserriss im linken Oberschenkel Savchenkos konnte das Paar trotz bereits erfolgter Anreise nicht an der Ende Januar stattfindenden Europameisterschaft in Sheffield teilnehmen und seinen Titel verteidigen. Dieser ging an die Russen Wolossoschar/Trankow. Ende März 2012 konnte das deutsche Eiskunstlaufpaar jedoch an der Weltmeisterschaft in Nizza teilnehmen. Bereits nach dem Kurzprogramm, in dem Savchenko und Szolkowy zum ersten Mal erfolgreich einen dreifachen Wurfaxel gezeigt hatten, übernahmen sie die Führung. Diese gaben sie auch nach ihrer neuartigen Kür, die vom Tanztheater Pina Bauschs inspiriert worden war und trotz zweier größerer Fehler nicht ab und errangen mit einem äußerst knappen Vorsprung von 0,11 Punkten vor ihren russischen Rivalen, zum vierten Mal den Weltmeistertitel. Damit stellten sie den deutschen Titelrekord von Maxi Herber und Ernst Baier ein, die im Zeitraum von 1936 bis 1939 ebenfalls viermal bei Weltmeisterschaften gewannen. In der Paarlaufgeschichte waren lediglich Irina Rodnina und Alexander Saizew (sechs Titel) öfter siegreich bei Weltmeisterschaften. Saison 2012/2013 Die Saison 2012/13 begann mit einem Sieg bei Skate Canada, obwohl Szolkowy grippegeschwächt angetreten war. Die Teilnahme an der Trophée Eric Bompard mussten Savchenko und Szolkowy allerdings aufgrund der Erkrankung, die sich zu einer Nebenhöhlenentzündung entwickelt hatte, absagen und konnten sich somit nicht für das Grand-Prix-Finale qualifizieren. Kritik ernteten Savchenko und Szolkowy schon früh in der Saison für die Auswahl ihrer Musik, des im Eiskunstlauf häufig verwendeten Boléro und ihrer allzu farbenfrohen Kostüme, die ein Designerstudio in Chemnitz entworfen hatte. Eine gute Nachricht zu Saisonbeginn dagegen war die Unterzeichnung eines dreijährigen Vertrages mit dem ersten Großsponsor ihrer Karriere, dem Investment-Unternehmen ThomasLloyd in Berlin. Szolkowy kommentierte: "Zu wissen, dass wir uns auf das Training und den Wettkampf allein konzentrieren können, ist ein gutes Gefühl. Wir müssen uns jetzt nicht zwingend jeden Monat um die Finanzen kümmern." Bei der Europameisterschaft in Zagreb und der Weltmeisterschaft im kanadischen London mussten sich Savchenko und Szolkowy mit der Silbermedaille hinter ihren Konkurrenten Tatjana Wolossoschar und Maxim Trankow zufriedengeben. Dabei verloren sie auch ihre Punkteweltrekorde in Kür und Gesamtleistung an die Russen. Saison 2013/2014 Die olympische Saison begann für das Chemnitzer Eiskunstlaufpaar vielversprechend, mit Siegen bei beiden ihrer Grand-Prix-Wettbewerbe, dem Cup of China und dem Cup of Russia. Es waren die Siege Nummer 13 und 14 bei Grand-Prix-Wettbewerben. Den Cup of China gewannen Savchenko und Szolkowy zum ersten Mal. Damit komplettierten sie ihre Goldmedaillensammlung bei den sechs Grand-Prix-Wettbewerben, als erst zweites Paar in der Geschichte nach Shen Xue und Zhao Hongbo. Es war außerdem das neunte Jahr in Folge, in dem Savchenko und Szolkowy mindestens einen Grand-Prix für sich entscheiden konnten. Beim Grand-Prix-Finale konnten die Deutschen durch eine persönliche Bestleistung in der Kür von 227,03 Punkten ihre großen Konkurrenten Tatjana Wolossoschar und Maxim Trankow besiegen. Es war der insgesamt vierte Sieg ihrer Karriere beim Grand-Prix-Finale. Die Europameisterschaft in Budapest musste das Eiskunstlaufpaar nach dem Kurzprogramm aufgrund eines viralen Infektes der oberen Atemwege bei Aljona Savchenko absagen. Ihre dritten Olympischen Spiele beendeten Savchenko und Szolkowy in Sotschi nach Fehlern in der Kür, wie schon vier Jahre zuvor, lediglich auf dem Bronzerang. Das deutsche Paar hatte in dieser Kür alles riskieren müssen, da es bereits trotz einer persönlichen Bestleistung von 79,64 Punkten im Kurzprogramm gegen seine russischen Konkurrenten aufgrund der Wertung der Punktrichter ins Hintertreffen geraten war. Frenetisch angefeuert vom Publikum nutzten Tatjana Wolossoschar und Maxim Trankow ihren Heimvorteil und siegten vor ihren russischen Landsleuten Ksenija Stolbowa und Fedor Klimow. Beim letzten gemeinsamen Wettbewerb ihrer Wettkampfkarriere, der Weltmeisterschaft im japanischen Saitama, gewannen Aljona Savchenko und Robin Szolkowy die Goldmedaille vor dem russischen Duo Stolbowa/Klimow und dem kanadischen Paar Duhamel/Radford. Es war der insgesamt fünfte Titel des deutschen Eiskunstlaufpaares bei Weltmeisterschaften. Mehr Titel in der Geschichte schafften nur Irina Rodnina und Alexander Saizew (6). Szolkowy hatte bereits einige Zeit vorher bekannt gegeben, seine Karriere nach der Weltmeisterschaft zu beenden. Er begründete dies folgendermaßen: "Mein Körper sendet klare Signale. Mit der Schnellkraft und den Sprüngen tue ich mich schwerer als noch vor ein paar Jahren." 
G;|Letitia Elizabeth Landon (* 14. August 1802 in Chelsea (London); † 15. Oktober 1838 in Cape Coast Castle, Goldküste) war eine britische Dichterin und Romanschriftstellerin. Häufig schrieb die zu ihrer Zeit in Großbritannien wohlbekannte Autorin unter dem Pseudonym ihrer Initialen, L. E. L. Kurz nach ihrer im Juni 1838 zelebrierten Heirat mit George Maclean, dem Gouverneur von Cape Coast Castle, segelte sie mit diesem zu dem in Westafrika gelegenen britischen „Schutzgebiet“, starb dort aber wenige Monate später unter mysteriösen Umständen.    Frühes Leben Die am 14. August 1802 in 25 Hans Place in Chelsea zur Welt gekommene Letitia Elizabeth Landon entspross einer britischen Oberschichtfamilie, die vor Letitias Geburt aber wegen der Südseeblase viel von ihrem Vermögen eingebüßt hatte. Letitia war das älteste Kind des Heereslieferanten John Landon und einer Mutter walisischer Abstammung, Catherine Jane, geb. Bishop. Ihr Großvater, der ebenso wie ihr Vater John Landon hieß, war als Landpfarrer scharf gegen Dissenters eingestellt. Außer ihrem zwei Jahre jüngeren Bruder Whittington Henry, zu dem sie stets ein enges Verhältnis pflegte, hatte sie eine jüngere Schwester Elizabeth Jane, die von schwacher Gesundheit war und 1825 im Alter von nur 13 Jahren starb. Schon seit früher Kindheit beherrschte Letitia Landon das Lesen. Ab ihrem fünften Lebensjahr besuchte sie in 22 Hans Place in Chelsea zwei Jahre lang dieselbe von der Dichterin Frances Rowden geleitete Schule, in der Mary Russell Mitford und Caroline Lamb ihre Bildung erhalten hatten. Hier erlangte Letitia gute Kenntnisse des Französischen. 1809 übersiedelten die Landons in ein großes Landhaus namens Trevor Park, das nahe East Barnet, einer Gegend im heutigen Norden Londons, lag. John Landon beschäftigte sich nun mit dem Projekt der Führung eines landwirtschaftlichen Musterbetriebs auf der nahegelegenen Coventry Farm. Letitia wurde inzwischen von ihrer älteren Kusine Elizabeth erzogen, las gerne, etwa Defoes Roman Robinson Crusoe, und zeigte bald Ansätze ihrer schriftstellerischen Begabung. Sie verstand es, lange Geschichten zu erfinden, die sie auch in metrische Form zu kleiden wusste. Oft durchwandelte sie die Spaziergänge des Trevor Park oder sie durchwachte die Nacht, indem sie laut ihre Verse hersagte. Die Misswirtschaft des Verwalters seiner Farm und der Bankrott der Heereslieferagentur Adair & Co, an der er beteiligt war, brachten John Landon in eine schwierige finanzielle Lage, so dass er und seine Familie 1815 zuerst nach Fulham und 1816 nach Old Brompton umzogen, wo sie relativ abgeschieden lebten. Frühe literarische Tätigkeit Die Umstände ihrer Familie führten die in der Übergangsphase von der Hochromantik zum Viktorianismus schreibenden Letitia Landon als junge Frau zur Veröffentlichung der Erzeugnisse ihrer Feder, die längere Zeit in kleineren Liedern und größeren episch-lyrischen Gedichten bestanden, bis sie später auch in Romanen einen glänzenden Prosastil entwickelte. In Old Brompton machte Landon die Bekanntschaft ihres Nachbarn William Jerdan, Herausgeber der einflussreichen wöchentlichen Literaturzeitschrift Literary Gazette, dem ihre Mutter ihre frühen poetischen Versuche zur Durchsicht übergab. Jerdan schätzte Landons Lyrik recht positiv ein, so dass als ihr erstes veröffentlichtes Werk das Kurzgedicht Rome am 11. März 1820 in der Literary Gazette erschien; unterzeichnet war es mit der Initiale L. Landon hoffte nun, durch ihre Schriftstellerei einiges Geld zu verdienen, da auch weiterhin ihre Gedichte von Jerdan publiziert wurden, der ihr treuester literarischer Freund blieb und nicht wenig zur Anerkennung ihres dichterischen Ruhms beitrug. Mit monetärer Unterstützung durch ihre Großmutter und deren Freundin, die Schauspielerin Sarah Siddons, gab sie unter ihrem vollständigen Namen im August 1821 die Gedichtsammlung The Fate of Adelaide. A Swiss Romantic tale and other poems heraus, die sich ganz gut verkaufte, woraus aber die Autorin aufgrund des einen Monat später erfolgten Bankrotts ihres Verlags keinen finanziellen Profit ziehen konnte. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt begann Landon in Jerdans Auftrag mit regelmäßigen Veröffentlichungen von Poetical Sketches in der Literary Gazette, welche Beiträge zu dieser Zeitschrift sie unter dem Pseudonym „L. E. L.“ kontinuierlich bis zum Sommer 1824 schrieb. Zwar war ihr Lohn für diese schriftstellerische Betätigung gering, doch das öffentliche Interesse an der unbekannten Dichterin stieg beträchtlich und Spekulationen über ihre Identität blühten. Jerdan gab nicht bekannt, wer sie war, verriet aber bald angesichts zahlreicher Anfragen, dass es sich um eine junge Lady im Teenager-Alter handle. Landon wirkte in der Literary Gazette auch als einflussreiche Rezensentin, verfasste ihre Buchkritiken aber stets anonym, so dass ihr nur wenige zugeordnet werden können. 1824 erschien Landons über 300 Seiten umfassendes Werk The Improvisatrice, and other poems, das auf geteilte Beurteilung der Literaturkritiker stieß, aber viel Anklang beim Großteil ihrer Leserschaft fand und im ersten Jahr sechs Auflagen durchlief. Die junge Titelheldin, die Improvisatrice (d. h. Stegreifdichterin), erzählt darin als Rahmenhandlung die traurige Geschichte ihrer Liebe zu Lorenzo, der diese zwar erwidert, aber bereits mit einer anderen Frau namens Ianthe verlobt ist und sie auch heiratet. Nach dem Tod seiner Frau will er zu seiner Geliebten zurückkehren, die aber mittlerweile aus Liebeskummer ebenfalls verschieden ist und nur noch als Apollonpriesterin auf einem Gemälde sichtbar bleibt. In eingestreuten Berichten und Liedern schildert sie auch andere unglückliche Liebesbeziehungen. Im gleichen Jahr 1824, kurz vor der Veröffentlichung der Improvisatrice, starb Landons Vater im Alter von 68 Jahren. Seine Familie verfügte damals nur über bescheidene finanzielle Mittel. Da sie sich mit ihrer Mutter zerstritt, zog Landon zu ihrer Großmutter mütterlicherseits, Mrs. Bishop, in die Londoner Sloane Street. Sie verwendete aber ihre mit der Zeit bedeutenden Einnahmen weiterhin größtenteils auf die Bezahlung der universitären Ausbildung ihres jüngeren Bruders Whittington Henry und zur Unterstützung ihrer Mutter. Die Veröffentlichung von The Troubadour. Catalogue of pictures, and historical sketches (1825) machte sie literarisch noch populärer, doch führten ihr gesellschaftlicher Stand als unabhängige, allein stehende Frau und die bevorzugte Thematisierung der Liebe in ihrer Lyrik dazu, dass ihr zahlreiche angebliche Affären unterstellt wurden. Boulevardmedien wie The Wasp brachten Skandalberichte über sie; so wurde 1826 darin behauptet, dass sie von Jerdan schwanger geworden sei. Laut einer im Jahr 2000 veröffentlichten Studie von Cynthia Lawford in der London Review of Books habe Landon tatsächlich eine 15-jährige geheime Liaison mit Jerdan gehabt und ihm zwischen 1822 und 1829 drei uneheliche Kinder, Ella, Fred and Laura, geboren. Landon und ihre Freunde bemühten sich stets, Gerüchte über ihr Sexualleben zu zerstreuen. Als ihre Großmutter 1826 starb, übersiedelte Landon in eine Mansardenwohnung in ihrer alten Schule am Hans Place, die nun von den Damen Lance betrieben wurde. Sie publizierte die beiden Gedichtsammlungen The Golden Violet, with its tales of Romance and Chivalry; and other poems (1827) und The Venetian Bracelet, The Lost Pleiad, A History of the Lyre, and other poems (1829), deren langen Titelgedichte eine große Ähnlichkeit zu jenen ihrer früheren Werke The Improvisatrice und The Troubadour sowie jenem ihrer 1835 verfassten Sammlung The Vow of the Peacock, and other poems aufweisen. Den Inhalt dieser größeren lyrisch-epischen Dichtungen bilden Rittertum, Gesang und unglückliche Liebe. Ihr wachsender Ruhm schlug sich in zunehmender Nachahmung ihres dichterischen Stils nieder. Die Anstrengungen ihrer umfangreichen schriftstellerischen Tätigkeit trugen aber zu ihren häufigen Krankheiten wie Kopfschmerzen und Nervenleiden bei. Spätere Karriere als Romanschriftstellerin Ab 1830 begann Landon mit dem Verfassen von Romanen, in denen sie die gereiften Erfahrungen ihres Lebens niederlegte. Zu diesem teilweisen Wechsel der Literaturgattung trug die Erkenntnis bei, dass der Roman nunmehr ein gefragteres Genre als die Dichtung wurde und dass sie durch ein Debüt auf diesem Gebiet wieder größeren öffentlichen Beifall finden und in der Folge ihre Finanzen weiter aufbessern könnte. In ihrem ersten Roman Romance and Reality (1831), der sich gut verkaufte, zeigte sie einen ganz anderen Schreibstil als in ihrer Lyrik, und die Rezensenten lobten ihre darin enthüllte geistreiche, satirische Kommentierung modernen Lebens. Das Werk ist ebenso wie ihre Romane Francesca Carrara (1834) und Ethel Churchill (1837) reich an lyrischem Gehalt, kräftig in der Charakterzeichnung und wirksam durch die Gruppierungen. Wie in Jane Austens Sense and Sensibility (1811) wird in Romance and Reality der Gegensatz seiner beiden Heldinnen herausgestellt. Die Autorin flicht in die Handlung auch ziemlich moralisierende Reflexionen ein. Nun hatte sich Landon als fester Bestandteil der Londoner Literaturszene etabliert und nahm an zahlreichen Literaturtreffen teil, auf denen sie viele Besucher für sich einnehmen konnte, wenngleich sich etwa Disraeli ihr gegenüber abgeneigt zeigte. Die oft porträtierte, dunkelhaarige und braunäugige Autorin scheint sich sehr modebewusst gegeben und insbesondere exotischen Modetrends angehangen zu haben; so erscheint sie auf zahlreichen ihrer Bildnisse in Kleidern mit wallenden Keulenärmeln und enorme Hüte tragend. In ihrem zweiten Roman Francesca Carrara entwirft Landon ein Porträt der royalistischen und puritanischen Parteiungen im England des 17. Jahrhunderts und am Hof Ludwigs XIV. Die fiktive, romantisch dargestellte Hauptfigur ist in eine melodramatische, wenngleich unwahrscheinliche Handlung eingebettet, die vor einem authentischen historischen Hintergrund spielt. Im Juni 1834 unternahm Landon eine Vergnügungsreise nach Paris. Obwohl sie die Gelegenheit hatte, Persönlichkeiten wie Heine und Chateaubriand zu treffen, langweilten sie die Besichtigungstouren in der französischen Hauptstadt sowie der Umstand, dass es nur wenige bedeutende gesellschaftliche Ereignisse gab, die einen Besuch lohnten. 1834 verlobte sich Landon mit dem 10 Jahre jüngeren Publizisten John Forster, dem späteren Biographen von Charles Dickens. Doch die Mitte der 1820er Jahre erhobenen Vorwürfe anstößigen Umgangs mit Jerdan lebten wieder auf und wurden auf Verhältnisse mit William Maginn, Daniel Maclise und Edward Bulwer-Lytton ausgeweitet. Forster forderte von Landon eine Widerlegung dieser Gerüchte, woraufhin sie ihm empfahl, hierzu ihre Freunde zu befragen. Zwar zeigte sich Forster danach von ihrer Unschuld überzeugt und bat sie um ihre Hand, doch sie löste stattdessen die Verlobung auf, und zwar nach ihrer Darstellung gegenüber ihrem Freund Bulwer-Lytton, da sie keine Ehe mit einem Mann von so wenig Feingefühl eingehen wolle. Für einige Zeit war sie nun sehr depressiv. Landons 1836 veröffentlichtes Werk Traits and Trails of Early life, das Anfang der 1840er Jahre bereits seine dritte Auflage erlebte, stellt eine Gruppe von moralistischen Kurzgeschichten für junge Leute dar und sollte wohl das neuentdeckte jugendliche Publikum als Leserschaft gewinnen. Eine bemerkenswerte Weiterentwicklung ihrer Romantechnik und eine realistischere Darstellung der Charaktere zeigte Landon in Ethel Churchill (1837). Der typisch frühviktorianische Roman wurde trotz mancher Schwächen wie zu großer Sentimentalität und überhäufiger Einschübe persönlicher Betrachtungen der Autorin von englischen Literaturkritikern für ihr gelungenstes Prosawerk gehalten. Ferner schrieb Landon seit den frühen 1820er Jahren viele kleinere Gedichte für die Literary Gazette, das New Monthly Magazine und andere Zeitschriften sowie insbesondere für einige damals sehr in Mode befindliche Almanache, Vorläufer moderner luxuriöser Bildbände. Ihre Dichtungen zeichnen sich durch sanfte Wehmut, zartes Gefühl, reiche Fantasie und gelungenen Ausdruck aus. Beispielsweise gab sie ab 1832 Fisher’s Drawing Room Scrap Book heraus und verfasste dessen gesamten lyrischen Inhalt zu darin abgebildeten Stichen. Viele dieser Gedichte schrieb sie zur Illustration von Stichen aus dem Skizzenbuch von Captain Robert Elliott, der für die Britische Ostindien-Kompanie tätig gewesen und ein Freund von Landons einstiger Hausgenossin Emma Roberts war. Am Ende der 1835er-Ausgabe von Fisher’s Drawing Room Scrap Book inkludierte Landon u .a. das acht Seiten umfassende, den Mythos der Schlangenfrau Melusine verarbeitende Poem The Fairy of the Fountains, das mit Samuel Taylor Coleridges Christabel und John Keats Ballade La Belle Dame sans Merci (1819) konkurriert. Außerdem entwarf Landon auch die Gedichte zu The Easter Gift (1832), zum Book of Beauty(1833) und zu den Flowers of Loveliness (1838). Die größte Meisterschaft in der improvisationsartigen Kunst, aus Gemälden Stoffe für Gelegenheitsgedichte zu ziehen, bewies sie in ihren Subjects for pictures (New Monthly Magazine, 1836-38). Heirat und Tod Im Oktober 1836 traf Landon bei einer im Haus von Matthew Forster abgehaltenen Tischgesellschaft George Maclean, Gouverneur von Cape Coast Castle (im heutigen Ghana), der sich gerade auf Heimaturlaub befand. Bald begannen die beiden eine Beziehung. Doch Anfang des nächsten Jahres verließ Maclean die Autorin zu deren Verdruss wieder und zog sich nach Schottland zurück. Gerüchteweise sollte er schon eine afrikanische Frau haben. Auf Drängen von Landons Freunden kam Maclean schließlich wieder nach London und heiratete Landon dort heimlich am 7. Juni 1838 in der Kirche St Mary’s, Bryanston Square. Am 5. Juli, kurz nach der Krönung Königin Victorias, segelte das frisch getraute Ehepaar von der südenglischen Hafenstadt Portsmouth ab, nahm Kurs auf die westafrikanische Küste und kam am 16. August 1838 an seinem Reiseziel, Cape Coast Castle, an. Landons während der folgenden zwei Monate verfasste Briefe an Freunde geben widersprüchliche Berichte über ihre Gesundheit und Gefühle. Nach diesem kurzen Zeitraum starb sie unter geheimnisvollen Umständen. Am Morgen des 15. Oktober 1838 wurde sie von ihrer Dienerin, Emily Bailey, tot in ihrem Schlafzimmer gefunden. Sie lag ausgestreckt am Boden; ihre Hand hielt ein leeres Fläschchen mit Blausäure. Bei einer am folgenden Nachmittag vorgenommenen gerichtlichen Untersuchung vertrat der diensttuende Arzt die Ansicht, dass keine Autopsie notwendig sei. Doch die eidesstattlichen Aussagen der Zeugen, u. a. von Maclean und Mrs. Bailey, sind widersprüchlich und lückenhaft. Die Leichenbeschaukommission schrieb die Ursache des Todes der Dichterin der unvorsichtigen Einnahme einer Überdosis der Blausäure zu, welche hochgiftige Substanz sie in stark verdünnter Form als Arznei gegen Krämpfe angewendet habe. Landons Leichnam wurde am selben Abend am Übungsplatz von Cape Coast Castle beigesetzt. Die mysteriösen Umstände von Landons im Alter von nur 36 Jahren erfolgtem Tod sowie die hastige und ungenaue Prüfung von dessen Ursache führten in England zu Spekulationen, dass die Dichterin sich selbst getötet habe oder das Opfer der Rache der angeblichen ehemaligen afrikanischen Geliebten ihres Gatten geworden sei. Auch Maclean selbst wurde des Mordes an seiner Gemahlin verdächtigt. Doch trotz der Bemühungen ihrer Familie und mancher ihrer Freunde, die bald zahlreiche Denkschriften über die Verblichene verfassten, konnte die offizielle Version einer versehentlichen Vergiftung nicht widerlegt werden. Ihre Todesumstände gelten aber nach wie vor als nicht zufriedenstellend erklärt. Aufgrund ihres frühen und geheimnisumwitterten Ablebens blieb sie ihren Landsleuten lange in Erinnerung. Auf spätere viktorianische Dichterinnen wie Elizabeth Barrett Browning übte sie beträchtlichen Einfluss aus. |
G;|Laurenz Zellweger (* 2. August 1692 in Trogen; † 14. Mai 1764 in Trogen) war ein bedeutender Schweizer Aufklärer, Arzt und Mitbegründer der Helvetischen Gesellschaft.  Familie Laurenz Zellweger wurde in eine protestantische Familie von Textilkaufleuten hineingeboren. Sein Familienzweig war in den 1580er Jahren, zur Zeit der Gegenreformation und am Vorabend der Landteilung, von Appenzell nach Trogen ausgewandert. Der Immigrantenfamilie war es gelungen, seit der zweiten Hälfte des 17. Jahrhunderts eine wichtige politische Stellung und wirtschaftliche Bedeutung im Stand Appenzell Ausserrhoden zu erlangen. Mit Ausnahme weniger Jahre sassen von 1668 bis 1732 immer zwei Zellweger, der eine aus der Trogner-Linie, der andere aus Teufen, in den hohen Landesämtern. Zudem verschwägerten sich beide Zellweger-Linien mit der Familie Tanner von Herisau, einem führenden Geschlecht des Appenzeller Hinterlandes. Die Zellweger und Tanner hatten bedeutenden Einfluss auf die Entwicklung Ausserrhodens, denn ihre hohen politischen Ämter brachten eine grosse Machtfülle mit sich. Mit dem sich einstellenden wirtschaftlichen Erfolg wurde diese Machtstellung noch weiter gefestigt. Für den ökonomischen Aufstieg der Zellweger von Trogen legte Laurenz Zellwegers Grossvater, Conrad Zellweger-Rechsteiner (1630–1705), den Grundstein. Er eröffnete 1667 in Trogen eine Leinwandschau. Bis dahin hatten die zahlreichen, meist auf dem Land lebenden Weber ihre Erzeugnisse in die benachbarte Stadt St. Gallen zur Leinwandschau bringen müssen. Dort wurden sie allerdings vom Verkauf und von der weiteren Verarbeitung der Stoffe ausgeschlossen. Mit der Eröffnung der Leinwandschau in Trogen konnte dieser Handel nun ohne sanktgallische Zunftordnung und mit kürzeren Transportwegen abgeschlossen werden. Aufgrund dieser Vorteile blühte das Geschäft in Trogen rasch auf, und Conrad Zellweger-Rechsteiner begann bald selber Textilien zu verarbeiten und zu vertreiben. So brachte es Laurenz Zellwegers Grossvater zu Wohlstand und er legte ein wichtiges Fundament für den weiteren wirtschaftlichen Aufstieg seiner Familie. Der Vater von Laurenz Zellweger, Conrad Zellweger-Tanner (1659–1749), der zweitgeborene Sohn von Conrad Zellweger-Rechsteiner, baute nach der Übernahme des väterlichen Geschäftes den Reichtum der Familie Zellweger noch weiter aus. Conrad Zellweger-Tanner hatte in einem St. Galler Leinwandhaus in Lyon eine kaufmännische Ausbildung erhalten, lebte dann rund zehn Jahre in Frankreich und gründete nach seiner Rückkehr nach Trogen schliesslich 1717 eine eigene Niederlassung in Lyon, die hauptsächlich von seinen beiden jüngeren Söhnen Conrad Zellweger (1694–1771) und Johannes Zellweger (1695–1774) geführt und auch ausgebaut wurde. In Trogen wurde Conrad Zellweger-Tanner, wie schon seine Vorfahren, in wichtige Landesämter einberufen. Er war Landeshauptmann, Seckelmeister und Landesstatthalter. Dennoch soll der gläubige Protestant bescheiden und einfach gelebt haben. Jugend und Ausbildung Laurenz Zellweger wollte sich entgegen dem Wunsch seiner Familie und im Gegensatz zu seinen Brüdern nicht zum Kaufmann ausbilden lassen. Die Eltern drängten ihn zunächst, Pfarrer zu werden, unterstützten dann aber seinen Wunsch, Medizin zu studieren. Diese Unterstützung war durchaus keine Selbstverständlichkeit. Sie legte beim Sohn den Grundstein für die Ehrfurcht und Verehrung, die Laurenz Zellweger seinen Eltern zeit seines Lebens entgegenbrachte. Zellweger wurde dann 1709 als Schüler zum Arzt und Naturforscher Johann Jakob Scheuchzer (1672–1733) in ein Lehrjahr geschickt. Im Rahmen von dessen siebter Alpenreise kam der junge Zellweger mit verschiedenen naturwissenschaftlichen Gebieten in Kontakt: Er machte meteorologische Beobachtungen, untersuchte verschiedene Arten von Wassern in den besuchten Bädern, schrieb Notizen zu Pflanzenarten und Gesteinsformationen auf und transkribierte Inschriften an Häusern und Monumenten. Die Anregungen, die Laurenz auf dieser Alpenreise erhielt, haben sich auf seine spätere Tätigkeit und seine Faszination für die Naturwissenschaften ausgewirkt. Mit Johann Jakob Scheuchzer blieb er in brieflichem Kontakt. 1710 begann Zellweger sein Medizinstudium an der Universität Leiden, wo 1713 seine Dissertation erschien. Hier lernte er seinen zweiten wichtigen Lehrer, den Universitätsdozenten, Mediziner und Botaniker Herman Boerhaave (1668–1738) kennen. Laurenz Zellweger verehrte Boerhaave und lernte von ihm, den Patienten vor allem zu beobachten und dann mit dem Verstand logische Schlüsse aus diesen Beobachtungen zu ziehen. In seiner Studienzeit in Leiden kam der junge Appenzeller auch mit Schriften aus England und den Ideen der Aufklärung in Kontakt. Über englische Studenten lernte Laurenz Zellweger Addisons und Steeles The Spectator, Paradise Lost von John Milton und den Philosophen John Locke kennen. Nach einer Reise über Paris, auf der er den Historiker Johann Jakob Lauffer (1688–1734) kennen lernte und als Freund gewann, kehrte Zellweger Ende 1713 wieder nach Trogen zurück, wo er als junger Arzt eine Praxis eröffnete. Beruflicher und politischer Werdegang In der ersten Zeit nach der Eröffnung seiner Praxis hatte Laurenz Zellweger Schwierigkeiten, das Vertrauen der Bevölkerung und damit Patienten zu gewinnen. Erst 1721 konnte er seinem Freund Johann Jakob Lauffer berichten, dass seine Praxis nun schon ganz gut besucht werde. Zellweger erarbeitete sich nach und nach einen Namen als bedeutender Arzt, sein Tätigkeitsbereich reichte von Urnäsch bis Rheineck. Zellweger arbeitete mit dem konsequenten Fokus auf Prävention und hatte bald den Ruf, für alles einen Rat zu wissen. Dieser gute Leumund führte dazu, dass Zellweger bisweilen bis zu fünfzig Visiten pro Tag zu bewältigen hatte. Besonders in schweren Fällen wurde Laurenz Zellweger immer wieder herbeigezogen. Sein Ruf als hervorragender Arzt gründete nicht zuletzt in seinen an der Universität Leiden erworbenen Fähigkeiten des Beobachtens und des geschickten Ausfragens der Patienten nach ihren Beschwerden. Zellweger war bald so geachtet, dass sogar der schwedische Königshof ihn als Arzt nach Stockholm holen wollte. Auch die Rheinecker und seine Zürcher Freunde hätten ihn gerne bei sich gehabt. Doch Zellweger lehnte immer ab, er wollte seinen Vater und nach dessen Tod 1749 seine angestammte Heimat nicht verlassen. Von Laurenz Zellweger sind kaum medizinischen Schriften überliefert. Er war denn auch nicht Forscher und Entdecker wie Johann Jakob Scheuchzer, vielmehr konzentrierte er sich auf das praktische Ausüben seines Berufes. Wie seine Vorfahren und Geschwister hatte auch Laurenz Zellweger verschiedene Ämter zugunsten des Standes Appenzell Ausserrhoden zu bekleiden. 1723 wurde er von seinem Vater und dem Grossen Rat während einer Reise nach Schaffhausen zurück nach Trogen beordert, um dort das Landesarchiv zu ordnen. Für Zellweger, der seiner Lebenseinstellung zufolge stolz darauf war, von niemandem Befehle annehmen zu müssen und sich nur um seinen Beruf und seine Freunde kümmern wollte, war dies ein harter Einschnitt. Er stürzte sich dennoch in die Arbeit und übergab nach intensiven Schaffensjahren das neu eingerichtete Archiv 1729 wieder dem Grossen Rat. Obwohl er sich stark gegen erneute Dienste am Land zu wehren versuchte, wurde er 1726 Ratsherr und Gemeindeschreiber. 1728 wurde Zellweger Examinator, 1729–1732 Ausserrhoder Landeszeugherr und 1732–1734 Grossrat und Landesarchivar. Infolge des Landhandels, einer innenpolitischen Auseinandersetzung um Zölle und um Macht und Ansehen zwischen den Ausserrhoder Familien Wetter und Tanner/Zellweger, wurde Zellweger als Parteigänger der sogenannten „Linden“, denen sein Vater, ein Mitglied der Landesregierung, als Haupt vorstand, von allen Ämtern verbannt. Laurenz Zellweger widmete sich infolge dieser Zäsur daraufhin voll und ganz seinem Hauptberuf als Arzt, seinen Studien sowie seinem Briefwechsel mit Johann Jakob Bodmer (1698–1783) und dessen Freundeskreis. Die Unruhen um den Landhandel hatten ihn aber auch dazu motiviert, die erlebten Geschehnisse aufzuschreiben. Mit der Zeit weitete sich diese Tätigkeit, Historisches aus dem Appenzellerland zu erforschen und niederzuschreiben, immer mehr aus. Privatleben In seinem Nachruf beschrieb Johann Caspar Hirzel (1725–1803) Laurenz Zellweger als mageren, grossen Mann, „bräunlich von Ansehen“, mit ernsthafter und nachdenklicher Mine und so gekleidet, dass man ihn „von dem gemeinen Mann kaum unterschied“. Diese Erscheinung schien viele auf den ersten Blick abgeschreckt zu haben, „aber man entdeckte bald etwas einnehmendes Menschenliebendes in seinen Zügen“. Bei ersten Begegnungen soll Laurenz Zellweger schüchtern und zurückhaltend gewesen sein, mit der Zeit habe er sich dann aber jeweils redseliger und belebter gezeigt und soll auch gescherzt haben. „Immer war er zufrieden und vergnügt […].“ Laurenz Zellweger blieb bewusst sein Leben lang ledig, er wollte nicht heiraten. Zu Lauffer sagte er 1719 einmal, dass eine Heirat für ihn ausgeschlossen sei. Er wollte aus „Liebe zu seiner Freiheit“ ledig bleiben. Nur einmal, als er sich im Alter vor Schmerzen kaum mehr bewegen konnte und stets auf fremde Hilfe angewiesen war, fand er, dass eine Ehefrau nicht zu verachten wäre. Zellweger war seinem Geburts- und Heimatort sehr treu: Trogen blieb das gesamte Leben lang sein Dreh- und Angelpunkt. Nach seiner Rückkehr aus Holland 1713 verliess er den Ort bis zu seinem Tod nie mehr länger als für Kurzaufenthalte bei Freunden in St. Gallen, Winterthur, Zürich oder Schaffhausen sowie für Kuraufenthalte in Hohenems. Er wohnte lange bei seinen Eltern, erwarb nach dem Tod seines Vaters 1749 das kleine Holzhaus am Landsgemeindeplatz, die „förene Hütte“. An deren Standort baute Laurenz Zellwegers Neffe Jakob Zellweger-Wetter (1723–1808) in den 1760er Jahren einen Steinpalast, das heutige Gemeindehaus. Die „förene Hütte“ wurde rund 500 Meter hangabwärts verschoben, wo sie heute noch steht. Briefwechsel Die Freundschaft mit dem Zürcher Literaten und Lehrer für Helvetische Geschichte, Johann Jakob Bodmer (1698–1783) bildete den Grundstein für Zellwegers Freundeskreis, mit dem er regelmässig brieflich korrespondierte. Dieser Freundeskreis begann sich ab 1721 durch den Kontakt mit der „Gesellschaft der Mahlern“ und mit dem Chorherren Johann Jakob Breitinger (1701–1776) zu etablieren. Nebst Bodmer kamen immer mehr Korrespondenzpartner hinzu, unter den rund 60 Briefpartnern von Laurenz Zellweger waren der Arzt Johann Caspar Hirzel (1725–1803) und dessen Lehrer und enger Vertrauter Johannes Gessner (1709–1790), der Kanzlist Johann Jakob Leu (1789–1768), die Brüder Leonhard und Johannes Meister, der Maler Johann Caspar Füssli (1706–1782) und der Dichter Salomon Gessner (1730–1788). In diesem Umfeld tauchten auch Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (1724–1803), Christoph Martin Wieland (1733–1813) und Ewald Christian von Kleist (1715–1759) auf. Ebenfalls in Kontakt mit den Zürchern und mit Zellweger standen die Winterthurer Martin Künzli (1709–1765), Johann Heinrich Waser (1713–1777) und Johann Georg Sulzer (1720–1779). Zum Freundeskreis gehörten weiter auch Persönlichkeiten aus St. Gallen wie der Jurist und Stadtschreiber Georg Zörnlin, der Historiker Jakob Wegelin (1721–1791), der Spitalschreiber Daniel Högger (1706?–1784?) und der Stiftsbibliothekar Pater Pius Kolb (1712–1762). Interessant an diesen Korrespondenzpartnern ist, dass die meisten eine, einige sogar fast zwei Generationen jünger waren als Zellweger. Hauptkorrespondenzpartner für Laurenz Zellweger war Johann Jakob Bodmer. Bodmer und Zellweger tauschten zu Beginn ihrer Freundschaft hauptsächlich Bücher aus, beispielsweise „Paradise Lost“ von John Milton, das Bodmer ins Deutsche übersetzte. Nach dem Muster von Joseph Addisons The Spectator gaben Zellweger und Bodmer von 1721 bis 1723 zudem ebenfalls eine moralische Wochenzeitschrift, „Die Discourse der Mahlern“, heraus. Der Stadtzürcher und der Appenzeller wurden zu engen Vertrauten und schrieben sich zwischen 1723 und 1764, also während mehr als 40 Jahren, regelmässig Briefe, die zum Teil im Rhythmus von drei Tagen zwischen Zürich und Trogen hin und her geschickt wurden. Von diesen zahlreichen Schreiben sind heute noch 820 Briefe erhalten. Für Bodmer wie auch für Zellweger stellte dieser Briefwechsel der Wichtigste in ihrem Gelehrtenleben dar. Aus dieser Freundschaft ergab sich dann auch, dass fast jedes Jahr eine Gruppe Zürcher für einige Wochen in Trogen zur Molken- und Schottenkur zusammenkam. Im Briefwechsel ist 1735 das erste Mal von Molken oder Schotten die Rede. Bodmer berichtet darin, dass seine Gesundheit auf Grund eines „Gemüths-Mistrübnis“ gelitten habe. Zellweger rät ihm darauf, dass er diesen, heutzutage wohl als Depression zu bezeichnenden, Gemütszustand mit einer Reise ins Appenzellerland kurieren könnte. 1737 reiste Bodmer mit seiner Frau dann tatsächlich zur Schottenkur nach Trogen, nachdem Zellweger auf Grund der bisher immer leeren Versprechen Bodmers allmählich enttäuscht reagiert hatte. Die darauf folgenden vier Wochen Aufenthalt in Trogen lobte Bodmer nach seiner Rückkehr in den höchsten Tönen. Der Aufenthalt an der frischen Luft und auf den Hügeln des Appenzellerlandes waren für Bodmer, den am „Getümmel der Welt“ leidenden Stadt-Zürcher, eine Oase des Rückzugs, ein Ort, der das Denken anrege. Mit diesem Besuch erlangte Zellweger in Bodmers Augen seinen Status als Autoritätsperson. Zellweger propagierte in seiner Kur, dass das Molkentrinken gut sei für die Entschlackung und dass man die Schotten dazu jeweils frühmorgens, immer zur gleichen Zeit, einnehmen sollte. Zusätzlich war Bewegung an der frischen Luft nötig, was oft im Besteigen des Gäbris, des Hausbergs von Trogen, erfüllt wurde. Die Praxis der Molkenkur hielt bis nach dem Tod Zellwegers an. Zellweger relativierte aber die Wirkung der Molkenkuren auch immer wieder und war der Meinung, dass die Molke nicht plötzlich alles Übel entfernen könne, vielmehr gehe es darum, allgemein besser auf die Gesundheit zu achten und sich nicht zu schaden. Unter den Anhängern von Bodmer, die jeweils mit zur Kur fuhren, befanden sich etwa Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock oder auch Christoph Martin Wieland. In der „förenen Hütte“ von Laurenz Zellweger besangen dann Bodmer und seine „Jünger“ in Oden und Epen den Weisen Laurenz Zellweger, den sie „Philocles“, „der für seine Freunde Berühmte“, nannten. Bodmer veröffentlichte 1747 die „Ode an Philokles“, eine Laudatio auf Zellweger und dessen Heimat Appenzell. Die Ode schildert einerseits die Landschaft, andererseits aber auch den moralischen Charakter der Einwohner. Es entsteht in dieser Ode ein Gegenbild zu den Verhältnissen in der Stadt. Auch die anderen Freunde von Zellweger lobten den Freiheitsdrang und den Patriotismus der Appenzeller, deren trockenen Witz und die urdemokratische Institution der Landsgemeinde. In den Augen der Zürcher Gäste wurde die Unverbrauchtheit des Appenzellerlandes zum idyllischen Gegenpol der Grossstadt Zürich stilisiert. Im Rahmen dieser Kuren entstand auch das „Quodlibet“, ein Trompe-l’oeil-Gemälde. Auf diesem Gemälde von Johann Caspar Füssli werden einige der „Schottenbrüder“ mit antiken Grössen in Verbindung gebracht und zu Pendants zusammengefügt. Dabei entstehen die Paarungen Johann Jakob Bodmer und Sokrates, Salomon Gessner und Platon, Johann Caspar Hirzel und Hippokrates, Johann Caspar Füssli und Melanthus und Laurenz Zellweger und Homer. Den Spruch „Gehe nicht krumm nach mannen die   richtige Wege gegangen,   kennst du nicht den geraden pfad, so   frage PHILOCLES“, der unter dem Bildnis von Laurenz Zellweger steht, schrieb Bodmer unter eine Skizze von Füssli. Die Skizze, die Zellweger zeigt, hatte Füssli auf ein Papier gemalt, das zum Abdecken des Honigtopfs verwendet wurde, wie der Arzt Johann Georg Schläpfer im 19. Jahrhundert aus mündlicher Überlieferung noch weiss: Spruch und Bildnis wurden später mehrmals reproduziert. |
G;|Johann Ulrich Zellweger (* 1. August 1804 in Trogen; † 19. Januar 1871 ebenda) war ein Schweizer Bankier, Publizist und Gründer der Basler Missions-Handlungs-Gesellschaft. Er war der Sohn von Landammann Jacob Zellweger, Erbauer des Rathauses auf dem Trogner Landsgemeindeplatz, und Anna Barbara Zellweger-Zuberbühler. In zweiter Ehe war er mit Cécile Ryhiner von Basel verheiratet. Das Paar hatte sieben Kinder.  Kindheit Ulrich Zellweger wurde als neuntes Kind von Jacob und Anna-Barbara Zellweger-Zuberbühler geboren. Nebst dem regulären Schulbesuch kam er in die Gunst einer Ausbildung durch einen Hauslehrer. Die Textilhandelsfamilie Zellweger gehörte zum ländlichen Grossbürgertum, das zur Zeit der Protoindustrialisierung in Appenzell Ausserrhoden durch den Fernhandel mit Baumwolle zu Reichtum und Ansehen gekommen war. Beim frühen Tod seiner Mutter im Jahre 1815 war Ulrich Zellweger elf Jahre alt. Der Schicksalsschlag veränderte die familiären und beruflichen Verhältnisse seines Vaters Jakob Zellweger. Der Lebensstil wurde eingeschränkt, da die Firma des Vaters nach dem Zusammenbruch der napoleonischen Herrschaft finanziell angeschlagen war. 1817 fallierte das Unternehmen «Zellweger & Comp.», die Familie musste unter anderem den Hauslehrer entlassen. Ulrich und seine Geschwister verliessen Trogen. Zusammen mit den Brüdern Eduard und Salomon Zellweger wurde Ulrich von seinem Vater nach Ludwigsburg gebracht. Jugend Ulrich Zellweger besuchte von 1816 bis 1819 Schulen in Ludwigsburg und Stuttgart. Zum Ende des Jahres 1819 trat er eine kaufmännische Lehre in einem Handelshaus in Marseille an. Die Lehre dauerte vier Jahre. Nach Ablauf der vier Jahre begab er sich nach London. In der Zwischenzeit war sein Vater verstorben. Die Verantwortung für die Waisenkinder übernahm unter anderem der Onkel Johann Caspar Zellweger. Dieser blieb ein Leben lang eine wichtige Bezugsperson für Ulrich Zellweger. Berufliche Laufbahn In London gründete Zellweger zusammen mit einem Freund aus Zürich eine eigene Firma mit dem Namen «Orelli & Zellweger». Die beiden Unternehmer hatten wenig Erfolg mit ihrer Firma. Es fehlte ihnen an Kontakten zu englischen Häusern und die Investitionen in die Räumlichkeiten, Einrichtungen und Maschinen für die Herstellung von Hornkämmen waren höher als der Ertrag. Ulrich Zellweger und sein Partner kämpften mit den Schulden, des Öfteren liess sich Zellweger Geld von seinem Onkel Johann Caspar überweisen. Die Bemühungen der beiden jungen Unternehmer halfen nichts. Nach sieben Jahren wurde die Firma geschlossen und Zellweger versuchte sein Glück in Übersee. Er ging nach Kuba, dem damals wichtigsten Handelsplatz der karibischen Inseln. Er reiste dorthin mit der Aussicht auf eine Anstellung beim Schweizer Zuckerplantagenbesitzer H. Stouder. Als er in Kuba ankam, erhielt er die Nachricht, dass sein künftiger Arbeitgeber kurz vor seiner Ankunft gestorben war. Er liess sich zuerst in Matanzas nieder, zog dann aber nach Havanna. Die ersten fünf Jahre in Havanna waren schwer. Zellweger beschäftigte sich mit den unterschiedlichsten Tätigkeiten und lebte sehr sparsam, damit er seine Schulden begleichen konnte. Eines Tages stand er in Kontakt mit Charles Drake, einem führenden Exporteur im kubanischen Zuckerhandel. Nach einer sechsmonatigen Probezeit wurde Ulrich Zellweger 1835 als Teilhaber in die Firma «Charles Drake & Co.» aufgenommen. Die Arbeit in dieser Firma sicherte Ulrich ein reichliches Einkommen. In den Jahren 1836 und 1840 besuchte Zellweger Europa und das Appenzellerland. Das Unternehmen wurde im Jahre 1839 liquidiert. Dies war jedoch kein Misserfolg für Ulrich Zellweger. Er konnte die Nachfolgefirma mit dem Namen «Drake Brothers & Co.» zusammen mit Joseph M. Morales und Charles Respinger, einem Basler, übernehmen. Die Firma hatte intensiven Kontakt zur Schweiz, insbesondere mit der Firma «Burckhardt-Wildt & Sohn» in Basel. «Burckhardt-Wildt & Sohn» lieferte Seidenbänder nach Kuba und bezog dafür Zigarren und andere Kolonialwaren. Das Unternehmen entwickelte sich später zur Handelsbank «Forcart-Weis & Burckhardt-Wildt». Ulrich Zellwegers Handelsbeziehungen führten ihn von Havanna bis nach Nordamerika, wo er sich mit zahlreichen Persönlichkeiten aus führenden Kreisen der Wirtschaft traf. Im Austausch mit den erfolgreichen und vermögenden amerikanischen Kaufleuten, darunter etwa mit dem Bankier und Immobilienbesitzer John Jacob Astor (1822–1890) und den New Yorker Unternehmensbankiers Prime, Ward, King & Co., hatte er ein Erweckungserlebnis. Er wurde zum frommen Protestanten und war ab dato gleichzeitig Unternehmer und christlicher Missionar. Zentrales Element seines Credo war die Überzeugung, dass sein Handeln und Denken vorbestimmt waren. Im Jahre 1846 verliess Zellweger Amerika und begab sich wieder nach Trogen in seinen Heimatort. Dort lebte er sechs Jahre als Privatier. Da er sehr vermögend war und dies auch kundtat, pilgerten Notleidende und Arme zu seinem Haus. Zellweger gab jedem etwas und gab allen den Rat, auf die göttliche Unterstützung zu vertrauen. Er wollte die Menschen auf den «richtigen» Weg lenken und wusste, dass man ihnen hierfür eine Ausbildung und eine Erwerbstätigkeit geben musste. So widmete er sich vermehrt der Armenfürsorge. Das erste wohltätige Engagement galt der Rettungsanstalt für Knaben in Bächtelen bei Bern. Der Aufbau der Anstalt war unter anderem seinem Onkel Johann Caspar Zellweger zu verdanken. Dieser war von 1839 bis 1847 Präsident der Anstalt. Ulrich Zellweger wurde um finanzielle Unterstützung angefragt. Johann Caspar Zellweger gehörte der «engeren» Kommission der Bächtelen an, und der Neffe sass im «weiteren» Komitee. Er nahm an Sitzungen teil, inspizierte neue Schulzimmer und interessierte sich besonders für den Religionsunterricht. Als Ulrich Zellweger nach Paris ging, um sich seinen Bankgeschäften zu widmen, schied er als Mitglied des weiteren Komitees aus. Die erste Eisenbahn der Schweiz, die «Spanisch-Brötli-Bahn», wurde 1847 eingeweiht. Bereits zwei Jahre später engagierte sich Ulrich Zellweger für den Eisenbahnbau. Sein Plan war zunächst, Zürich, Basel, Aarau, Solothurn und Bern mit Eisenbahnlinien zu verbinden. Zellweger setzte sich für eine Realisierung ein. Doch erst mit dem Eisenbahngesetz 1852 wurde der Bau von Eisenbahnlinien geregelt, und ein Eisenbahnbauboom begann. Im Revolutionsjahr 1848 hatte Zellweger Angst sein Vermögen zu verlieren, das er grössten Teils in französischen Papieren angelegt hatte. Die politischen Unruhen in Frankreich gefährdeten deren Sicherheit, so dass Zellweger kurzerhand nach Paris umsiedelte und zusammen mit seinem Geschäftsfreund Charles Respinger das Bankhaus «Zellweger & Cie.» in Paris gründete. Die Bank verschaffte sich einen hervorragenden Ruf. Nach einigen Jahren nahm Zellweger seinen Neffen Otto Friedrich Krauss und James Zellweger als Partner des Bankhauses auf. Ulrich Zellweger setzte sich für randständige Kinder ein und sorgte dafür, dass sie eine gute Erziehung geniessen konnten. Er gründete 1849 ein Pflegelternhaus, das «Rebhaus» in Basel. Am Tag der Eröffnung zog das erste Hauselternpaar ein, und es traten viele junge Leute in das Institut ein, die für wenig Geld versorgt wurden. Zellweger unterstützte mehrere Zöglinge, indem er deren Kostgeld übernahm. Die jungen Menschen genossen eine vortreffliche Ausbildung und traten in angesehene Berufe wie Lehrer, Pfarrer oder Mediziner ein. Der religiös motivierte Philanthrop nahm sich auch den Kleinkindern an und gründete 1849 ein Kinderasyl und ein Waisenhaus. Die Zufluchtsstätte für die Kleinsten unter den Kleinen wurde 1852 noch mit einer Bildungsstätte für Kleinkindlehrerinnen verbunden. Auf Zellwegers Initiative geht auch die Gründung der Arbeitsschule Hüttschwendi in Trogen zurück. Durch die Mechanisierung des Webens geriet die Handweberei in eine Krise. Der Mangel an Bildung und Ausbildung der jungen Leute auf dem Land hatte unter anderem damit zu tun, dass die innovativen Kräfte fehlten. Zellweger gründete 1856 im Lindenbühl, in der ehemaligen Bierbrauerei seines Bruders Eduard, die er übernommen hatte, eine «Erziehungs- und Webeanstalt» mit einem landwirtschaftlichen Musterbetrieb. Die Anstalt diente dazu, Appenzellern aus ärmeren Verhältnissen eine gute Ausbildung als Weber zu garantieren. Zudem konnten sie die zur Anstalt gehörende Schule besuchen und Erfahrung in der Landwirtschaft sammeln. Zellweger war auch in anderen Bereichen der Selbsthilfe tätig. Er förderte beispielsweise die Bienenzucht und rationalisierte die Milch- und Forstwirtschaft. Ihm lag die Hebung des Forstwesens am Herzen. Mit einem geschulten Förster legte er Staatsschulen an. Auch die Qualität der Rinderzucht im Appenzellerland interessierte Ulrich Zellweger sehr. Er brachte kostbare Kühe und Rinder in den Kanton, die zur Verbesserung der Appenzeller Rasse beitragen sollten. Zudem führte er die Fabrikation von Emmentaler Käse ein, indem er eine eigene Sennerei mit Emmentaler Sennen finanzierte. Ferner unternahm er einen erneuten Versuch, die Seidenraupenzucht im Appenzellerland einzuführen, nachdem die Appenzellische Gemeinnützige Gesellschaft in den 1830er Jahren damit bereits Erfahrungen gesammelt hatte. Zur Erhaltung der Heimweberei unterstützte er die Einführung verbesserter Zettelei und Schlichterei für Handwebstühle. In der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts wurde das Umlegen, eine Technik beim Weben, durch die Einführung von Zettelmaschinen mechanisiert. Beim Schlichten werden Bürsten in eine Leimbrühe getaucht und damit die Fäden befeuchtet. Ulrich Zellweger unterstützte die Ausbildung von Krankenpflegerinnen in Trogen. Seine Frau Cécile Ryhiner unterstützte nach seinem Tod den Bau des Bezirksspitals in der Nideren, des späteren Krankenheims (heute Palais Bleu). Auch für das katholische Appenzell Innerrhoden hatte der Wohltäter ein warmes Herz; er spendete in verdienstlosen Jahren grosse Summen. Nachdem Zellweger 1859 die Basler Missions-Handlungsgesellschaft gegründet hatte, hob er 1862 das «Appenzeller Sonntagsblatt» aus der Traufe. Es fand schnell eine weite Verbreitung. Das Wochenblatt wurde weit über den Tod von Zellweger hinaus bis 1972 weitergeführt. Sohn Otto Zellweger und dessen Frau Lily Zellweger-Steiger übernahmen die Redaktion und druckten das Blatt in der Folge in Basel. 1866 ging die Gründung der Privatbank «Bank für Appenzell A.Rh.» vonstatten. Zuerst sollte daraus eine Staatsbank werden, um den Abfluss von appenzellischem Geld aus der Textilproduktion auf ausserkantonale Banken zu stoppen. Doch der grosse Rat verweigerte dem erfahrenen Unternehmer und Bankier die Gründung einer Staatsbank. So entstand eine Privatbank für Appenzell Ausserrhoden. Ulrich Zellweger war Initiant und erster Präsident dieser Bank, die 1909 mit dem Schweizerischen Bankverein fusionierte. Die letzten Jahre seines Lebens machte sich Zellweger grosse Sorgen um seine Bank in Paris. Denn der Deutsch-Französische Krieg war 1870 ausgebrochen und Paris wurde belagert. Von seinem Krankenbett aus pflegte er einen regen Briefwechsel mit seiner Bank in Paris, um Verluste zu vermeiden. Die Vorgänge in Frankreich erschütterten Zellweger sehr, und es ging ihm sehr nahe. Der Ausgang des Krieges erlebte er jedoch nicht mehr. Basler Mission Im Jahre 1858 wurde Ulrich Zellweger in die Basler Mission eingeladen. Die ehrenamtliche Tätigkeit war für den gläubigen Mann eine grosse Ehre. Er schätzte es, zum Komitee zu gehören, das Entwicklungshilfe für Bedürftige anbot sowie sich für die Überwindung der Sklaverei, für die Schaffung von Handelsstationen und Förderung der einheimischen Baumwollkultur in Afrika einsetzte. Den Basler Missionaren ging es nebst dem Verkünden des christlichen Glaubens auch um Entwicklungszusammenarbeit. Durch die Förderung der lokalen Industrie sollte die wirtschaftliche Position der Einheimischen gestärkt werden. Ein Vertrieb europäischer Waren und der Eintausch gegen Landesprodukte durch die Missionare war vorerst nicht vorgesehen. Es stellte sich jedoch heraus, dass viele Güter des täglichen Gebrauchs nur aus Europa beschafft werden konnten. Das heisst, es kamen Geld- und Postverkehr sowie Tätigkeiten im Zusammenhang mit dem Aufenthalt und der Rückreise der Missionare dazu. Ulrich Zellweger war Gründer der Missions-Handlungs-Gesellschaft, welche die praktischen Aufgaben übernahm. Die Missionare konnten sich somit voll und ganz dem Missionieren widmen und waren befreit von praktischen Aufgaben. Die Missionsstationen entwickelten sich zu kleinen Shops, in denen sich Einheimische wie Europäer eindeckten. Es wurde immer mehr gehandelt, woraus sich eine immer grössere Diskrepanz zwischen Mission und Handel ergab. Zellweger übernahm die Aufgabe, dieses Problem zu lösen. Er merkte schnell, dass der Handel im Rahmen der Basler Mission auch gute Chancen für Schweizer Unternehmen bot. Er wollte deshalb die kaufmännischen Tätigkeiten von der eigentlichen Missionsarbeit trennen, um eine langfristige Finanzierung der Basler Mission sicherzustellen. Als Präsident der Handlungs-Gesellschaft setzte er durch, dass sich nicht nur christlich Engagierte, sondern auch ökonomisch denkende Kaufleute beteiligen konnten. Über die Aktiengesellschaft der Missionshandlung wurde fortan gewinnorientiert gearbeitet. Den Gewinn sollten zur Hälfte die Aktionäre erhalten. Die andere Hälfte ging an die Basler Mission. Das Ziel Ulrich Zellwegers war, dass mit den Gewinnen des privaten Unternehmens «Missions-Handlungs-Gesellschaft» die Infrastrukturmassnahmen in den Missionsgebieten finanziert werden konnten. Nicht alle Personen im Komitee der Basler Mission waren von der Stossrichtung überzeugt, dass Entwicklungshilfe durch Marktwirtschaft zu leisten war. Als es im Jahre 1864 zu Spannungen kam, trat Zellweger als Präsident zurück und schied aus dem Komitee aus. Privatleben 1837 heiratete Ulrich Zellweger Elisabetha Potts aus Norfolk (Virginia). Sie war Witwe und brachte fünf Kinder aus erster Ehe mit. Nach nur fünf Jahren trennte sich das Paar wieder: Elisabetha habe sich nur um die Kinder gekümmert und Ulrich sei nur seinen Geschäften nachgegangen. 1842 kam Zellweger nach Trogen zurück, und seine Ehe wurde 1848 durch das Urteil des appenzellischen Gerichts geschieden. 1850 lernte er die Baslerin Cécile Ryhiner kennen und lieben. Sie war die Tochter von Christoph Ryhiner, dem Inhaber der Floretspinnerei «Ryhiner & Söhne», in Basel. Am 18. April 1850 heirateten Ulrich und Cécile. Aus dieser Ehe gingen sieben Kinder hervor. Sieben Jahre verbrachte die Familie in Paris, bevor sie nach Basel zog. Zellweger tätigte von der Schweiz aus die wichtigsten Geschäfte seiner Bank «Zellweger & Cie.». Am Ende von Zellwegers Leben kämpften die Söhne Walter und Wilhelm mit Tuberkulose. Trotz Kuraufenthalten in Nizza und Cannes starben die beiden. Der Deutsch-Französische Krieg 1870 und die Belagerung von Paris bereiteten dem vorsehungsgläubigen Unternehmer grosse Sorgen. Er pflegte einen ausgedehnten Briefwechsel mit seiner Bank in Paris. Zur gleichen Zeit war er körperlich erkrankt und an sein Bett gefesselt. Sechzehn Wochen verbrachte er in seinem Krankenlager. Bis kurz vor seinem Tod am 1. Januar 1871 diktierte er Antworten auf die Briefe in Paris, um Verluste zu vermeiden. Er behielt die volle Kraft und Klarheit seines Geistes bis zu seinem Tod, der ein sanftes Einschlafen war. Doch das Ende des Krieges erlebte er nicht mehr. Für Ulrich Zellweger hatten seine guten Taten nur einen Zweck: Gott zu dienen. Zu seiner Beerdigung in der Kirche Trogen kamen sehr viele Menschen, und das Grabmal von Ulrich Zellweger steht neben dem seines Bruders Salomon Zellweger auf dem Friedhof in Trogen. Auch wenn Ulrich Zellweger nicht immer in Trogen weilte, so hatte er dennoch sein Sommerhaus in seiner Heimatgemeinde, mit dem er zeit seines Lebens verbunden war. |
G;|Emil Wilhelm Tscheulin (* 26. Dezember 1884 in Teningen; † 17. Oktober 1951 ebenda) war ein deutscher Industrieller, Pionier der Aluminiumindustrie und NS-Wehrwirtschaftsführer.  Ausbildung und Betriebsleiter Emil Tscheulin war Sohn eines Formers in einer Eisengießerei und Maschinenfabrik. Nach dem Besuch der Volksschule von 1891 bis 1899 wurde er als Lehrling in diesem Betrieb eingestellt. Dort erhielt er eine Ausbildung als Maschinenbauer. Nachdem man seine technischen Fähigkeiten erkannt und gefördert hatte, erhielt er zusätzlich eine kaufmännische Schulung. Tscheulin leistete nach der Ausbildung Militärdienst und wurde danach als 22-Jähriger Betriebsleiter des Unternehmens, in dem er gelernt hatte. Nachdem die Maschinenfabrik die Lizenz zur Produktion von Blattaluminium vom Schweizer Aluminium-Industriellen Heinrich Alfred Gautschi erworben hatte, gründete sie 1910 gemeinsam mit dem Ludwigshafener Eisengroßhändler Wolf Netter & Sohn eine Aluminium GmbH und betraute Tscheulin mit der technischen Leitung. In einer Anlaufphase wurde das Herstellungsverfahren der Alufolie technisch verbessert. Bereits im Januar 1911 konnten die ersten Folien ausgeliefert werden. Gründer Die Aluminium GmbH wurde 1912 mit der Dr. Lauber, Neher & Cie. in Emmishofen und der Dr. Lauber, Neher Co. GmbH Singen zur Aluminium-Walzwerk AG (AWAG) mit Sitz in Schaffhausen unter der Leitung des Schweizers Robert Victor Neher fusioniert. Neher hatte bereits 1910 ein Patent zur Herstellung von endlosen Aluminiumfolienbändern entwickelt und produzierte nach diesem Verfahren seit 1912 auch am deutschen Standort Singen. Seine Produktionsweise war dem von Tscheulin angewandten Buchwalzverfahren technologisch weit überlegen. Da Tscheulin im neu formierten Unternehmen seinen Einfluss verloren hatte, gründete er 1913 mit seinem Schwager Wilhelm Ingold in Teningen ein eigenes Unternehmen mit der Bezeichnung Aluminium-Folien-Fabrik GmbH, in der er weiterhin nach dem Buchwalzverfahren Folie herstellte. Während des Ersten Weltkrieges war die Produktion in diesem Betrieb stark eingeschränkt, zeitweise wurde anstelle von Aluminium Zink zu Folie verarbeitet. Für kurze Zeit waren Tscheulin und Ingold auch als Soldaten zur Armee eingezogen worden. 1919 gründeten Emil Tscheulin, Wilhelm Ingold und die Eigentümer der Karlsruher Eisenwarenhandlung L. J. Ettlinger, Martin Elsas und Leopold Neumann, die Breisgau-Walzwerk GmbH, Teningen. Mit diesem Neuanfang war auch vom Paket- oder Buchwalzverfahren auf das Bandwalzverfahren umgestellt worden. 1926 erwarb die AWAG in Schaffhausen, zu der auch das Aluminiumwerk in Singen gehörte, die Anteile der L. J. Ettlinger am Breisgau-Walzwerk und die Singener Aluwerke unter der Leitung von Hans Constantin Paulssen übernahmen die Betriebsleitung. Tscheulin und Ingold schieden nach kurzer Zugehörigkeit aus dem umgebildeten Unternehmen aus und richteten in Deißlingen, damals Württemberg, ein neues Werk ein, da sie sich vertraglich verpflichtet hatten, sich für drei Jahre nicht mehr in Baden anzusiedeln. In dieser Zeit war Tscheulin auch in den USA und in Kanada, wo er nicht nur den technologischen Stand der nordamerikanischen Aluminiumindustrie studierte, sondern auch Geschäftskontakte knüpfte, die in den 30er Jahren und auch beim Neuaufbau nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg von großer Bedeutung für seinen Betrieb waren. Die Zeit zwischen 1926 und 1929 wurde dazu genutzt, in Teningen ein völlig neues Werk zu bauen. Neuanfang 1929 1929 wurden die neuen Werkshallen in Teningen bezogen, in denen eine Schmelzerei sowie ein Bandwalzwerk eingerichtet waren. Gleichzeitig wurde zur Verwertung der Aluminiumabfälle eine Aluminiumpulver GmbH gegründet. Die Pulverfabrik wurde 1934 wieder verkauft. 1937 nahm Tscheulin die Produktion von Aluminium-Tuben auf, ab 1938 wurden plissierte Flaschenkapseln für Sekt- und Weinflaschen hergestellt. Die Hauptprodukte waren jedoch Alufolien zur Herstellung von Kondensatoren und für Verpackungen. Um letztere zu veredeln, wurden die Folien kaschiert, gefärbt und bedruckt. Dabei entstanden auch Sammelbilder aus bunter Aluminiumfolie, die Zigarettenpackungen beigelegt wurden. Tscheulin produzierte die Zigaretten in einer damals eigens von ihm gegründeten Zigarettenfabrik. Die Bilder konnten in ein Sammelalbum mit dem Titel „Deutsche Märchen in Wort und Bild“ eingeklebt werden, das von Tscheulin herausgegeben worden war. Eine Kuriosität war auch die Herstellung von Notgeld während der Inflation 1923, bei dem anstelle von Papier Aluminiumfolie bedruckt wurde. Neben den Aluminium-Walzwerken Singen war Tscheulin der einzige Produzent derartiger Geldscheine. Von 1930 bis zum Kriegsbeginn wirkte Tscheulin unermüdlich auf die industrielle Entwicklung im Breisgau hin. So übernahm er 1931 die Hälfte des Kapitals der Maschinenfabrik, in der er gelernt hatte und rettete sie damit vor der Insolvenz. 1932 verlegte unter Vermittlung Tscheulins eine Frankfurter Kondensatorenfabrik ihren Firmensitz nach Teningen, weil hier für die Herstellung von Aluminium-Elektrolyt-Kondensatoren wegen der geringen Transportkosten für die Alufolie und der technologischen Zusammenarbeit erhebliche Kostenvorteile erzielt werden konnten. Im Juni 1933 stelle Tscheulin einen Antrag zum Bau eines Rohaluminiumwerkes beim Reichswirtschaftsministerium. Die Ansiedlung von Betrieben, die für die Rüstung von Bedeutung waren, wurde von Berlin bereits 1933 nicht mehr erlaubt, wenn diese in Grenznähe lagen. Der Antrag von Tscheulin, der eine Million RM investieren wollte, wurde nicht genehmigt. Industrieller von 1939 bis 1945 Von 1939 bis 1945 durften Aluminiumfolien nur noch für kriegswichtige Zwecke hergestellt werden. Emil Tscheulin bekam reichlich Aufträge und produzierte während des Krieges 60 Prozent der Kondensatorenfolien des Reiches. Dies war nur deshalb möglich, weil sein Unternehmen Zwangsarbeiter aus verschiedenen Staaten beschäftigte. So arbeiteten im Aluminiumwerk neben 99 Franzosen (darunter 42 Elsässer) auch 62 Weißrussen und 30 Ukrainer sowie Angehörige weiterer Nationen. Tscheulin unterhielt auch ein Lager, in dem die Zwangsarbeiter untergebracht waren. 1944 waren unter den ca. 800 Beschäftigten von Tscheulin 375 Zwangsarbeiter. Vergleicht man den Anteil von Zwangsarbeitern im Aluminiumwerk mit dem anderer Betrieben, etwa mit der Rüstungsschmiede Daimler-Benz in Mannheim, der 1944 bei 31,2 % lag, wird deutlich, dass das Aluminiumwerk in erheblichen Umfang Zwangsarbeiter für seinen Betrieb angefordert hatte. Weil ausschließlich für deutsche Beschäftigte, insbesondere für Frauen, Schutzbestimmungen etwa bezüglich der wöchentlichen Arbeitszeit sowie der Nachtarbeit bestanden, wurden die Firmen von den Arbeitsämtern aufgefordert, für die Nachtschichten Ostarbeiterinnen einzusetzen. Üblicherweise wurde den Firmen erlaubt, die Zwangsarbeiterinnen mit 62,75 Stunden die Woche zu beschäftigen. Tscheulin beantragte, seine Ostarbeiterinnen 72 Stunden in der Produktion einsetzen zu dürfen. Der Antrag wurde bewilligt. Von 1945 bis 1948 war das Werk stillgelegt. Die Produktionsanlagen wurden demontiert und die Betriebsgebäude weitgehend in eine französische Kaserne umgenutzt. 1949 konnte Tscheulin die ersten Tuben aus Aluminium ausliefern, 1950 gingen die ersten Walzstraßen in Betrieb. 1951 nahmen wenige Wochen vor dem Tod von Emil Tscheulin eine neue Schmelzerei sowie ein Block- und Bandwalzwerk ihre Arbeit auf. Das von Tscheulin gegründete Werk produziert noch heute bedruckte Folien, gehörte bis 2010 zum kanadischen Aluminiumhersteller Rio Tinto Alcan (RTA) und wurde zwischenzeitlich vom australischen Verpackungsspezialisten Amcor Flexibles übernommen. Politische Tätigkeit Emil Tscheulin gehörte zu den frühen und einflussreichsten Förderern des Nationalsozialismus in Baden, setzte sich seit 1930 für die NSDAP ein, in die er selbst aber erst 1932 als Mitglied beitrat. Er unterstützte die badische NSDAP mit namhaften Geldbeträgen. 1932 wurde er auch Leiter der Fachgruppe Leichtmetallwaren in der Industrie- und Handelskammer (IHK) Freiburg. Neben Wilhelm Keppler in Eberbach, Eduard Max Hofweber von der Heinrich Lanz AG und Fritz Reuther von Bopp & Reuther, beide in Mannheim, war er einer der wenigen Industriellen in Baden, die sich vor 1933 öffentlich zum Nationalsozialismus bekannten. Tscheulins Rolle beim Aufbau der NSDAP in Teningen Tscheulin war die treibende Kraft beim Aufbau der NSDAP-Ortsgruppe Teningen. Über seine Förderung des Nationalsozialismus in Teningen wurde ab 1938 im Amtsblatt der Gemeinde ausführlich berichtet, weshalb das Wirken Tscheulins besonders gut dokumentiert ist. So warb er 1930 einen in seinem Unternehmen beschäftigten Werkmeister für die NSDAP, nachdem dieser sich bereits ein Jahr zuvor in einer Regionalzeitung für Tscheulin und gegen den sozialdemokratischen Gemeinderat Fritz Schieler starkgemacht hatte. Tscheulin schlug seinen Werkmeister als NSDAP-Ortsgruppenleiter der neu zu gründenden Ortsgruppe vor. Im gleichen Jahr gründete der Werkmeister auch die SA Emmendingen, in der er als Sturmbannführer der SA Karriere machte. Ausdruck von Tscheulins Förderung der NSDAP-Ortsgruppe war die Tatsache, dass von den ersten 67 Parteigenossen im Ort 42 im Aluminiumwerk beschäftigt waren. Auch trug Tscheulin die Kosten der Parteiarbeit, gewährte dem bei ihm angestellten Ortsgruppenleiter bezahlten Urlaub für sein Engagement für die NSDAP und verpflichtete sich diesem gegenüber 1932, für alle Kosten aufzukommen, die bei Saalschlachten der Sturmabteilung entstehen sollten, allerdings unter der Bedingung, dass die Teninger SA Sieger bleibe. Im Amtsblatt der Gemeinde wurde rückblickend berichtet, dass das Tscheulinwerk schon im Frühjahr 1932 eine „nationalsozialistische Hochburg“ war und „im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes eine Festung, aus welcher die SA ihre Ausfälle machte“. Im Aluminiumwerk wurden „die Waffen der SA untergebracht, die Akten sichergestellt und keine Polizei getraute sich dem Werk etwas anzuhaben“. Weiter wurden im Aluminiumwerk Spitzen für die Sturmfahnen gefertigt und Totschläger aus Aluminium gegossen. Emil Tscheulin hat selbst Schusswaffen beschafft, die er an Parteigenossen weitergab, obwohl der SA wie der SS der Besitz von Schusswaffen streng verboten war. Auch hat er persönlich auf Seiten der SA in deren Schlägereien mit sozialdemokratischen Aktivisten des Reichsbanners eingegriffen. NSBO Eine wesentliche Rolle beim Aufbau nationalsozialistischer Strukturen in Teningen spielte die Gründung von Nationalsozialistischen Betriebszellenorganisationen NSBO. Diese Aktion war in Teningen besonders erfolgreich, was dadurch belegt wird, dass bis Februar 1932, also ein Jahr vor Hitlers „Machtergreifung“, 650 NSBO-Mitglieder geworben werden konnten. Im Betrieb von Emil Tscheulin waren schon Ende 1931 mit wenigen Ausnahmen alle Betriebsangehörigen Mitglieder der NSBO. Mit den NSBO versuchten die Nationalsozialisten ab 1931, den Einfluss von Gewerkschaften und Sozialdemokraten in den Betrieben auszuschalten, ein Ziel, das Tscheulin in seinem Werk erfolgreich durchsetzte. Im Amtsblatt der Gemeinde war darüber im August 1939 rückblickend zu lesen, dass in Teningen 1932 die „verhältnismäßig größte Betriebszellenorganisation im Gau Baden“ bestand. NSDAP-Prominenz zu Besuch Kennzeichnend für die enge und frühe Verbindung zwischen Tscheulin und der NSDAP ist auch die NSDAP-Parteiprominenz, die teilweise schon vor 1933 in der Kantine des Aluminiumwerks in Teningen empfangen wurde: Ernst Röhm, der Oberste SA-Führer. Robert Wagner, Gauleiter von Baden. Walter Köhler, SA-Führer und Ministerpräsident von Baden 1933 bis 1945. Karl Pflaumer, Badischer Innenminister 1933 bis 1945 und SS-Brigadeführer. Hanns Elard Ludin, Führer des SA-Gau-Sturms Baden. Josef Wasmer, Führer der SA-Brigade 54. Dietrich von Jagow, SA-Obergruppenführer. Präsident der IHK Freiburg Nach der „Machtergreifung“ der NSDAP wurde Tscheulin Präsident der Industrie- und Handelskammer (IHK) Freiburg, die jedoch nicht mehr selbständig, sondern dem Führerprinzip entsprechend der IHK Baden unterstellt war. Dieses Amt hatte er bis 1945 inne. Von 1940 bis 1943 war er auch Präsident der IHK Mülhausen und Kolmar, die nach der Annexion des Elsass gleichgeschaltet worden waren. Unter den Wirtschaftsführern Badens hatte Tscheulin mit die besten Kontakte zum NSDAP-Gauleiter Robert Wagner, der ab 1940 auch Chef der Zivilverwaltung im besetzten Elsass war. Als Präsident der IHK hatte Tscheulin auch die Kontakte zwischen Industrie und Wissenschaft, hier besonders zur Universität Freiburg, zu unterhalten. Dabei hat die IHK auf seine Initiative hin zur Unterstützung des Chemikers und späteren Nobelpreisträgers Hermann Staudinger 1939 eine Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Celluloseforschung gegründet, die von Staudinger geleitet wurde und die diesem die Möglichkeit bot, an der Universität eine Forschungsabteilung für makromolekulare Chemie zu etablieren. Staudinger, gegen den 1933 unter anderem wegen kritischer Äußerungen im Zusammenhang mit dem Ersten Weltkrieg ein Untersuchungsverfahren der Gestapo mit dem Ziel seiner Vertreibung von der Universität eingeleitet worden war, hatte eine gleichgerichtete Initiative beim Reichserziehungsminister Bernhard Rust eingereicht, die von diesem im Jahr 1938 abgelehnt worden war. In anderen Fällen schreckte Tscheulin aber auch nicht davor zurück, ihm nicht genehme Persönlichkeiten anzugreifen und ihnen seine Unterstützung zu entziehen, ohne dass hierzu finanzielle oder fachliche Gründe vorlagen. Tscheulin hatte eine Abneigung gegen den dem Widerstand verbundenen Ökonomen Adolf Lampe, der zusammen mit Walter Eucken das „Oberbadische Wirtschaftsinstitut“ betrieb, das bis dahin eng mit der IHK zusammenarbeitete und auch vom Reichswirtschaftsministerium gefördert wurde. Tscheulin verweigerte dem Institut seine Unterstützung und dieses blieb nur erhalten, weil es von der Universität übernommen wurde. Tscheulin kam als Präsident der IHK auch bei der „Arisierung“ jüdischer Unternehmen eine nicht zu unterschätzende Rolle zu. Die Industrie- und Handelskammern hatten bei den entsprechenden „Verfahren“ Gutachten zur Umsetzung der „Arisierung“ abzugeben und den Kaufvertrag sowie den Kaufpreis zu genehmigen. Tscheulin hatte dabei offenbar erheblichen Entscheidungsspielraum und nutzte diesen noch 1942 im Falle von Hans Mez, einem Freiburger Hersteller von Nähseide, dem vorgehalten wurde, er sei „Halbjude“. Tscheulin setzte sich gegen verschiedene Parteikreise für Mez ein, hatte dabei allerdings keinen Erfolg. Im Verfahren gegen das Metallwerk Oscar Weil G.m.b.H in Lahr dagegen kam er, möglicherweise aus privaten Interessen, zu einer anderen Entscheidung. Der heute noch bestehende Betrieb hatte damals 150 Mitarbeiter und war in Europa Marktführer bei Stahl- und Aluminiumwolle und ist unter anderem durch die Marke abrazo bekannt. Das Unternehmen hatte erhebliche rüstungs- und devisenpolitische Bedeutung. Da der jüdische Firmenchef Hugo Weil 1938 bei der Reichskanzlei einen Ausnahmeantrag gegen die drohende „Arisierung“ stellte, mit der Begründung, dass wegen seiner Auslandskontakte nicht auf seine Mitarbeit verzichtet werden könne, musste Tscheulin sein Gutachten abgeben. Tscheulin sprach sich gegen das Anliegen Weils aus und das Reichsinnenministerium lehnte dessen Ausnahmeantrag ab. Auch der Versuch, die Betriebsleitung an den künftigen „nicht-jüdischen“ Schwiegersohn Weils zu übertragen, scheiterte und das Unternehmen wechselte am 1. Dezember 1939 den Besitzer. Neuer Firmeninhaber wurde der Direktor des Aluminiumwerks Tscheulin, Clemens Kentrup, Günstling des Gauleiters Robert Wagner und dessen Gauwirtschaftsberater von 1933 bis 1945. Kentrup war Tscheulins Schwiegersohn und wurde wahrscheinlich von Tscheulin bei der Übernahme von Weils Unternehmen finanziell unterstützt. Bereits 1938 wurde Tscheulin zum Wehrwirtschaftsführer ernannt, also zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem ausschließlich verdiente Parteigenossen diesen Titel bekamen, der während des Krieges auch an parteiferne Industrieführern verliehen wurde. Wegen seiner aktiven Tätigkeit für das NS-Regime wurde Tscheulin zu 40 Monaten Internierungshaft und einer Geldstrafe von 5.000 Mark verurteilt; er verbüßte die Haft von 1945 bis 1947. Auch sein Schwager Wilhelm Ingold verbüßte eine mehrjährige Haftstrafe. Trotz seiner Linientreue kritisierte Tscheulin auch organisatorische Missstände, die sich durch Rivalitäten zwischen verschiedenen Parteigliederungen ergaben: „Das Nebeneinander, Übereinander und Durcheinander der verschiedenen Organisationsformen hat zum Teil solche Verwirrung hervorgerufen, dass selbst mit dem besten Willen ausgerüstete und klardenkende Menschen sich nicht mehr zurechtfinden können“. |
G;|Wang Guangyi (chinesisch 王广义, *1957, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China) ist ein zeitgenössischer, chinesischer Künstler. Er zählt zu den bekanntesten Vertretern der Bewegung zeitgenössischer chinesischer Kunst, die Ende der achtziger Jahre entstand. Er lebt und arbeitet in Peking.  Der 1957 in Heilongjiang geborene Wang Guangyi gilt als einer der bedeutendsten chinesischen Künstler der Gegenwart. Sohn eines Bahnarbeiters aus Nordchina, arbeitete er für drei Jahre in einem Dorf auf dem Land. Nach der Pensionierung des Vaters wurde auch Wang Guangyi Bahnarbeiter. Er hat dabei jedoch nie seinen Traum vom Besuch einer Hochschule aufgegeben. Nach mehreren erfolglosen Versuchen wurde er dann an der Kunstakademie Zhejiang aufgenommen, wo er Ölmalerei studierte. Dort machte er 1984 seinen Abschluss. . Wang Guangyi hat mit der Serie Great Criticism die Aufmerksamkeit der Kritik und des internationalen Marktes auf sich gezogen. Die Serie hat ihn zu einer Ikone der zeitgenössischen chinesischen Kunst gemacht. Wie viele chinesische Künstler seiner Generation ist sein Werk stark von seiner Jugend während der Kulturellen Revolution beeinflusst. Gemeinsam mit - etwa gleichaltrigen - Künstlern wie Yue Minjun, Zeng Fanzhi, Fang Lijun wird Zeng zu einer Kunstrichtung gezählt, die als politischer Pop bezeichnet wird. Das Werk Wang Guangyis wird fälschlicherweise zum „Political Pop“ („Politischer Pop“) zugerechnet. Ein wichtiges Thema seines Werks ist hingegen sein Verhältnis zur Transzendenz. Typisch für sein Werk ist die Verbindung von Propaganda-Kunst der Kulturrevolution mit Pop Art-Ästhetik. Am bekanntesten ist dabei seine Serie Great Criticism bei der er Logos westlicher Markenprodukte wie Coca Cola, Gucci, Rolex oder Chanel mit Szenen aus Propagandaplakaten kombiniert. Hauptwerke und Hauptserien The Back of Humanity (1985) und Frozen North Pole (1984-85) Die Arbeiten zur Serie Frozen North Pole verwenden ziemlich kalte und trostlose Zeichen. Sie sind durch einfache Formen und weiche Pinselstriche gekennzeichnet, um eine winterliche Welt darzustellen, die dem Künstler, der als junger Mann in Nordchina lebte, ziemlich vertraut ist. Der Nordpol wird in diesen Gemälden nicht im Hinblick auf seine geografischen Merkmale betrachtet, sondern als symbolischer Ort, wo ein neuer Glauben entsteht, in dem der Einzelne sich vor allem auf sich selbst bezieht, ohne sich aber deshalb von der Gesellschaft loszulösen. In den Jahren in denen diese Gemälde entstanden wurden in China Glaube und Zukunft vom Kommunismus verkörpert. Aber anstatt die Thesen des dialektischen Materialismus zu übernehmen, entschied die Gruppe junger Künstler aus dem Norden, zu der auch Wang Guangyi gehörte, sich mit den Texten der westlichen Philosophie auseinanderzusetzen. Post Classical (1986-1988) Der von Wang Guangyi und ihm nahestehenden Künstlern entwickelte Begriff des Glaubens hat eine gewisse Affinität zu der klassischen westlichen Kunst gefunden. Die Serie Post Classical ist aus der synthetischen Revision der Meisterwerke der westlichen Kunst, die mit den Themen von Religion, Moral, Glaube und Ideologie verbunden sind, entstanden. Diese Gemälde verwenden verschiedene Grautöne und vereinigen die menschliche Figur und ihre Umwelt ohne viele Details. Das Ziel von Wang Guangyi war es, einen Stil zu entwickeln, der sich von der klassischen Kunst unterscheidet; mit dieser Strategie drückt er die Konzepte und persönliche Sichtweisen aus, die er aus der Lektüre von Gombrich entwickelt hat. Great Criticism (1990-2007) Diese Werke verwenden Propagandabilder der Kulturrevolution und Logos zeitgenössischer Marken, die aus der westlichen Werbung stammen. Wang Guangyi hat diese Serie seit 1990 hergestellt aber im Jahr 2007 beendet. Er war überzeugt, dass der internationale Markterfolg der Serie ihren ursprünglichen Sinn, der darin besteht, dass politische Propaganda und Werbung zwei Formen der Gehirnwäsche sind, gefährden könnte. VISA (1994) Die Installation bezieht sich auf die Kontrollmechanismen, die Regierungen verschiedener Länder verwenden, um die Bewegungen der Individuen durch Personalausweise und Reisepässe zu kontrollieren. In dieser Installation hat Wang Guangyi Holzkisten benutzt die er sehr ordentlich aufeinander stapelte; die dem Zuschauer zugewandten Seite zeigt das Bild vom Gesicht eines Kindes, das in einem Krankenhaus fotografiert wurde. Die Bilder sind rot und grün abgetönt. Auf den Bildern hat Wang Guangyi mit Siebdruck seinen Vor- und Nachname, Geschlecht und Datum, an dem diese Arbeiten konzipiert wurden, den 2. Januar 1994 festgehalten (irrtümlicherweise wurde mehrfach geschrieben, dass es sich dabei um das Geburtsdatum der Künstler handelte). Auf einigen Kisten erscheint auch die Telefonnummer, die der Künstler damals benutzte; auf andere Kisten ist das Wort „VISA“ gedruckt. Passport (1994-1995), VISA (1995-1998) und Virus Carriers (1996-1998) In diesen Serien von Gemälden sind die Begriffe „VISA“, „Passport“ und „Virus Carriers“ auf Bilder von Neugeborenen, Erwachsenen und Hunden auf gestempelt; die Aufschriften werden durch Informationen zu Name, Geburtsort, -datum und Geschlecht der Subjekte begleitet. Indem die Werke auf die bürokratischen Verfahren verweisen, die mit dem Reisen von einem Land in ein anderes verbunden sind, verraten sie wie sich der Staat schützt indem er die potenzielle Gefahr von Individuen auslotet. In der Serie Virus Carriers zeigt ein Gemälde das Bild eines Hundes, das von Angaben, die eine Art Tierausweis darstellen, begleitet wird; das Tier ist hier als ein gefährlicher Virusträger gekennzeichnet. VISA, Passport und Virus Carriers reflektiert den gesellschaftlichen Gebrauch von Angst als System zu Kontrolle, die Gefahren und Bedrohungen überschattet. Wang Guangyi fühlt noch ein ausgeprägtes, tief verwurzeltes Klima des gegenseitigen Verdachts und der drohenden Gefahr. Dieses Klima, das während des Kalten Kriegs entstand, ist heute immer noch präsent, obwohl sie den Aspekt der Zwangsindoktrinierung verloren hat. Die Wang Guangyis reflektiert damit über das Verhältnis der Macht zum Einzelnen. Die Macht behält die Kontrolle über das Individuum, indem sie die kollektiven Ängste schürt, um sich dann als Bollwerk gegen die unbekannten Gefahren, die wehrlose Personen plötzlich bedrohen, anzubieten. Nach Vorstellung des Künstlers entsteht durch diese Formen von psychischen Druck eine stillschweigende Übereinkunft zwischen der Macht und dem Individuum, die eine Art Schutz vor einer Ansteckung mit neuen Viren verspricht und als Gegenleistung einen Verzicht eines Teils der persönlichen Freiheit einfordert.  Quarantine – All Food is Potentially Poisonous (1996) und 24-hour Food Degeneration Process (1997) Um Quarantine-All Foods are Potentially Poisonous anzufertigen, hat Guangyi den kleinen Supermarkt seines Viertels in einem Ausstellungsraum rekonstruiert. Hier standen auf den Regalen, neben den üblichen Produkten des Supermarkts, zwanzig aus einer Quarantänestation entnommene Propagandaplakate über die Gefahren von mangelnder Hygiene. Im Angesicht dieser Gegenüberstellung ist der Zuschauer gezwungen, über Unsicherheiten und Ängste nachzudenken, von der er dachte, dass sie mit dem Ende des Kalten Kriegs verschwunden seien. Interessant zu bemerken ist, dass im feuchten Klima Südchinas, dass Gemüse einfach verfault. Aus Kartoffeln, Zwiebeln und anderen Knollen spießen hingegen neue Wurzeln und Triebe, die den Objekten eine neue Art der Erscheinung geben. Man könnte sagen, dass dieser Prozess eine neue Form von Schönheit schafft, die so die Angst vor der Fäulnis von Nahrungsmitteln verdrängt. Mit 24-hour Food Degeneration Process zeigt der Künstler, dass alle Nahrungsmittel eine sogenannte „shelf life“ oder „Haltbarkeit“ von nur etwa 24 Stunden haben. Wenn ein Nahrungsmittel länger aufbewahrt wird, fängt man an es „frisch“ zu nennen. Mit fortschreitender Zeit verändert sich sein Zustand und damit auch die Art wie man es nennt. Die Installation besteht aus zehn kleinen Plakaten und vier kleinen unversiegelten Behältern voll mit Plastiktüten, Flaschen, Einmachgefäßen, Obst und Gemüse. Mit der Zeit beginnen die Nahrungsmittel allmählich zu verfaulen und unangenehm faulig zu riechen. Da sich die Besucher darüber bescherten wurde im Lauf der Ausstellung Obst und Gemüse mehrmals ausgewechselt wodurch jedoch der langsame Zersetzungsprozess, der eines der Merkmale der Arbeit war, unterbrochen wurde.   Basic Education (2001) Basic Education ist eine Installation, die eine Baustelle während der Jahre des Kalten Kriegs wieder erschafft. Die Rekonstruktion verwendet Schaufeln, Baugerüste, Arbeitskleidung und Propagandaplakate. Die Wahrhaftigkeit der Szene erregt die Befürchtung, dass man ein psychologisches Klima wieder erlebt, das man glaubte, endgültig überwunden zu haben. Materialist series (2001-2005) Materialist ist eine Serie von Skulpturen, die zwölf aus Propagandaplakaten entnommene Bilder von Arbeitern, Bauern und Soldaten aufgreift. Nach Wang Guangyi heben diese propagandistischen Bilder hervor, dass  die hauptsächliche Kraft des Volkes und die Wut, die es mit seinen Bewegungen zum Ausdruck bringt, ihren Ursprung in seinen Glaube an die Ideologie hat. Mit diesen Skulpturen will der Künstler den Ausdruck des allgemeinen Gefühls der Leute visualisieren. Mit Referenz zum dialektischen Materialismus, hat das Wort „Materialist“ eine besondere Bedeutung in der Geschichte Chinas, weil es in einem Wort die sozialistische Ideologie zusammenfasst. Die chinesische Geschichte betont, dass die Chinesen „vollkommene Materialisten“ sind und dass „die vollkommenen Materialisten vor nichts Angst haben; sie können die Welt erobern und das Schicksal der Leute unserer Nation verändern “. Der Künstler sieht jedoch zugleich auch eine andere Bedeutungsebene in seinem Werk. In der Kunst werden die Dinge, die eine bestimmte konzeptuelle Eigenschaft haben, als „das Objekt“ bezeichnet. Dieser Begriff hat im Chinesischen denselben Wortstamm wie „Materialist“. Wang Guangyi erklärt: „Es gibt in diesem Fall einen linguistischen Zusammenhang mit den Materialisten. Ich will den Begriff Materialist verwenden, um so eine Doppeldeutigkeit zu erreichen, die das Publikum dazu bringt, eine doppelte kulturelle Verbindung herzustellen“. Monument to Laborers (2001) Das ursprüngliche Projekt von Monument to Laborers wollte an Ort und Stelle zwanzig Betonplatten herstellen. In die sollten die Namen der Musterarbeiter und der Arbeiter, die in den letzten zwanzig Jahren in der chinesischen Stadt Shenzhen verletzten oder ums Leben gekommenen waren, eingraviert werden. Der Künstler wollte dann die Betonplatten mit Plexiglas abdecken, um jeder Platte die Bedeutung eines alternativen Monuments zu geben. Die endgültige Präsentation der Installation reproduzierte jedoch die monumentalen Skulpturen – The Materialist. Er hat diese in Glasvitrinen untergebracht und damit das Gefühl einer visuellen Distanz und Entfremdung von diesen an sich äußerst vertrauten Formen geschaffen. Das Publikum ist aufgefordert, die Bedeutung der Worte „Arbeit“ und „Arbeiter“ in einem konsumorientierten Kontext zu überdenken.  Cold War Aesthetic (2007-2008) Wang Guangyi ist überzeugt, dass die internationale politische Lage immer noch von den ideologischen und politischen Konflikten der Vergangenheit zwischen den USA, der Sowjetunion und China beeinflusst ist. Im Jahr 2007 hat der Künstler eine Serie von Werken geschaffen mit denen er die psychologischen Wirkung, die von der Propaganda in den Jahren des Kalten Kriegs ausgegangen ist, untersucht. Cold War Aesthetic besteht aus einer Videoinstallation, Skulpturen und Propagandaplakaten aus den siebziger Jahren. Dazu kommen Gemälde inspiriert von den Propagandaplakaten und von illustrierten Handbüchern, die die chinesische Regierung verfasste, um die Bevölkerung über das richtige Verhalten im Falle eines Atomangriffs zu informieren. Die gesamte Szenerie bezieht sich auf die Programme der nationalen Verteidigung, die in den sechziger Jahren die Bevölkerung darüber aufklärte, wie man sich im Fall eines Gas-, Atom- und Bakterienkriegs schützt; sie ruft die Erinnerung an Übungen wieder wach, an denen der Künstler selbst als Kind teilnahm. Durch die Rekonstruktion von Augenblicken einer vergangenen Zeit fordert die Installation den Zuschauer auf, sich mit der Realität jener Jahre auseinanderzusetzen. Sie zielt darauf ab ihm das Klima und die Geisteshaltung, die den Kalten Kriegs charakterisiert haben, wieder erleben zu lassen. Wang Guangyi fordert den Zuschauer auf, sich eine eigene Meinung über Ereignisse zu bilden, die aus der jüngsten Vergangenheit immer noch die Gegenwart beeinflussen. Temperature (2010-2011) Temperature ist eine Installation aus 1920 Thermometern, die in 48 Gruppen aufgeteilten sind. Die Thermometer sind als Metapher für ein Geräte zur Messung der „Temperatur“ von verschiedenen Regionen der Welt zu verstehen. Die Installation will nicht die Temperatur im wörtlichen Sinne messen, sondern das politische Klima, die Spannungen und Entspannungen, wie sie die örtlichen Bevölkerungen im Kontext ihres politischen und gesellschaftlichen Lebens erfahren.  New Religion (2011) New Religion ist eine Serie von Ölgemälden, deren Sujets die großen politischen Führer (Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong), die spirituellen Führer (Christus), die spirituellen und politischen Führer zugleich (Papst Johannes XXIII.) oder Philosophen, deren Denkweise immer noch Einfluss ausübt (Marx und Engels), sind. Es scheint, als habe Wang Guangyi die Bilder aus Negativen entnommen. Obwohl der Künstler in diesen Werken die traditionelle Maltechnik von Öl auf Leinwand anwendet, bricht die Ambiguität, die den Bezug auf das fotografische Medium erschafft, die Vertrautheit, die der Zuschauer mit ihnen hat und öffnet neue Überlegungen über ihre Bedeutung. Denselben störenden Einfluss üben die, auf einige Leinwände abgestempelten Nummern und das Abtropfen von Farben aus. Durch diese Serie von Werken hat sich Wang Guangyi gefragt, was die großen Utopien  miteinander verbindet, worin der Reiz besteht, den sie auf den Mensch ausüben und weshalb alle Menschen Figuren brauchen auf die sie ihren Glaube projizieren. Sacred Object (2012) Sacred Object besteht aus 600 Schichten Wachstuch, die sich auf dem Fußboden häufen und ein Parallelepiped (10 x 1,20 x 0,8 m) bilden. Das Wachstuch verweist auf die Pergamente, auf denen man in der Antike schrieb, aber auch auf die Wachstafel, in die man ebenfalls in der antiken Welt mit dem Griffel ritzte. Die Idee Wachstücher in Schichten übereinanderzulegen verweist auf ein Sedimentieren des Wissens, das sich im Laufe der Zeit durch Schreiben anhäuft. Die aufgeschichteten Blätter werden zu Landkarten der Welt, die, indem sie sich wieder mischen, eine fruchtbare Vermischung entstehen lassen. Diese verweist wiederum auf einen metaphysischen Horizont, in dem das Heilige ein Ort zum Dialog und Vergleich darstellt und nicht zum Konflikt. Things-In-Themselves (2012) Things-In-Themselves ist eine Installation aus Jutesäcken voll Reis, die um die Außengrenzen des trichterförmigen Ausstellungsraums aufgestapelt sind. Die Installation geht zurück auf eine Erinnerung Wang Guangyis, der in seiner Jugend während der Jahre auf der Kunsthochschule, zeitweise in einem Getreidespeicher gearbeitet hat. Die Things-In-Themselves zugrunde liegenden Eindrücke aus der Jugend werden durch die Tatsache überwunden, dass in den Getreidespeichern die Getreidesäcke nicht so aufgestapelt sind, wie es in dieser Installation geschieht. In der Ausstellung, die für eine Installation im Today Art Museum im Jahr 2012 entstandenen ist, lassen die Säcke ihren Inhalt nicht erkennen. Der kann jedoch durch den Geruch erahnt werden Mit Things-In-Themselves kreiert Wang Guangyi Form und Bild von etwas Unerkennbarem, das jenseits der Erfahrung liegt; er bezieht sich folglich auf  das was Kant „Noumenon“, „Ding an sich“ nennt. |
G;|Francesc „Cesc“ Fàbregas i Soler [fɾənˈsɛsk ˈfaβɾəɣəs suˈle] (* 4. Mai 1987 in Arenys de Mar) ist ein spanischer Fußballspieler. Er begann seine Karriere in der Jugendabteilung des FC Barcelona und wechselte im Juni 2003 zum FC Arsenal in die englische Premier League, bei dem er trotz seiner Jugend zum Führungsspieler aufstieg und sich zur zentralen Schaltstelle im Spiel der Mannschaft entwickelte. 2006 erhielt er von Arsenal einen Achtjahresvertrag. Im August 2011 kehrte Fàbregas zum FC Barcelona zurück; seit Juli 2014 steht er beim FC Chelsea unter Vertrag. Fàbregas erreichte im Jahr 2003 mit der spanischen U-17-Nationalmannschaft das Finale der U-17-Weltmeisterschaft in Finnland, bei der er zum „Spieler des Turniers“ gewählt und bester Torschütze wurde. Bei der WM 2006 in Deutschland gehörte er dem Kader der spanischen Nationalmannschaft an, mit der er in den Jahren 2008 und 2012 Europameister, im Jahr 2010 Weltmeister wurde.   Verein Fàbregas begann seine Vereinsfußballkarriere beim FC Barcelona. Dort nahm er in der Jugend häufig die „Volante“-Position ein, wie die Rolle des freien, meist defensiven Mittelfeldspielers im spanisch- und portugiesischsprachigen Raum genannt wird. Dennoch war er zu dieser Zeit bereits sehr torgefährlich und erzielte gelegentlich mehr als 30 Tore innerhalb einer Saison. In der ersten Mannschaft des FC Barcelona kam er aber nicht zu einem Einsatz. Da ihm die Perspektive in Barcelona beschränkt erschien, entschied er sich für einen Wechsel nach London zum FC Arsenal, bei dem er am 11. September 2003 einen Vertrag unterschrieb. Nach ersten Eingewöhnungsschwierigkeiten in der britischen Hauptstadt half vor allem die neue Freundschaft mit seinem Mannschaftskameraden Philippe Senderos bei der Akklimatisierung in der ungewohnten Umgebung. Der erst 16 Jahre alte Fàbregas orientierte sich sportlich in erster Linie an Patrick Vieira und Gilberto Silva. Früher als erwartet absolvierte er am 28. Oktober 2003 in einem Ligapokalheimspiel gegen Rotherham United sein Debüt. Damit war er mit 16 Jahren und 177 Tagen Arsenals bis dahin jüngster Spieler in der ersten Mannschaft. Nachdem er dort im Elfmeterschießen bereits ein Tor erzielt hatte, markierte er im gleichen Wettbewerb beim 5:1-Sieg gegen die Wolverhampton Wanderers seinen ersten Treffer im laufenden Spiel, und war damit auch der jüngste Torschütze des Vereins in einem Pflichtspiel. Ein Ligaspiel absolvierte Fàbregas in der Saison 2003/04 noch nicht; der FC Arsenal, der in der gesamten Meisterschaftsrunde ohne Niederlage geblieben war, wurde zum Saisonende englischer Meister. Erst in der Spielzeit 2004/05 stand der Spanier erstmals außerhalb des Ligapokals in der Mannschaft. Er agierte zunächst in der Community-Shield-Partie gegen Manchester United und aufgrund einer Verletzung Vieiras auch in den ersten vier Premier-League-Partien, die er nach Ansicht der Presse mit guten Leistungen bestritt. Seinen Einstand gab er in der englischen Meisterschaft am 15. August 2004 im Spiel gegen den FC Everton. Zehn Tage später erzielte er ein Tor beim 3:0-Sieg gegen die Blackburn Rovers und war damit jüngster Ligatorschütze des FC Arsenal. Die verletzungsbedingten Ausfälle von Edu und Gilberto Silva sorgten für weitere Einsätze des Teenagers. Sein erstes Tor in einem internationalen Wettbewerb schoss er am 7. Dezember 2004 in der Champions League beim 5:1-Sieg gegen Rosenborg Trondheim. Am Ende der Spielzeit stand er im FA-Cup-Finale gegen Manchester United in der Stammformation und gewann dort nach torlosen 120 Minuten im Elfmeterschießen. Nach dem Weggang Vieiras zu Juventus Turin wurde Fàbregas an der Seite von Gilberto Silva endgültig Stammspieler im zentralen Mittelfeld des FC Arsenal. Mit der Trikotnummer 4, die von Vieira getragen worden war, absolvierte er in der Saison 2005/06 49 Partien. Trotz seines jungen Alters nahm seine Bedeutung in der Profimannschaft des FC Arsenal zu. Da er im Vergleich zu Vieira eine deutlich geringere physische Präsenz ausstrahlte und einen kleineren Bereich des Mittelfelds abdeckte, bestanden anfangs Zweifel, ob er die Lücke, die Vieira hinterlassen hatte, schließen könne. Dessen ungeachtet entwickelte Fàbregas seine eigene Spielweise und erhielt vor allem durch seine Champions-League-Auftritte gegen Real Madrid und Juventus Turin große Anerkennung. In Partie gegen Juventus erzielte er den ersten Treffer des FC Arsenal, bereitete das zweite Tor von Thierry Henry vor und trat dabei Vorurteilen entgegen, dass er aufgrund seiner schmächtigen Ausstrahlung gegen körperbetont spielende Mittelfeldgegner schnell seiner Stärken beraubt werden könnte. Fàbregas stand anschließend auch im Champions-League-Finale gegen seinen ehemaligen Verein FC Barcelona, verlor dort aber mit 1:2 und beendete damit die Spielzeit ohne Titelgewinn. Der sportliche Durchbruch Fàbregas’ in der Vorsaison führte zu einer Reihe von Transferspekulationen im Sommer 2006. Vor allem die Vereinsführung von Real Madrid bekundete trotz des langfristigen Vertrags des jungen Spaniers beim FC Arsenal ihr Interesse an einer Verpflichtung. Arsène Wenger erklärte Fàbregas daraufhin für unverkäuflich und bot ihm im September 2006 eine Erweiterung des noch sechs Jahre gültigen Kontrakts um zwei weitere Jahre an, die Fàbregas mit seiner Unterschrift am 19. Oktober 2006 akzeptierte. Als Grund für dieses langfristige Engagement gab er die technisch orientierte Spielweise des FC Arsenal und die Zusammenarbeit mit Trainer Wenger an. Die Saison 2006/07 stellte einen Entwicklungsprozess des jungen Arsenal-Kaders dar, in dessen Mitte Fàbregas stand. Die Mannschaft erreichte gegen den Stadtrivalen FC Chelsea das Endspiel im Ligapokal, verlor dort mit 1:2 und gewann wie im Jahr zuvor keinen bedeutenden Titel. Fàbregas galt dennoch als eine der Schlüsselfiguren in der Mannschaft und kam in allen Ligapartien zum Einsatz. Die Champions-League-Saison eröffnete er mit zwei Toren zum 3:0-Hinspielsieg in der dritten Qualifikationsrunde bei Dinamo Zagreb; mit insgesamt 13 Vorlagen erreichte er den zweitbesten Wert eines Spielers in der Premier-League-Saison 2006/07. In dieser Zeit erhielt Fàbregas zahlreiche individuelle Ehrungen, darunter nach einer Wahl führender europäischer Sportjournalisten den „Golden-Boy-Award“ der italienischen Sportzeitung Tuttosport und die Nominierung für die UEFA-Mannschaft des Jahres 2006. In England war er im Januar 2007 der Spieler des Monats und auch für die Wahl zu Englands Fußballer des Jahres wurde er von seinen Spielerkollegen nominiert – die Entscheidung für den „PFA Players' Player of the Year“ fiel dabei letztlich – wie auch im Falle des besten Jungprofis („PFA Young Player of the Year“) – auf Cristiano Ronaldo von Manchester United. Im Juni 2007 wurde er mit 60 % der Stimmen zum besten Arsenal-Spieler der abgelaufenen Saison gewählt. Die Spielzeit 2007/08 begann mit großen Unsicherheiten für den FC Arsenal. Mit David Dein hatte ein Vizepräsident nach Streitigkeiten den Verein verlassen und der Weggang von Thierry Henry – dem bis dahin besten Torschützen das Vereins – zum FC Barcelona ließ auch Fragen nach der Zukunft Wengers entstehen. Fàbregas erkannte, dass sich sein Stellenwert in der Mannschaft erhöht hatte und bekannte öffentlich, dieser neuen Herausforderung offensiv begegnen zu wollen. Der Klub startete angesichts der Vorzeichen überraschend gut in die Saison; Fàbregas hatte an diesem Höhenflug an die Tabellenspitze mit seinen Toren und Vorlagen Anteil. Zwischen August und Oktober 2007 erhielt er vereinsintern dreimal in Serie die Auszeichnung zum besten Spieler des FC Arsenal und auch ligaweit folgte im September seine zweite Wahl zum Spieler des Monats in der Premier League. Jedoch verlief die Rückrunde für Arsenal und Fàbregas weniger erfolgreich. Zwar wurde das Champions-League-Viertelfinale erreicht, nachdem Arsenal den AC Mailand im Rückspiel im Giuseppe-Meazza-Stadion mit 2:0 besiegt hatte. Fàbregas hatte dabei einen Anteil durch seinen Treffer zum 1:0. Allerdings schied man im Viertelfinale gegen den FC Liverpool aus. Auch in der Premier League ging es bergab. Man musste am Ende der Saison Manchester United den Vortritt im Kampf um die Meisterschaft lassen und belegte den dritten Rang hinter Chelsea und vor Liverpool. Damit war noch die Qualifikation für die Champions League erreicht worden. Nach einem holprigen Start in die Folgesaison und der Kritik durch William Gallas, der bis dahin als Spielführer den FC Arsenal vertrat, wurde dieser abgesetzt und vom 21-jährigen Fábregas als Kapitän abgelöst. Einen Monat später zog sich Fàbregas eine Verletzung am Knie zu, wegen der er für vier Monate pausieren musste. Arsenal beendete die Saison auf dem vierten Platz der Tabelle und ohne Titel. Die Premier-League-Saison 2009/10 begann Arsenal mit einem 6:1-Auswärtssieg beim FC Everton, zu dem Fàbregas mit zwei Toren und zwei Vorlagen beitrug. Darauf folgten zwei Niederlagen gegen Manchester United und Manchester City. Anschließend blieb die Mannschaft für 13 Spiele ohne Niederlage und übernahm am 22. Spieltag die Tabellenführung. In der Champions League trafen die Londoner im Viertelfinale auf den FC Barcelona. Dort verwandelte Fàbregas im Hinspiel einen Elfmeter zum 2:2-Endstand. Dies war sein letztes Spiel in dieser Saison, da ihm Carles Puyol beim Foul, das den Elfmeter verursachte, eine Verletzung an der rechten Wade zugefügt hatte. Ohne Fàbregas schied der FC Arsenal gegen den FC Barcelona aus und rangierte in der Liga am Saisonende auf dem dritten Platz. Fàbregas, der in dieser Saison seinen persönlichen Bestwert von 15 Ligatoren erreicht hatte, wurde am Ende der Saison in das PFA Team of the Year gewählt. Vor der Saison 2010/11 bemühte sich der FC Barcelona, Fàbregas zurückzuholen; Arsenal lehnte jedoch ab. Den Saisonstart 2010/11 verpasste Fàbregas verletzungsbedingt, insgesamt bestritt er in dieser Spielzeit 25 Ligaspiele. Auch diese Saison endete für Arsenal titellos, dabei war die Mannschaft in allen vier Wettbewerben bis Februar 2011 mit Titelchancen vertreten. Doch innerhalb von zwei Wochen verlor der Verein das League-Cup-Finale, schied im FA-Cup-Viertelfinale und im Champions-League-Achtelfinale aus. In der Liga war man bis zum Jahreswechsel nur wenige Punkte hinter dem Tabellenführer, wurde am Ende aber Vierter. Am 15. August 2011 kehrte Fàbregas zum FC Barcelona zurück. Er unterschrieb einen Fünfjahresvertrag bei den Katalanen. Die Ablösesumme betrug 34 Millionen Euro und konnte erfolgsabhängig um weitere 5 Millionen Euro ansteigen. 5 Millionen Euro der Transferkosten übernahm Fàbregas selbst, indem er sich bereit erklärte, jährlich auf eine Million Euro seines Jahresgehaltes zu verzichten. In seinen ersten vier Ligaeinsätzen für den FC Barcelona in der Saison 2011/12 erzielte Fàbregas jeweils ein Tor. Mit dem FC Barcelona gewann er je einmal die Spanische Meisterschaft, die Supercopa de Espana, die Copa del Rey, den UEFA Supercup und den FIFA Weltpokal. Zur Saison 2014/15 wechselte Fàbregas zurück in die Premier League zum FC Chelsea; er unterschrieb einen bis zum 30. Juni 2019 laufenden Vertrag und trägt – wie bei Arsenal und in Barcelona – die Rückennummer 4. Nationalmannschaft Der aktuelle spanische Nationalspieler hatte seine internationale Karriere bereits im Jugendalter begonnen. Im Jahr 2003 war er bei der U-17-Weltmeisterschaft in Finnland als Mittelfeldspieler der beste Torschütze des Turniers. Zudem wurde er zum besten Spieler dieser Weltmeisterschaft gewählt, bei der sein Team das Finale erreichte und dort der brasilianischen Auswahl unterlag. Ein Jahr später nahm Fàbregas mit der U-17-Auswahl an der EM in Frankreich teil. Erneut zog er mit seiner Mannschaft ins Finale ein und wurde anschließend zum Spieler des Turniers gewählt. Nach seinem Aufstieg zu einem Schlüsselspieler des FC Arsenal ließ auch die erste Nominierung in die spanische A-Nationalmannschaft nicht lange auf sich warten. Vor allem die Champions-League-Auftritte überzeugten den spanischen Trainer Luis Aragonés, Fàbregas zu seinem ersten Länderspiel in der Freundschaftsbegegnung gegen die Elfenbeinküste am 1. März 2006 zu verhelfen. Damit war der Teenager der jüngste spanische Nationalspieler seit 70 Jahren und erhielt für seine Leistung beim 3:2-Sieg gute Kritiken. Zwei Monate später wurde Fàbregas am 15. Mai 2006 in den spanischen Kader für die WM 2006 in Deutschland berufen. Während des Turniers kam er in den beiden ersten Gruppenspielen jeweils als Einwechselspieler in der zweiten Halbzeit zum Einsatz und bereitete ein Tor zum 3:1-Sieg gegen Tunesien vor. An der Reihe anderer Reservespieler – darunter mit José Antonio Reyes auch sein Mannschaftskamerad vom FC Arsenal – lief er dann in der Startelf zum dritten Spiel gegen Saudi-Arabien auf. Auch im Achtelfinale stand Fàbregas anstelle von Marcos Senna in der Startformation. Die 1:3-Niederlage gegen Frankreich bedeutete dann aber bereits das Ende im Turnier. Mit seiner Einwechslung im ersten Spiel gegen die Ukraine (4:0) nach 77 Minuten für Luis García war Fàbregas mit 19 Jahren und 41 Tagen zum bis dahin jüngsten spanischen Nationalspieler bei einer Fußballweltmeisterschaft geworden und auch bei der Wahl zum besten Jungprofi des Turniers, die letztlich Lukas Podolski gewann, stand er auf der Nominierungsliste. Bei der Europameisterschaft 2008 in Österreich und der Schweiz gewann Fàbregas mit seiner Mannschaft den Titel. Dabei kam er zunächst nur zu Kurzeinsätzen. Dabei verwandelte unter anderem den entscheidenden Elfmeter im Viertelfinalspiel gegen Italien. Nach der Verletzung des Torjägers David Villa schenkte Trainer Luis Aragonés ihm das Vertrauen im Finale gegen Deutschland, in dem er von Beginn an spielte. Fàbregas wurde in das All-Star-Team des Turniers gewählt. Er wurde für die Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft 2010 in den Kader der spanischen Fußballnationalmannschaft berufen. Während der WM kam er dabei zu vier Einsätzen in sieben Spielen. Nachdem er in keinem Spiel Teil der Startformation gewesen war, leistete er im Finale gegen die Niederlande die Vorarbeit für den entscheidenden Treffer zum 1:0 durch Andrés Iniesta. Dieser Treffer in der Nachspielzeit markierte den Endstand und führte so letztendlich zum Titelgewinn der Spanier. Fàbregas wurde von Trainer Vicente del Bosque in den Kader der spanischen Nationalelf für die Europameisterschaft 2012 aufgenommen. Del Bosque ließ phasenweise mit einer 4-6-0-Formation spielen, also ohne echten Stürmer und nur mit sehr offensiven Mittelfeldspielern. In dieser Aufstellung nahm Fàbregas die Rolle einer Offensivkraft ein. Im ersten Spiel erzielte er der Treffer zum 1:1-Endstand gegen Italien. Im Gruppenspiel gegen Irland traf er erneut. Im Elfmeterschießen gegen Portugal (Halbfinale) verwandelte er den entscheidenden Strafstoß und im Endspiel bereitete er das 1:0 durch David Silva vor. Spanien verteidigte als erste Mannschaft ihren Europameistertitel. Darüber hinaus absolvierte Fàbregas einige inoffizielle Freundschaftsspiele mit der von FIFA und UEFA nicht anerkannten katalanischen Auswahl. Bei der Fußball-Europameisterschaft 2016 in Frankreich wurde er in das Aufgebot Spaniens aufgenommen. In allen Partien stand er in der Startelf und im dritten Gruppenspiel gegen Kroatien bereitete er die frühe 1:0-Führung vor. Da das Spiel noch 1:2 verloren wurde, musste das Team im Achtelfinale gegen Italien spielen, es verlor erneut und schied aus. |
G;|Alexander II. Nikolajewitsch (russisch Алекса́ндр II Никола́евич; * 17.jul./ 29. April 1818greg. in Moskau; † 1.jul./ 13. März 1881greg. in Sankt Petersburg) war 1855 bis 1881 Kaiser von Russland aus dem Haus Romanow-Holstein-Gottorp. Alexander II. ist unter dem schon zeitgenössisch gebrauchten Beinamen „Zar-Befreier“ (russisch Oswoboditel) in die Geschichte eingegangen. In seine Regierungszeit fallen die sog. „Großen Reformen“.  Kindheit und Erziehung Alexander II. wurde 1818 als Sohn des Kaisers Nikolaus I. und der Kaiserin Alexandra Fjodorowna geboren. Seine Thronfolge stand seit seinem achten Lebensjahr – anders als bei den meisten seiner Vorgänger auf dem russischen Thron seit Peter I. – nie in Zweifel. Entsprechend den Gepflogenheiten am russischen Hof war Alexander wie alle Großfürsten für eine Offizierslaufbahn bestimmt und wurde entsprechend ausgebildet. Für die Grundzüge der Erziehung war daher seit seinem siebten Lebensjahr ein Berufssoldat und Veteran aus den napoleonischen Kriegen verantwortlich, nämlich der deutschstämmige Linienoffizier Karl Merder. Merder, der zuvor als Lehrer in einem Kadettenkorps seine pädagogischen Fähigkeiten unter Beweis gestellt hatte, war über zehn Jahre fast beständig in der unmittelbaren Nähe Alexanders und begleitete ihn auch bei seinen Auslandsreisen. An die Seite Merders trat auf Wunsch der Kaiserin Wassili Schukowski. Der liberale Dichter und Vorleser der Kaiserin nahm dabei die Rolle eines Mentors und Tutors ein. Beide hauptverantwortlichen Erzieher achteten darauf, dass Alexander einerseits staatspolitisches Rüstzeug erlangte, andererseits aber auch eine entwickelte Persönlichkeit entfalten konnte. Als eigentliche Lehrer in den jeweiligen Fächern betrauten die Erzieher ausgezeichnete Wissenschaftler und zum Teil die wichtigsten zeitgenössischen russischen Politiker, wie zum Beispiel den leitenden Minister Alexanders I., Michael Speranski. Bemerkenswert dabei ist, dass wie im Falle Speranskis durchaus auch Männer mit der Ausbildung des Thronfolgers betraut wurden, die im Gegensatz zur extrem reaktionären Politik von Nikolaus I. standen. 1839 lernte Alexander II. seine spätere Frau, die Prinzessin Marie von Hessen und bei Rhein, kennen, die zu dem Zeitpunkt erst 15 Jahre alt war. Die Hochzeit fand am 4. Apriljul./ 16. April 1841greg. statt. Auch gegen den erheblichen Widerstand am Zarenhof und sogar diplomatische Interventionen hatte Alexander seine Wahl durchgesetzt. Unterstützung hatte er dabei erstaunlicherweise bei seinem in politischen Fragen despotischen Vater gefunden, der seinem Sohn in dieser Frage offensichtlich nicht im Weg stehen wollte, obgleich die Heirat als „politisch unzweckmäßig“ galt. Alexanders Charakter wird zwiespältig beurteilt: einerseits wird er als friedlich, weise und wohlwollend mit einem klaren Sinn für das Gute beschrieben, andererseits galt er aber auch seinen eigenen Erziehern als arrogant, wankelmütig, wenig tatkräftig und – wie er selbst später zugab – als bis zur Rachsucht nachtragend. Hinzu kam, dass ihm sein Vater die Grundzüge der autokratischen Herrschaftsauffassung in einer Art vermittelte, dass Alexander trotz aller libertären Tendenzen und Reformen unumstößlich an diesem Prinzip festhielt. Zudem entwickelte der Thronfolger aufgrund der strengen militärischen Ausbildung ein Faible für alles Militärische, woraus eine an Wilhelm II. erinnernde närrische Vorliebe für das militärische Zeremoniell erwuchs. Militärischen Sachverstand bildete Alexander II. jedoch nicht aus, wenngleich er sich dies sehr wohl einbildete. Allerdings hatte Alexander wie kaum ein Zweiter schon vor der Übernahme der Regierungsverantwortung tiefe Einblicke in die Regierungstätigkeit gewinnen können, repräsentative Aufgaben wahrgenommen, zahlreiche Reisen ins Ausland und in sämtliche russischen Provinzen unternommen, des Öfteren wichtige Regierungsaufgaben direkt wahrgenommen und im Jahre 1842 sogar für einen Monat die Regentschaft über das Reich während der Abwesenheit seines Vaters übernommen. Regentschaft Krimkrieg und Regierungsübernahme Als Alexander nach dem Tod seines Vaters am 18. Februarjul./ 2. März 1855greg. den Zarenthron bestieg, war er zwar mit knapp 37 Jahren ein gereifter, gut ausgebildeter und auch politisch versierter Mann, doch er musste das Reich in einer schweren Krise übernehmen, denn Russland befand sich im Krimkrieg, und auch wenn dieser unter Alexander zunächst unverändert fortgesetzt wurde, zeichnete sich die Niederlage schon im Frühjahr 1855 deutlich ab und wurde mit dem Fall Sewastopols unabwendbar. Der Kaiser besuchte im November selbst Odessa und die Krim und gelangte dabei endgültig zu der Erkenntnis, dass der Krieg verloren sei. Der Pariser Frieden vom 18. Märzjul./ 30. März 1856greg. beendete diesen Krieg. Er schwächte Russlands Machtstellung im Orient nur vorübergehend und bedeutete so kein Ende des russischen Interesses an den türkischen Territorien. Auch nach diesem Frieden wurde die Unterwerfung der kaukasischen Bergvölker fortgesetzt, während zugleich die weiten Gebiete zwischen dem Kaspischen Meer und dem Aralsee unter russischen Einfluss gebracht und zum Teil völlig okkupiert wurden. Hinsichtlich des Prestiges als Großmacht, die sich seit den Napoleonischen Kriegen und vor allem nach den 1848er Revolutionen selbst als Hegemonialmacht präsentierte, war es aber eine schwere – und, Günther Stökl zufolge, unnötige wie unwirksame – Demütigung Russlands, ihm die Entmilitarisierung der Schwarzmeerhäfen auferlegt zu haben. Hieraus erwuchs in Russland nach dem Überwinden eines ersten Schocks aufgrund der Kriegsniederlage eine religiös-nationale Stimmung, die nach Revanche trachtete. Für die Geschichte Russlands und vor allem die politischen Überzeugungen Alexanders II. waren Verlauf und Niederlage des Krimkrieges ein tiefer Einschnitt. Die Unfähigkeit, eine im Feindesland operierende und schlecht geführte Koalitionstruppe zu besiegen, zeigte Russlands Rückständigkeit in allen Bereichen, von der Wirtschaft über die Infrastruktur (Stichwort Eisenbahnen) und das Bildungswesen bis hin zur Heeresorganisation. Daher wurde der Krimkrieg zum Fanal für die russische Politik, denn Alexander II. nutzte den Pariser Frieden dazu, die Basis für sein politisches Programm eines Aufbrechens der verwobenen kulturellen, wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Fesseln durch den Impuls von außen zu schaffen. Alexander war bestrebt, Russland möglichst schnell eine Öffentlichkeit bzw. eine Gesellschaft zu geben, um so aus seiner Sicht im Konkurrenzkampf mit den anderen europäischen Großmächten bestehen zu können. Die „Großen Reformen“ Als Reaktion auf die in der Niederlage im Krimkrieg zutage getretene Rückständigkeit Russlands nahm Alexander weitreichende Reformen in Angriff, die in der wissenschaftlichen Literatur oft mit dem Attribut „groß“ beschrieben werden. Diese Reformen stellen einen der bedeutendsten Einschnitte in der Geschichte Russlands dar, Hoetsch sieht in ihnen sogar ein bedeutenderes Reformwerk als das Peters des Großen. Für Grünwald stehen die Reformen „an den Wurzeln der Revolution“. Kernstück der Reformen war die Bauernbefreiung: bereits zwölf Tage nach der Unterzeichnung des Pariser Friedens sagte der Kaiser vor Moskauer Adeligen, „es sei besser, die Leibeigenschaft abzuschaffen, als darauf zu warten, dass sie zerbreche.“ Zwar mögen dabei auch humanitäre Erwägungen eine Rolle gespielt haben, entscheidender war aber, dass die Leibeigenschaft als in wirtschaftlicher Hinsicht objektiv obsolet angesehen wurde. Eigentliches Ziel der Reformtätigkeit war es, Russland wirtschaftlich, technisch und somit letztlich militärisch in Europa wieder konkurrenzfähig zu machen. So wundert es nicht, dass die seit 1861 durchgeführte Aufhebung der Leibeigenschaft mit weiteren Reformen, unter anderem einer neuen Militärorganisation, verknüpft war. Alexander setzte diese Reformen gegen große Widerstände durch. Unterstützung fand er neben seinem Bruder Konstantin vor allem in der durchaus reformfreudigen Bürokratie. Da die Widerstände des grund- und leibeigenenbesitzenden Adels aber gewaltig waren, kam letztlich ein „verwässerter“ Kompromiss zustande. Anders als bei den Bauernbefreiungen in Preußen und Österreich, bei denen die Bauern kein Land erhalten hatten und so Kapitalausstattung und anschließend Investitionsfreude der Großgrundbesitzer gefördert worden war, wurden die russischen Bauern mit einem dauernden Nutzrecht von Haus und Hof ausgestattet, i.d.R. in dem Maße, wie sie zuvor die Felder bewirtschaftet hatten. Allerdings blieben die Fron- und Zinslasten gegenüber dem Grundherren bestehen, und es blieb auch bei der Anbindung an den Mir, eine Freizügigkeit bestand also nicht. Die Adeligen erhielten sogar das Recht, die Bauern vor Inkrafttreten noch umzusetzen, um ihr Gutsland nach eigenem Ermessen zu arrondieren. Zwar gab es einen „Minimalsatz“, eine Fläche Land, die das Existenzminimum sichern sollte, aber die Übervorteilung der Bauern bei den Ausführungsbestimmungen und den Ablösezahlungen war überdeutlich. Bei der Festlegung der Flächen gab es etwa sehr zum Nachteil der Bauern große regionale Unterschiede. Die Bauern mussten das Land käuflich erwerben, der Staat die Finanzierung dieser Geschäfte übernehmen. Eine Befreiung der Bauern aus der Polizeigewalt der Gutsbesitzers erfolgte unmittelbar mit dem Inkrafttreten der Reform 1861; weil das Land aber im Kollektivbesitz der örtlichen Bauern blieb und die schon bislang übliche periodische Umverteilung des Bodens festgeschrieben wurde, blieben die Möglichkeiten der Bauern, selbstbestimmt zu wirtschaften, höchst begrenzt. Alexander versuchte dabei durchaus Adel und Bauern gerecht zu werden, aber wegen der – wenngleich unzureichenden – Zuteilung von Land an die Bauern und der Zwangsbewirtschaftung in der Dorfgemeinschaft wurden die Produktionsfaktoren Arbeit sowie Grund und Boden nur unzureichend liberalisiert. Daher kam es weder zu bedeutenden Kapitalisierungseffekten im Adel noch zur Entstehung großer Massen verarmter Landloser, die wie etwa in Preußen in die Städte geflohen wären und dort einer Protoindustrie als Proletariat zur Verfügung gestanden hätten. Die Bevölkerungsentwicklung in Russland sorgte zudem für eine Zuspitzung der Lage, da 1911 – also 50 Jahre nach der Bauernbefreiung – bereits eine Verdopplung zu verzeichnen war. Dass auch ein Großteil der russischen Adeligen innerhalb kurzer Zeit ruiniert waren, weil sie nicht in der Lage waren, sich an die neuen wirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen anzupassen, zeigt, wie zwiespältig die Reform zu bewerten ist. Einerseits war sie beispielsweise der Sklavenbefreiung in den USA drei Jahre voraus, andererseits war und blieb Russland bis in die 1920er-Jahre ein Agrarstaat. Auch einem – wenn auch kleinen – Teil der Juden des Zarenreichs kamen diese Reformen nach langer Zeit der Repression und Beschränkungen zugute. Um die russische Wirtschaft zu fördern, wurde sowohl jüdischen Kaufleuten mit mehr als 50.000 Rubel Einkommen als auch Juden mit „bevorzugten“ Berufen (z. B. Techniker und Mechaniker) ein Wohnrecht auch außerhalb des im Westen des Reichs gelegenen Ansiedlungsrayons gewährt. Ein Freizügigkeitsrecht erhielten auch Juden mit akademischen Graden. (Diese Bestimmungen wurden von seinem Sohn und Nachfolger Alexander III. wieder weitgehend rückgängig gemacht.) Kriege und Revolten 1863 wurde der polnische Januaraufstand mit schonungsloser Härte niedergeschlagen. Die große Bedeutung der Reformen und die völlige Umgestaltung der wirtschaftlichen Verhältnisse, die sie zur Folge hatten, riefen in vielen Bevölkerungsgruppen Ablehnung hervor. Im Zuge dieser Unzufriedenheit und als Folge der immer noch bestehenden großen Ungleichheit in der Gesellschaft breiteten sich sozialistische, kommunistische und nihilistische Ideen aus und gewannen an Bedeutung. Gleichzeitig stärkte der Sieg über Polen nationalistische Gefühle und führte zum Erstarken des Panslawismus. Alexander machte keine ernsthaften Versuche, die Korruption in der Bürokratie zu unterdrücken; vielmehr duldete er korrupte Beamte in seiner nächsten Umgebung in hohen Stellungen. Daher stieg die Unzufriedenheit im Volk gegen Alexanders Regierung weiter. Ein am 4. Apriljul./ 16. April 1866greg. von dem Revolutionär Dimitri Karakosow vor dem Sommergarten versuchtes Attentat auf den Kaiser, das durch den Bauern Kommissarow verhindert wurde, hatte eingehende Untersuchungen zur Folge, welche die Existenz zahlreicher politischer Geheimbünde aufdeckten. Dieses und ein zweites Attentat, das während der Pariser Weltausstellung des Jahres 1867 von dem Polen Berezewski versucht wurde, übten auf den Kaiser einen nachhaltigen Eindruck aus und ließen seine Neigung zu Reformen schwinden. Die Zensur wurde in alter Strenge wiederhergestellt und ein umfassendes polizeiliches Überwachungssystem eingerichtet. Während des Krieges zwischen Österreich und Preußen im Jahr 1866 bewahrte Alexander eine neutrale, aber preußenfreundliche Haltung. Auch während des Deutsch-Französischen Krieges 1870/71 lagen Alexanders Sympathien bei Deutschland, was er unter anderem durch Ordensverleihungen an die deutschen Heerführer und durch Ernennung des Kronprinzen Friedrich zum russischen Generalfeldmarschall zeigte. Alexander hinderte Österreich an der Einmischung in den Krieg, indem er die Besetzung Galiziens durch russische Truppen androhte, falls Österreich mobilmachen sollte. Infolge dieses Krieges stieg Alexanders Einfluss: Wilhelm I., der neue deutsche Kaiser, war nicht nur mit ihm verwandt, sondern ihm auch aus Dankbarkeit für seine Unterstützung verpflichtet, während Frankreich sich um sein Wohlwollen in einem eventuellen Revanchekrieg bemühte. Zu einer Krise kam es am 15. August 1879, als der russische Kaiser dem deutschen Kaiser den so genannten Ohrfeigenbrief zusandte. Alexander bewahrte aber seine deutschfreundliche Haltung. Russland schloss 1881 mit den Kaisern Wilhelm I. von Deutschland und Franz Joseph I. von Österreich in Berlin das Dreikaiserbündnis. Damit wurden die lange bestehenden Spannungen zwischen Russland und Österreich-Ungarn zunächst abgebaut und der Frieden in Europa vorübergehend gefestigt. Russland erklärte sich in einem etwaigen Konflikt zwischen Deutschland und Frankreich für neutral und erlangte dafür freie Hand im Osten. Der Feldzug nach Chiwa 1873 erweiterte Russlands Macht im Innern Asiens beträchtlich, hatte aber zunächst noch keinen Konflikt mit Großbritannien zur Folge. Vielmehr schien sich 1874 durch die Heirat der einzigen Tochter Alexanders, Maria, mit Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, sogar eine Annäherung zwischen Russland und Großbritannien anzubahnen. Im Mai absolvierte Alexander einen Staatsbesuch in Großbritannien. Im Sommer 1874 fand auf Initiative von Alexander eine internationale Konferenz in Brüssel statt, die eine Konvention zu den Gesetzen und Gebräuchen des Krieges verabschieden sollte. Die Deklaration von Brüssel trat jedoch mangels Ratifikationen nie in Kraft. Währenddessen reorganisierte er die Armee nach deutschem Muster. Noch ehe diese Reorganisation beendet war, wurde Alexander fast wider Willen durch die Ausbreitung des Panslawismus vor allem in Adels- und Beamtenkreisen zum Engagement Russlands auf dem Balkan gedrängt. Er duldete in der Balkankrise die Unterstützung Serbiens und Montenegros durch Freiwillige und Gelder, wurde selbst Pate für einen Sohn des serbischen Fürsten Milan III. und nahm öffentlich für die Christen im osmanischen Reich Stellung. Im April 1877 erklärte Russland im Gefolge des niedergeschlagenen bulgarischen Aprilaufstands dem Osmanischen Reich den Krieg. Alexander zog mit Gortschakow nach Bessarabien, folgte der vorrückenden Donauarmee durch Rumänien nach Bulgarien und schlug sein Hauptquartier in Gorny Studen auf, wo er auch während der militärischen Rückschläge blieb, die Russland im Juli bis September erlitt. Als mit dem Fall von Plewen wieder ein Erfolg erzielt wurde, kehrte er am 15. Dezember 1877 nach Sankt Petersburg zurück, wo er am 22. Dezember mit großem Jubel empfangen wurde. Auch nach dem Krieg blieb seine Lage inmitten der sich bekämpfenden Richtungen in Russland schwierig, besonders nach neuen Anschlägen von Nihilisten 1879. Auf Alexander selbst wurden mehrere Anschläge verübt: am 14. April 1879 schoss Alexander Konstantinowitsch Solowjow auf ihn; am 1. Dezember 1879 versuchten Nihilisten, bei Moskau den Eisenbahnzug, in dem Alexander fuhr, zu sprengen; am 17. Februar 1880 erfolgte ein weiteres Attentat im Winterpalais. Als Reaktion wurde die Überwachung und Verfolgung von Regimegegnern verschärft. Alexander plante auch weiterhin Reformen der Gesellschaft. |
G;|Wilhelm Heinrich Koopmann (* 4. September 1814 in Tönning; † 20. Mai 1871 in Hamberge) war ein lutherischer Bischof für Holstein und ab 1868 innerhalb der Evangelisch-Lutherischen Landeskirche Schleswig-Holstein.  Koopmann − Sohn des Schullehrers Christian Heinrich Koopmann − besuchte die Gelehrtenschule zu Husum unter Rektor Peter Friedrichsen. Dort befreundete er sich mit seinem Mitschüler Theodor Storm. Gut vorgebildet besuchte er ab 1834 die Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel (Christiana Albertina). Während seiner Studienzeit machte besonders Claus Harms auf ihn einen tiefen und bleibenden Eindruck. Koopmann bekannte sich ganz entschieden zur lutherischen Orthodoxie und vertrat den konfessionell lutherischen Standpunkt mit Hartnäckigkeit. Nach fünf Jahren Studium bestand er 1839 das theologische Amtsexamen mit sehr rühmlicher Auszeichnung. Danach trat er als Hauslehrer in die Dienste des damaligen Amtmanns auf Schloss Gottorf, Ludwig Nicolaus von Scheele, der 1855 bis 1857 Minister für Holstein und Lauenburg sowie Auswärtiges werden sollte. Nach nur kurzer Zeit im Dienste von Scheeles wurde er am 23. August 1840 zum Diaconus an der St. Jürgenkirche zu Heide gewählt. In dieser Zeit war er Klaus Groth ein Lehrer für Latein und Philosophie. Als erste Veröffentlichung Koopmanns erschien 1842 anonym die Schrift Der Grund- und Glaubensmangel des Buches „die Grund- und Glaubenslehren“ … Nachgewiesen von einem orthodoxen Prediger in Dithmarschen, die sich gegen seinen früheren Lehrer, Pastor Dr. Joachim Friedrich Clasen in Tönning richtete, der im Jahr zuvor Die christlichen Grund- und Glaubenslehren der Orthodoxen und Rationalisten oder der Blind- und Denkgläubigen in der evangelisch-protestantischen Kirche herausgegeben hatte. Daraus erwuchs eine Debatte mit Pastor Martin Harring in Sehestedt (dem Bruder von Harro Harring), der Koopmann in zwei Episteln entgegenhielt: Erster Brief an den s.[alvo] t.[itulo] orthodoxen Herrn Amtsbruder in Dithmarschen, enthaltend die biblische Lehre von der Nothwendigkeit der guten Werke zur Seligkeit (1842) und ein zweiter Brief im gleichen Jahr. Hierauf erwiderte Koopmann im folgenden Jahr mit Die Scheidewand zwischen Christenthum und Widerchristenthum, allgemein faßlich beschrieben. Als Vorwort ein Sendschreiben an Herrn Pastor Harring, worauf Harring noch im gleichen Jahr mit einem Sendwort antwortete, womit dieser Streit endete. Am 2. April 1845 wechselte Koopmann von der holsteinischen zur lauenburgischen Landeskirche, wo er Pastor an der Maria-Magdalenen-Kirche in Lauenburg an der Elbe wurde. Durch diese Personalentscheidung wurde der seit langem schwelende Gegensatz der Landeskirchen virulent. Gegen die Beseitigung des kirchlichen Einflusses in den lauenburgischen Schulen, wie durch das lauenburgische Schulgesetz in den Jahren der Erhebung geplant, eröffnete Koopmann eine Polemik mit seiner 1850 verfassten Schrift: Die grundrechtliche Confusion in Staat, Kirche und Schule, beleuchtet mit besonderer Rücksicht auf den neuen Schulgesetzentwurf für das Herzogthum Lauenburg. Darin erklärte er sich auch gegen die Schleswig-Holsteinische Erhebung. Der Superintendent der lauenburgischen Landeskirche, Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Catenhusen, unterstützte Koopmanns Haltung in der Schulfrage. Koopmanns Haltung machte ihn in Lauenburg weithin unbeliebt. Nach Ende der Erhebung wechselte Koopmann von der lauenburgischen zurück zur holsteinischen Landeskirche, wo er am 7. September 1854 das Pastorat an der Christianskirche in Ottensen antrat. Im Zuge der vom Ministerium für die Herzogtümer Holstein und Lauenburg zu Kopenhagen unter von Scheele betriebenen Reformen der lutherischen Kirchenverfassung im Herzogtum Holstein wurde aus der holsteinischen lutherischen Landeskirche in Anlehnung an die dänische Nomenklatur das Stift Holstein und der geistliche Leiter firmierte statt als Generalsuperintendent fortan als Bischof. Am 2. Mai 1855 wurde Koopmann erster Bischof für Holstein in der Nachfolge des Generalsuperintendenten Johannes Carl Julius Herzbruch. Koopmann nahm seinen Wohnsitz in Altona und amtierte an der St. Trinitatiskirche. Zu seinen Aufgaben gehörte 1857, nach Glückstadt zu reisen, um die dortige Schloss- und Garnisonsgemeinde aufzuheben. Für seine seit der Erhebung betriebene Evangelisationsarbeit war Koopmann dem Missionar der Religious Tract Society, James Craig, wohl gesinnt, der Holstein als unwissendes unmoralisches Land einschätzte. Der Altonaer Propst Ernst Adolf Lilie (1864–1891) monierte 1866 das „immer bedenklichere Verhältnis“ Koopmanns zu Craig, den er für einen methodistischen Sektierer hielt. Als Bischof war Koopmann bemüht verschiedene Reformen durchzuführen. Zunächst wollte er einen neuen Landeskatechismus entwickeln und einführen. Die beauftragten Pastor Hasselmann und Dr. Asmussen hatten keinen Entwurf vorgestellt, so dass Koopmann 1860 selbst einen lieferte: Der kleine Katechismus Lutheri durch Bibelsprüche und kurze Sätze erklärt. Dagegen erhob sich ein starker Kampf, besonders von Seiten der Lehrerschaft. Somit musste Koopmann das Projekt eines neuen Katechismus aufgeben. Auch sein Bemühen, das Cramersche Gesangbuch, das ihm zu rationalistisch schien, durch ein neues orthodoxes Gesangbuch zu ersetzen, trug am Ende keine Früchte. Während des Deutsch-Dänischen Krieges (Februar bis Oktober 1864) begrüßte Koopmann, als Teil des Altonaer Empfangskomitees, mit einer Ansprache Wilhelm I. von Preußen am 23. April 1864 auf seiner Rückreise von den Truppen in Holstein und Schleswig nach Berlin. Nachdem Koopmann sich 1850 gegen die Erhebung ausgesprochen hatte, erwarteten viele, dass er nach der Einnahme Holsteins für den Deutschen Bund nach Dänemark auswandern würde. Doch er blieb und die österreichische Interimsverwaltung (1864–1866) beließ ihn im Amt. Die preußische Kreuzzeitung hielt ihm seine frühere Loyalität zur holsteinisch-dänischen Regierung vor, wogegen Koopmann seinen Standpunkt verteidigte mit der Schrift: Meine Rechtfertigung gegenüber den Verdächtigungen der Kreuzzeitung in Betreff meiner Stellung zur Landessache. 1866 verlieh ihm die theologische Fakultät der Christiana Albertina den Doctor Theologiae honoris causa. 1866 verwandte sich Koopmann für den Verein für Innere Mission. Als lutherischer Orthodoxer mühte er sich um Rückdrängung des alten Rationalismus der Aufklärungstheologie, richtete sich aber zugleich gegen die Ausbreitung des neuen Rationalismus seiner Zeit, wie ihn der Deutsche Protestantenverein verbreitete. Koopmann veröffentlichte dazu Das evangelische Christenthum in seinem Verhältnisse zu der modernen Cultur: zugleich ein motivirter Protest gegen die Tendenzen des sogenannten deutschen Protestantenvereins, woraus sich ein Kampf entwickelte, der besonders mit Richard Adelbert Lipsius scharf geführt wurde. Im März 1867 empfing Wilhelm I. in Kiel Koopmann und dessen schleswigschen Kollegen Generalsuperintendent Bertel Petersen Godt, wobei beide um Schutz für die evangelisch-lutherische Kirche in den Herzogtümern baten. Wilhelm I. sicherte der evangelischen Kirche in den Herzogtümern, den Begriff lutherisch fortlassend, in ihrem väterlichen Glauben und Bekenntnisse den königlichen Schutz zu, so wie anderwärts in Preußen auch. Angesichts der in Altpreußen vor 1866 durchgeführten Preußischen Union von Lutheranern und Reformierten musste diese vage Formulierung die Furcht schüren, dass auch in Holstein eine Union oktroyiert werde. Der schon für 1866 in Kiel geplante Deutsche Evangelische Kirchentag, „der im Laufe der Zeit immer mehr ein Werkzeug unionistischer Bestrebungen geworden ist,“ fand wegen des Krieges dann erst im Jahr darauf statt. Johann Hinrich Wichern vom altpreußischen Evangelischen Oberkirchenrat (EOK) hatte Godt und Koopmann für die Mitarbeit im schleswig-holsteinischen Landes-Comité des Kirchentags gewonnen. „Der 14. «evangelische Kirchentag» machte die ersten offenkundigen Anstrengungen, auch dieses Land in die Unionsströmung hereinzuziehen.“ Der EOK hatte in einer Denkschrift seine eigenen Pläne veröffentlicht, sein Organ, die Neue evangelische Kirchenzeitung, entsprechend berichtet. Angekündigt wurden für den Kirchentag unter anderen folgende Vorträge zweier ehemaliger Mitglieder der theologischen Fakultät in Kiel, nämlich „In wie weit die evangelischen Sonderconfessionen in der Gegenwart zu ihrer Sicherung und gedeihlichen Entwickelung einer selbständigen kirchlichen Ausgestaltung bedürfen“ von Emil Herrmann, Kirchentagspräsident, Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, sowie „Die Rechtfertigung durch den Glauben an Christus in ihrer Bedeutung für christliche Erkenntniß und christliches Leben“ von Isaak Dorner, Mitglied des EOKs in Berlin. Kaum war die Nachricht von dem, was man in Kiel beabsichtigte, durch's Land gedrungen, als sich zuerst schon unterm 17. Juli die Geistlichen in und um Hadersleben vereinigten, folgende Erklärung abzugeben: Die unterzeichneten Geistlichen der lutherischen Kirche Schleswigs haben aus der Einladung zum Kirchentage in Kiel 1867 ersehen, daß dort folgende Frage zur Verhandlung kommen soll: „Wie weit bedürfen in der Gegenwart die evangel.[ischen] Sonderbekenntnisse zu ihrer Sicherung und gedeihlichen Wirksamkeit einer selbständigen Ausgestaltung?“ – Wenn auf Grund dieses also formulirten Thema's in Kiel solche Resolutionen gefaßt werden sollten, welche die Selbständigkeit unserer luther.[ischen] Kirche gefährden könnten, so fühlen wir uns, als auf die Invariata eidlich verpflichtete Diener der luth.[erischen] Kirche, in unserm Gewissen gedrungen zu erklären: 1) daß wir hier keine Sonderbekenntnisse haben, sondern die auf dem luther.[ischen] Bekenntnisse ruhende luth.[erische] Kirche; 2) daß wir uns für verpflichtet erachten, für die Selbständigkeit dieser unserer Kirche nach Kräften einzustehen, 3) daß unsere evangel.[isch]-lutherische Kirche ein unantastbares Recht auf eigene, ausschließlich luther.[ische] Kirchenverwaltung hat, ohne welche sie aufhören würde, eine lutherische Kirche zu sein. Daraufhin trafen sich etwa 40 bis 50 unionistisch gestimmte und unionsfreundliche Geistliche aus der Provinz am 25. Juli zu einer Konferenz in Neustadt in Holstein und verabschiedeten das Neustadter Programm, worin sie eine presbyterial-synodale Kirchenverfassung für die Landeskirche forderten. Beim Kirchentag in Kiel vom 3. bis 6. September kam es dann zum Schlagabtausch. Nach dem einleitenden Gottesdienst in der St. Nikolaikirche mit Predigt von Hauptpastor Andreas Detlef Jensen, der nach dem Ersten Brief des Paulus an die Korinther (1 Kor 3,9-15 LB) über den Frieden der Kirche sprach, hielt Herrmann seinen Vortrag. Direkt in Reaktion darauf erklärte Koopmann: „Wir stehen in einem lutherischen Gotteshause. Dort auf der Kanzel stand lange Jahre hindurch der gewaltige Mann, dessen lutherisches Zeugniß weithin zündete, Claus Harms. Gerade jetzt vor 50 Jahren erschienen seine kirchenhistorisch gewordenen Thesen. Wir feiern ihr Jubiläum. Auch das Jubiläum der 75. These feiere ich: «Als eine arme Magd möchte man die luther.[ische] Kirche jetzt durch eine Copulation reich machen. Vollzieht den Akt ja nicht über Luthers Gebein! Es wird lebendig davon und dann – Weh euch!» Lieben Brüder! Man kann durch Unterstellung unter eine unionistische Oberbehörde uns sehr wehe thun, aber ein Wehe wird man dadurch nicht auf uns bringen. Es fällt anderswo hin. Gott berathe uns. Amen!“ Weiter tadelte Koopmann an Herrmanns Vortrag die gesamte Anschauung von Sonderbekenntnissen, von denen eine lutherische Kirche nichts wisse und forderte für die lutherische Kirche Schleswig-Holsteins das Recht, durch eine lutherische Kirchenbehörde regiert zu werden. Am folgenden Morgen ging die Tagung um 9 Uhr mit Dorners Vortrag weiter. Sein Vortrag „fand bei den kirchlich Gesinnten eine günstigere Aufnahme und Beurtheilung, wie er ja auch nicht geradezu für die Union plaidirt.“ Doch fühlte Koopmann sich auch hier gedrungen, dagegen zu protestieren, dass die Lehre von der Rechtfertigung durch den Glauben an Christus als Grundlage und Prinzip für eine Einigung der reformatorischen Kirchen betrachtet werde. „Zur Einigung der Kirchen dient dieses Band nicht. Denn dies Kleinod soll und muß in seiner Reinheit bewahrt werden. Nun dürfen wir nicht vergessen, daß es aufs engste mit allen Dogmen der Heilslehre zusammenhängt.“ Beschlüsse und Resolutionen wurden auf dem Kirchentage selbst nicht gefasst, was ja auch nicht in seiner Kompetenz lag. Doch Wichern warb – ungeachtet der umstrittenen Unionsfrage – auf dem Kirchentag bei Koopmann sowie anderen führenden Geistlichen der Provinz wie Godt, Franz Volkmar Reinhard Hansen (Propst zu Schleswig), Jensen, Friedrich Mommsen, Klosterprediger Heinrich Rendtorff sen. (1814–1868), Bürgermeister Thomsen (Kiel), Ernst Friedrich Versmann (Propst zu Itzehoe) und Bernhard Weiß für die Innere Mission. Eine Einigung beider Hauptparteien in der Frage der Union oder auch nur ein Kompromiss kamen nicht zu Stande, jede Partei ging vielmehr ihren eigenen Weg weiter. Während die Mitglieder der Kieler theologischen Fakultät meist die Seite der Union einnahmen, hielten Koopmann und Godt mit der Mehrzahl der Geistlichen zur lutherischen Kirche. Koopmanns Einsatz zog viele auf die lutherische Seite. Auf einer Versammlung am Rande des Kirchentags erklärten 150 Geistliche der ganzen Provinz einmütig: „Man wolle gern mit den Gegnern zusammen gehen, wenn sie auf Grund folgender Sätze der Vereinigung beitreten wollten: 1) Wir wollen nicht unter den Oberkirchenrath; 2) wir haben eine evangelisch-lutherische Kirche; 3) wir wünschen bald ein lutherisches Landesconsistorium, welches in Betreff der Verfassung das Weitere zu veranlassen hat.“ Später aber vereinigte sich eine Anzahl Geistlicher und Laien, präsidiert von Jensen, die auch ohne Union möglichst viel des Neustadter Programms übernehmen wollten und entschieden: „Wir beschließen, falls nach dem 1. Oktober [1867] nicht ein Landesconsistorium eingesetzt und demselben der Auftrag ertheilt sein sollte, die Einleitung zur Einführung einer presbyterial-synodalen Verfassung zu treffen, im Laufe des October wieder zusammen zu kommen und weitere Schritte zur Erreichung dieses Zieles zu berathen.“ Hansen, Jensen und Versmann wollten es übernehmen, eine erneute Versammlung einzuberufen. Seit Oktober 1867 war bei der preußischen Regierung die Union für die Landeskirchen in den neu eroberten Provinzen Preußens vom Tisch. 1868 nahm Koopmann an der Allgemeinen Evangelisch-Lutherischen Konferenz (AELK) in Hannover teil, die zunächst als Reaktion auf die preußischen Annexionen von 1866 geplant, zur Abwehr einer Kirchenunion führende Lutheraner und Vertreter lutherischer Kirchenleitungen unter anderen aus den preußisch annektierten Frankfurt am Main, Hannover und Schleswig-Holstein zusammenbrachte, darunter Gottlieb Christoph Adolf von Harleß, Theodor Kliefoth, Christoph Ernst Luthardt und Gerhard Uhlhorn. Koopmann wurde ein eifriges Mitglied der AELK und eröffnete deren Tagung in Leipzig 1870 mit einer Festpredigt über den Brief an die Hebräer (Hebr 4,14 LB), die auch gedruckt wurde. Bei Zusammenführung der lutherischen Stifter Holstein und Schleswig 1868 zur Evangelisch-Lutherischen Landeskirche Schleswig-Holstein wurde Koopmann im bisherigen Amte übernommen. Koopmann besorgte mit Edgar Bauer, der in Altona einen Verlag betrieb, die Ausgabe der Kirchlichen Blätter (1870) sowie der Christlich-politischen Vierteljahrsschrift. Koopmann „starb 20. Mai 1871 im Hause des Pastors Kräh in Hamberge, wo er zu einer Kirchenvisitation eingetroffen war.“ Er wurde auf dem Friedhofe in Nordhastedt, wo seine Tochter Katharina mit dem Pastor verheiratet war, beerdigt. Koopmanns orthodoxes Wirken blieb in der benachbarten lauenburgischen Landeskirche in Erinnerung, so dass bei deren Aufgehen in der Landeskirche Schleswig-Holsteins der lauenburgische Synodalbeschluss zur Geltung kam, „wegen der zwischen der Schleswig-Holsteinischen und der Lauenburgischen Kirche bestehenden großen Verschiedenheit in Bezug auf die Handhabung der Lehrzucht sich einmüthig gegen den Eintritt der Lauenburgischen Kirchengemeinden in den Schleswig-Holsteinischen Synodalverband“ auszusprechen. So geschah es dann auch, die Kirchengemeinden, die bis 1878 zur lauenburgische Landeskirche gehörten, bildeten dann noch bis 1979 mit dem Sprengel Lauenburg einen eigenen Verband in der vereinten Landeskirche. Koopmann hatte sich vielfach mit Naturwissenschaften befasst und unter anderem eine Konchyliologische Sammlung (Muschelsammlung) angelegt. Nach Koopmanns Tod errichteten seine Freunde die Koopmann-Stiftung für orthodoxe Studierende der Theologie. |
G;|Friedrich Flick (* 10. Juli 1883 in Ernsdorf, heute zu Kreuztal; † 20. Juli 1972 in Konstanz) war ein deutscher Unternehmer. Zur Zeit des Zweiten Weltkrieges hielt sein Flick-Konzern umfangreiche Firmenbeteiligungen, besonders im Rüstungsbereich. Im Flick-Prozess wurde er als Kriegsverbrecher zu sieben Jahren Haft verurteilt. In der Nachkriegszeit begann sein Wiederaufstieg, wobei er zu einem der reichsten Männer der Bundesrepublik Deutschland wurde. Seine Söhne waren Otto-Ernst Flick, Rudolf Flick (1919–1941) und Friedrich Karl Flick. Der zweitgeborene Sohn Rudolf kam als Soldat am 28. Juni 1941, sechs Tage nach Beginn des Krieges gegen die Sowjetunion, ums Leben.  Bis zum Ersten Weltkrieg Friedrich Flick kam am 10. Juli 1883 als Sohn eines Landwirts und finanziell abgesicherten Grubenholzhändlers, der auch einige Anteile an Siegerländer Erzgruben hielt, in Ernsdorf (heute Ortsteil von Kreuztal, Kreis Siegen-Wittgenstein) zur Welt. Flick besuchte das Realgymnasium (das heutige Gymnasium „Am Löhrtor“) in Siegen, absolvierte eine Lehre zum Kaufmann bei der Bremerhütte im heutigen Siegener Stadtteil Geisweid, leistete seinen Wehrdienst ab und begann ein Studium an der Handelshochschule Köln. Seit seiner Jugend las Flick eifrig Unternehmensbilanzen. Flick war einer der ersten Studenten, die nicht nur ein Betriebswirtschaftsstudium, sondern auch ein Studium der Volkswirtschaft absolvierten. Einer seiner Lehrer war dort Eugen Schmalenbach, der „Entwickler“ der dynamischen Bilanztheorie. Seine erste Anstellung bekam er, nachdem er 1906 seinen Abschluss als Diplom-Kaufmann erhalten hatte, wieder bei der Bremer Hütte. Zum 1. Juli 1913 wechselte er dann in den Vorstand der Eisenindustrie zu Menden und Schwerte in Schwerte/Ruhr, einem kombinierten Werk mit Stahlerzeugung und Weiterverarbeitung. Bereits zum 31. März 1915 verließ er das Unternehmen auf eigenen Wunsch. Sein Aufstieg begann 1915 als Vorstandsmitglied bei der Charlottenhütte in Niederschelden, in die er sich mit der Zeit einkaufte. Dies finanzierte er durch Gewinne an Betrieben, die er überteuert als Vorstandsmitglied kaufte, nachdem er sich zuvor an ihnen beteiligt hatte, oder indem er privat Schrott aufkaufte und an seine eigene Firma weiterverkaufte. Im Ersten Weltkrieg mit seinem Rüstungsboom führte er den Betrieb zu großen wirtschaftlichen Erfolgen und wurde schließlich 1919 sein Generaldirektor. Weimarer Republik Der Versuch, sich einen Stand im Ruhrgebiet zu verschaffen, scheiterte zunächst an den dortigen Industriemagnaten. Allerdings konnte Flick verhindern, dass sich diese ihrerseits im Siegerland etablierten. Über Betriebsaufkäufe in Oberschlesien und Mitteldeutschland, die er dank der hohen Inflation durch günstige Kredite finanzierte, baute er sein Unternehmen aus. Als Friedrich Flick den Firmensitz im September 1923 nach Berlin verlegte, kaufte er in der Zeit der Inflation nicht wahllos Unternehmen auf, sondern baute zielstrebig das Kerngeschäft im Eisen- und Stahlgewerbe sowie in der Kohlebranche aus. Die Bismarckhütte, die Kattowitzer AG für Bergbau und der Eisenhüttenbetrieb, der wichtigste Kohleförderer der Region Oberschlesien, sowie die Oberschlesische Eisenindustrie AG waren weitere Meilensteine auf dem Weg zu einem der größten Stahlkonzerne Deutschlands. Das Engagement in Oberschlesien erwies sich jedoch als Fehlentscheidung, und Schulden häuften sich auf. In der Folge gerieten weitere Werke Flicks in erhebliche finanzielle Schwierigkeiten. Im Tausch gegen die verschuldeten mitteldeutschen und oberschlesischen Werke erlangte Flick 1926 von Hugo Stinnes Anteile, die ihm schließlich zur Mehrheitsbeteiligung in der neuen Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG verhalfen. Die Charlottenhütte blieb als Holding in Flicks persönlichen Besitz und übernahm 1929 die Aktienmehrheit der Maxhütte. 1931 erfolgte der Konzernaufbau der Unternehmen Maxhütte und Mitteldeutsche Stahlwerke in der Holdinggesellschaft Charlottenhütte AG, und er trennte sich von den Vereinigten Stahlwerken. Infolge dieser Maßnahmen, der Weltwirtschaftskrise und der hohen Verschuldung drohte Flick nach dem rasanten Aufstieg die Zahlungsunfähigkeit: Es gelang Flick, der Reichsregierung im Juli 1932 die Aktienmehrheit der Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks-AG, die die Mehrheit an den Vereinigten Stahlwerken hielt, zu einem mehr als dreifach überhöhten Verkehrswert zu verkaufen. Später erklärte Flick diesen sensationellen Verkauf mit dem Verweis darauf, dass die Reichsregierung habe verhindern wollen, dass er an die Franzosen verkaufe. Im Nürnberger Flick-Prozess sagte Flick jedoch über den Hintergrund der Affäre aus, er habe seit 1926 als geheimer Mittelsmann für das Deutsche Reich versucht, die Kontrolle über die oberschlesischen Bergbaugesellschaften aufrechtzuerhalten, die im Versailler Vertrag größtenteils an Polen gefallen waren. Daher, so folgerte George W. F. Hallgarten, sei Flicks Drohung mit dem Verkauf nach Frankreich eine Art politischer Erpressung gewesen. Damit war Flick saniert. Dieses Geschäft, die Gelsenberg-Affäre, wurde in der Presse nicht nur wegen des Börsengeschäfts ein Skandal, sondern auch wegen der Wahlkampfspenden an Parteien im Spektrum von SPD bis NSDAP (wobei die bürgerlichen Parteien bevorzugt wurden). Sechsstellige Wahlkampfspenden erhielten Kurt von Schleicher (parteiloser Reichswehrminister ab 1. Juni 1932), Alfred Hugenberg (Medienunternehmer; DNVP) und Heinrich Brüning (Zentrumspartei, Reichskanzler bis 30. Mai 1932). Die Regierungsmitglieder des Kabinetts Brüning II erhielten zusammen 450.000 Reichsmark an Spenden für den Reichspräsidentenwahlkampf 1932 und ihren Kandidaten Paul von Hindenburg. Ebenfalls 1932 wurde Flicks Privatsekretär Otto Steinbrinck Mitglied im Keppler-Kreis. Nationalsozialismus Der Erwerb der Essener Steinkohlenwerke bot nicht nur die Ausgangsbasis für den Einstieg in die Herstellung von synthetischem Benzin, sondern war für die Verhüttung von Erzen als Selbstversorgung der eigenen Stahl- und Eisenwerke von strategischer Bedeutung. 1933 kauften die Mitteldeutschen Stahlwerke die Allgemeine Transportanlagen-Gesellschaft (ATG), die nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg aus den Deutschen Flugzeug-Werken hervorgegangen war. Damit war Flick für das aufkommende Rüstungsgeschäft mit den Nationalsozialisten positioniert. Flick war Mitglied des konservativen Deutschen Herrenklubs. 1934 wurden die Mitteldeutschen Stahlwerke Pflichtmitglied in der „Pflichtgemeinschaft in der Braunkohlenwirtschaft“ und damit Gründungsunternehmen der BRABAG. Nach 1933 konzentrierte er die Spenden, rund 100.000 Reichsmark im Jahr, auf die NSDAP. Nach Ablauf der vierjährigen Eintrittssperre trat er 1937 der NSDAP bei. 1934 oder 1935 wurde er Mitglied des etwa 40 Personen umfassenden Freundeskreises Reichsführer SS. Am 20. Februar 1933 wurde er zusammen mit Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, Georg von Schnitzler, Fritz Springorum, Ernst Tengelmann, Albert Vögler und anderen Vertretern der deutschen Wirtschaft zum neuen Reichskanzler Adolf Hitler eingeladen. (Geheimtreffen vom 20. Februar 1933) Dieser wollte den Anwesenden seine Wirtschaftspolitik erläutern und gleichzeitig Bedenken gegen ihn aus dem Weg räumen. So war er sehr darum bemüht, das Image des Bierzelt-Agitators abzulegen und versicherte den Wirtschaftsvertretern, entgegen nur propagandistisch gemeinten Enteignungsankündigungen würden die Eigentumsverhältnisse in der Wirtschaft bei einer Machtübernahme unangetastet bleiben. Zudem sicherte er zu, den Einfluss der Arbeiterbewegung zu beseitigen und umfangreiche Rüstungsmaßnahmen einzuleiten. Nachdem den Nationalsozialisten und ihren Verbündeten durch das Ermächtigungsgesetz im März 1933 die Macht übertragen worden war („Kabinett Hitler“ aus NSDAP, DNVP und Stahlhelm), schickte Flick im April des Jahres 1933 den Aufsichtsratsvorsitzenden der Mitteldeutschen Stahlwerke, Heinrich Koppenberg, in das Reichsluftfahrtministerium. Dort wurden ihm größere Aufträge in Aussicht gestellt. Im Dezember war der Aufbau der Luftwaffe beschlossene Sache, und die dem Konzern gehörende ATG erhielt die ersten Aufträge für den Bau von Flugzeugen. Es folgte im März 1934 ein Auftrag für die Herstellung von Bomben, Granaten und Munition. Am 15. März desselben Jahres besuchte Friedrich Flick den Stabschef des Heereswaffenamtes, Georg Thomas. Im Januar 1934 erhielt Friedrich Flick den Aufsichtsratsposten der Harpener Bergbau AG. Nach Erwerb dieser AG war der Konzern in der Lage, Werke mit ausreichend eigener Kohle zu versorgen. 1934 wurde die Siegener Eisenindustrie AG in die Firmen Mittelstahl, Maxhütte und Harpener Bergbau AG überführt. 1937 wandelte er die Siegener Eisenindustrie AG in die Friedrich Flick KG um. Dies bedeutete, dass an der Spitze kein Vorstand einer AG, sondern eine Personengesellschaft stand, die zu 95 Prozent Eigentum der Familie Flick war. Teilhabe an der Enteignung jüdischer Unternehmen Bereits 1934 verfolgten das Preußische Innenministerium, Wilhelm Keppler und Heinrich Himmler das Ziel, das Waffenwerk Simson dem jüdischen Eigentümer zu nehmen, um es in „deutschblütige“ Hände zu überführen. Der Verhandlungsführer des Übernahmeinteressenten Flick, Otto Steinbrinck, war zu dieser Zeit nur an einer juristisch einwandfreien Überführung in das Eigentum Flicks interessiert, denn es gab damals keine gesetzliche Grundlage für Enteignungen. Deshalb wurde durch die Thüringer Gauleitung (unter Federführung von Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel) so lange politischer Druck auf den jüdischen Eigentümer Simson erzeugt, bis dieser einem Verkauf zustimmte. Die einer Enteignung gleichkommende Übernahme vollzog der Staat. Flick erreichte auf diesem Weg, dass er nicht als potentieller Käufer von Simson auftrat bzw. diesen zum Verkauf genötigt hatte. Ein weiteres Beispiel für die von der nationalsozialistischen Politik so genannten Arisierungen in diesem von Flick geprägten Stil war die Übernahme des Essener Bankhauses Hirschland 1938, wobei die Essener Gauleitung den Verkaufsdruck ausübte und die Essener Steinkohlenwerke Aktienanteile übernahmen, während Flick seinerseits den Steinkohlenwerken den erforderlichen Kredit zum Kaufabschluss gewährte, also wiederum nur indirekt mit den Geschehnissen in Verbindung gebracht werden konnte. Aufgrund dieser Anfangserfahrungen mit der Übernahme jüdischer Unternehmen in kleinerem Maßstab durch den Flick-Konzern arbeitete 1938 Hugo Dietrich, der Jurist des Flick-Konzerns, die Verordnung über das jüdische Vermögen vom 3. Dezember 1938 für die Nationalsozialisten aus, mit deren Hilfe die Enteignung im großen Stil und auf gesetzlicher Grundlage möglich wurde. Der Flick-Konzern forcierte anschließend skrupellos die Enteignung der Hochofenwerke Lübeck AG (s.u.) und der Fabriken der Petschek-Gruppe, um seine Interessen im Stahl- und Braunkohlesektor zu stärken und seine Besitztümer damit zu erweitern. Die guten Kontakte zu Hermann Göring trugen dazu bei, dass Flick stärker als mancher seiner Konkurrenten von der Enteignung der jüdischen Minderheit profitierte. Als einziger deutscher Industrieller unterstützte er die Pläne zum Aufbau der Reichswerke Hermann Göring in Salzgitter. Er lieferte im Gegensatz zu den Unternehmen von Rhein und Ruhr Steinkohle an die konkurrierenden Hermann-Göring-Werke. Dafür erhielt er die schriftliche Zusage, dass er bei „Arisierungen“ begünstigt werde. Flick war schon vor dem Dritten Reich an der Hochofenwerke Lübeck AG der jüdischen Familie Hahn und an der damit verbundenen Erzimportfirma Rawack & Grünfeld AG der jüdischen Familie Eisner interessiert gewesen. Beide Familien hielten 80 Prozent der Aktienanteile der Hochofenwerke Lübeck, die hochwertiges Roheisen herstellte. Bereits 1927 versuchte Flick durch zweifelhafte Aktiengeschäfte vergeblich eine Übernahme. 1937 erwirkte er zusammen mit dem Heereswaffenamt, dass die Firma für den Preis von 3,4 Millionen Reichsmark von ihm übernommen werden konnte. Drei Jahre zuvor hatte der Aktienwert noch 14,3 Millionen betragen. Weitere Beispiele umfangreicher Teilhabe an Großenteignungen sind die Übernahme des Julius-Petschek-Konzerns (1938) und des Ignaz-Petschek-Konzerns (1939) mit u. a. einem Drittel der mitteleuropäischen Braunkohlefelder. Besetzte Gebiete Im besetzten Polen wollte Flick die Bismarckhütte in Kattowitz, die sich früher in seinem Besitz befand, nach der Besetzung Polens als Treuhänder übernehmen. Dieses Werk schlug die Reichsregierung allerdings dem Krupp-Konzern zu. Nach langen Verhandlungen mit der Reichsregierung über die Aufteilung der Stahlunternehmen in der besetzten Ukraine, in denen vor allem die Hermann-Göring-Werke berücksichtigt wurden, konnte im Januar 1943 die Dnjepr-Stahl-GmbH neu gegründet werden, wobei die Flick KG und die Reichswerke Hermann Göring je zur Hälfte am Kapital beteiligt waren. Das Werk musste aufgrund der Kriegslage nach kurzer Zeit nach Oderberg in Oberschlesien verlagert werden. Ebenso wenig erfolgreich war die beabsichtigte Expansion im Baltikum in der Firma Vairog, die Eisenbahnwaggons und Lafetten produzieren sollte. Im besetzten Westen war der Flick-Konzern betriebswirtschaftlich erfolgreicher. Nach der Besetzung Frankreichs im Juni 1940 konzentrierte sich Flick auf die Rombacher Hütte, die Karl Raabe durch einen früheren Aufenthalt in Frankreich kannte, und wurde am 1. März 1941 als Treuhänder eingesetzt. Rombach brachte Flick einen bedeutenden Kapazitätszuwachs. Das Werk wurde am 31. August 1944 vor den Alliierten geräumt. Insgesamt konnte Flick seinen Firmenanteil nicht wesentlich in den eroberten Gebieten, bis auf Lothringen, mit Erfolg erweitern. Dennoch boten die Firmen in den besetzten Gebieten für Flick eine Basis für seine in Deutschland erweiterte Kapazitätsausweitung durch die erfolgten Firmenkäufe und -erweiterungen. Erstmals zog die Flick KG in der Stahlproduktion im Jahre 1941 mit seinem Konkurrenten Krupp gleich, dies war vor allem durch das Produktionsvolumen im Rombacher Hüttenwerk möglich geworden. Zwangsarbeit Im Verlauf des Krieges stieg der Anteil der Zwangsarbeiter stetig an. Innerhalb des Flick-Konzerns waren im Kriegsjahr etwa 1944 insgesamt zirka 130.000 Arbeitnehmer und davon waren etwa die Hälfte als Zwangsarbeiter und KZ-Häftlinge beschäftigt und wurden ausgebeutet. Nach Einbezug der Fluktuation unter den Zwangsarbeitern dürften 80.000 – 100.000 beschäftigt gewesen sein. Anfänglich bestand, wie bei anderen Unternehmungen, aus verschiedenen Gründen weniger Interesse an der Beschäftigung ausländischer Arbeitnehmer. Dies änderte sich im Verlauf des Krieges durch den entstehenden Arbeitskräftemangel ab Ende 1939/40. Der Anteil ausländischer Arbeiter stieg laufend an. Besonders in den Unternehmungen, die Rüstungsgüter herstellten oder im Kohleabbau tätig waren, war der Anteil der Zwangsarbeiter ab 1942 besonders hoch und bereits im November 1943 erreichte die Maxhütte der Flick KG einen Anteil von 44 Prozent. Während des Zweiten Weltkriegs wurden in den zahlreichen Betrieben Flicks zehntausende Zwangsarbeiter vor allem aus Osteuropa und Sklavenarbeiter aus Konzentrationslagern eingesetzt (darunter Ignatz Bubis). Schätzungen gehen von über 10.000 Opfern aus, die in diesen Jahren mit Unterernährung und brutaler Behandlung zu Tode geschunden wurden. Die Bedingungen hier waren äußerst schlecht und die Behandlungen sehr brutal. Selbst die Behörden wiesen auf diese besonders unmenschlichen Bedingungen hin. So schrieb eine staatliche Untersuchungskommission im Dezember 1942 nach einer Besichtigung der Essener Steinkohle AG: „Die Ostarbeiter sind gegenwärtig in Baracken für Kriegsgefangene mit schwerstem Stacheldraht und vergitterten Fenster untergebracht. Entwesung mangelhaft. Viel Ungeziefer. Strohmatratzen mussten entfernt werden, daher Schlafen nur auf Drahtmatratzen. Zuweilen Prügel. Lohnfrage ungeklärt. Essen nicht besonders.“ Seit 1938 war Flick Wehrwirtschaftsführer. Zudem gelangte er in einigen Großbetrieben der Kohle-, Eisen- und Stahlindustrie in die Aufsichtsräte und Verwaltungsvorstände. Er war Mitglied im vierköpfigen Verwaltungsrat der Berg- und Hüttenwerke Ost (BHO), einer staatlich-privaten Monopolgesellschaft, die in den besetzten Gebieten der Sowjetunion die systematische Ausschlachtung der Rohstoffvorkommen und die Aufnahme einer gewaltigen Kriegsproduktion mit erbeuteten Produktionsmitteln zu organisieren hatte. Friedrich Flick war einer der größten Profiteure des von den Nationalsozialisten eingeleiteten Rüstungsbooms und der anschließenden Kriegskonjunktur. Das Konzernvermögen erhöhte sich im Zeitraum von 1933 bis 1943 von 225 Millionen auf 953 Millionen Reichsmark. Die Flick KG wuchs im Laufe des Zweiten Weltkriegs auf 132 Gesellschaften mit einem Jahresumsatz von 550 Millionen Reichsmark an. Sein privates Vermögen wurde auf rund zwei bis drei Milliarden Reichsmark geschätzt. |
G;|Alexander Wassiljewitsch Suworow-Rymnikski (russisch Александр Васильевич Суворов, wiss. Transliteration Aleksandr Vasil'evič Suvorov; * 13. Novemberjul./ 24. November 1730greg. in Moskau; †  6. Maijul./ 18. Mai 1800greg. in Sankt Petersburg) war ein berühmter russischer Generalissimus und gilt bis heute als einer der größten Strategen der Neuzeit.  Alexander Wassiljewitsch Suworow war der einzige Sohn von Wassili Iwanowitsch Suworow, der am Hof Peters I. dazu erzogen wurde, später die Aufgaben des Dienstadels loyal zu erfüllen. Als sein Vater im Jahr 1775 als General-en-Chef und Mitglied des Kriegskollegiums starb, hinterließ er Alexander 1.895 Bauern. Das zeigt einen gewissen Wohlstand, aber keinen Reichtum. Alexander Suworows Geburtsjahr wird in den Dokumenten zu seiner Person unterschiedlich angegeben, aber nach eigener Angabe wurde er am 13. November 1730jul. geboren. Am 5. November 1742 wurde Suworow in die Stammliste des Semjonowski-Garderegiments eingetragen. Bis zum aktiven Dienstantritt als Korporal am 12. Januar 1748 bestand seine Dienstpflicht darin, seine Schulbildung zu erweitern. Dienstort war Sankt Petersburg – bis 1749, als das Regiment nach Moskau verlegt wurde. Dort besuchte Suworow die Landkadettenakademie, deren Abschluss sowohl einen militärischen als auch einen zivilen Rang beinhaltete. Absolventen, die sich bisher nicht in der Militärlaufbahn befanden, bekamen damit zwei Dienstränge, die sowohl eine militärische als auch eine zivile Laufbahn ermöglichten. Im Jahr 1751 erfolgte seine Versetzung als Adjutant zu Generalmajor Nikita Fjodorowitsch Sokownin. Von März bis Oktober war er in Diplomatischer Mission unterwegs nach Dresden und Wien. Die erste Versetzung in ein anderes Regiment fand 1755 zum Ingermanländischen Infanterieregiment statt. Als nächste Aufgabe erhielt er 1756 die Inspektion der Proviantmagazine im Gouvernement Nowgorod übertragen und wurde dazu zum Oberproviantmeister im Range eines Hauptmanns berufen. Im selben Jahr wirkte er kurzzeitig als General-Auditor-Leutnant im Kriegskollegium, bis er am 15. Dezember zur Infanterie versetzt wurde. Siebenjähriger Krieg 1756–1763 Im Siebenjährigen Krieg nahm er 1759 in der Brigade des Generalmajors M. N. Wolkonski an der Einnahme von Crossen und der Schlacht bei Kunersdorf (Słubice) am 12. August 1759 teil. Im folgenden Jahr wurde er Oberkriegskommissar des Kasaner Infanterie-Regimentes und war am 9. Oktober 1760 an der Einnahme von Berlin beteiligt. Später im selben Jahr diente er bei den leichten Truppen des Generalmajors Gustav Berg. Während des Gefechts bei Stettin am 22. Oktober 1761 wurde er verwundet und nahm ebenfalls an der Belagerung von Kolberg als zeitweiliger Kommandeur der Twerer Dragoner teil. Am 11. September 1762 bekam Suworow das Kommando über das Astrachaner Infanterie-Regiment und versah mit diesem den Wachdienst in der Hauptstadt. Der siebzehnjährige Michail Kutusow diente zu dieser Zeit unter ihm. Bereits am 17. April 1763 übernahm er erstmals für längere Zeit das Kommando über ein Regiment, das Susdaler Infanterie-Regiment. Feldzug gegen die polnische Konföderation von Bar 1768–1772 Im polnischen Feldzug gegen die Konföderation von Bar marschierte er als Folge der Verlegung des Regimentes von November bis Dezember 1768 nach Smolensk, wenig später nach Orscha, dann nach Minsk. Am 26. Mai 1769 übernahm Suworow erstmals eine Brigade, die aus den Regimentern Smolensk, Susdal und Nischni Nowgorod gebildet wurde. In nur 12 Tagen legte er im Sommer 1769 mit dem Susdaler Regiment und zwei Eskadronen Husaren die 500 Kilometer bis Warschau zurück und nahm die Stadt ein. Am 23. September 1771 besiegte Suworow mit 822 russischen Soldaten 3.000 bis 4.000 polnische Konföderierte. Der Wawel, die Burg von Krakau, kapitulierte am 26. April 1772 vor Suworow. Schon Ende des Jahres war er wieder in St. Petersburg. Russisch-Türkischer Krieg 1768–1774 Vor seiner Versetzung ins türkische Kriegsgebiet im Russisch-Türkischen Krieg inspizierte er Finnland. Auf dem linken Ufer der Donau bei Bukarest übernahm er am 17. April 1773 das Kommando über den Verband aus dem Astrachaner Infanterie-Regiment, ein Kavallerie-Regiment und ein Detachment Kosaken. Mit diesen Truppen war er Teil des rechten Flügels der 1. Armee des Generalleutnants I.P. Saltykow. Suworows zweiter Angriff am 28. Juni 1773 auf das türkische Lager bei Turtukai am anderen Donauufer war sein erster Sieg auf diesem Kriegsschauplatz. Das führte dazu, dass er das Kommando über den einzigen Brückenkopf der Russen auf dem türkischen Donauufer bei Hirsova übertragen bekam. Er schlug den türkischen Angriff am 14. September erfolgreich zurück. Der 27. Januar 1774 war der Tag, an dem Warwara Iwanowna Prosorowskaya, Tochter eines Generals a. D., die Frau Suworows wurde. Im April 1774 war Suworow bereits mit seinen Truppen auf dem Marsch zum Balkan. Dort schlug er mit nur 8.000 Russen bei Kosludsha ca. 40.000 Türken. Einsatz in der Ukraine und auf der Krim Am 30. August wurde er zur Armee P. I. Panins ins Wolgagebiet versetzt, in dem inzwischen der Pugatschow-Aufstand ausgebrochen war. Nach dem Ende des Aufstandes brachte Suworow den gefangenen Pugatschow nach Moskau. Im befriedeten Gebiet des Aufstandes erhielt Suworow das Kommando über die dort stationierten Truppen. Das Jahr 1775 brachte zwei private Ereignisse, den Tod des Vaters und die Geburt der Tochter Natalja am 11. August. Nach einem längeren Urlaub wurde er 1776 erst stellvertretender Kommandeur des Krimkorps und 1777 dann dessen Kommandeur. Mit der Übernahme des Kommandos über die Truppen des Kubangebietes im November 1777 nahm von Suworow sofort eine Umstrukturierung der Truppenverteilung vor. Im Jahr 1778 war es seine Aufgabe, die christliche Bevölkerung im Krimkhanat auf russisches Territorium umzusiedeln. Dafür erhielt er das Kommando über alle Truppen am Kuban und auf der Krim. Bereits im Sommer waren 31.098 Personen erfolgreich umgesiedelt. Suworow wurde 1779 zum Kommandeur der Neurussischen Division mit dem Stabsquartier in Poltawa ernannt, die die von der Türkei neu erworbenen Gebiete in der Ukraine schützen sollte. Aber bereits 1780 schien man ihn vergessen zu haben. Erst am 11. Januar 1782 erreichte er es, das Kommando über die Kasaner Division als neue Aufgabe zu bekommen. Es folgte 1784 das Kommando über die Wladimirer Division, die Geburt des Sohnes Arkadi und 1785 die Übernahme der Petersburger Division. Ende 1786 kommandierte er die Jekaterinoslawer Armee und 1787 die Division Krementschug. Russisch-Türkischer Krieg 1787–1791 Zu Beginn des Krieges standen unter Suworows Kommando rund 30.000 Soldaten der 1. Jekaterinoslawer Armee und der Truppen im Bereich der Dnepr-Mündung. Die Türken wählten als Angriffsziel die schwach ausgebaute Festung Kinburn. Trotz der wenigen Zeit, die zur Verstärkung der Festungswerke blieb, konnte der türkische Angriff am 11. Oktober 1787 zurückgeschlagen werden. Suworow wurde an der linken Hüfte und am Unterarm schwer verwundet. Nach der Genesung kommandierte er den Sturm auf die türkische Festung Otschakow am 7. August 1788. Die erneute schwere Verwundung, diesmal am Hals, verbannte ihn zur Genesung in die Festung Kinburn. Dort explodierte am 29. August das Pulvermagazin. Da er sich zu dieser Zeit nicht mehr in seinem Krankenzimmer aufhielt, überlebte er schwer verletzt. Allerdings zog er sich die Ungnade Potjomkins zu und wurde auf diesem Teil des Kriegsschauplatzes nicht mehr eingesetzt. Erst im Dezember 1788 wurde ihm wieder ein Kommando übertragen. In der Armee Rumjanzews kommandierte er die 3. Division auf dem rechten Flügel. Für den Sieg bei Focșani am 12. August 1789 schickte ihm Katharina II. den St.-Andreas-Orden mit Brillanten. Zwischen den Flüssen Rimna und Rimnik schlug er mit den österreichischen Verbündeten die Türken am 22. September 1789 in der Schlacht bei Martinesti (auch als „Schlacht am Rimnik“ bezeichnet). Die Zarin erhob ihn zum Grafen Suworow-Rymnikski, Kaiser Joseph II. erhob ihn zum Grafen des Heiligen Römischen Reiches. Potjomkin würdigte seine Leistungen und übertrug ihm am 6. Dezember 1790 das Kommando über alle Belagerungstruppen vor der Festung Ismail. Generalmajor Kutusow kommandierte dort die 5. Angriffskolonne. Am 22. Dezember fiel Ismail, und Suworow erwähnt in seinem Bericht ausdrücklich den Mut und das Können Kutusows. Wegen einer unziemlichen Antwort auf Potjomkins Frage, wie er Suworow für die Eroberung belohnen könne, fiel Suworow erneut bei Potjomkin in Ungnade. Der Sieg von Ismail wurde gänzlich Potjomkin zugeschrieben. Als Anerkennung wurde Suworow Ehrenoberst des Preobraschenski-Garde-Regimentes, eine Ehrung im wörtlichen Sinne. Den türkischen Krieg sah er nunmehr nur noch als Beobachter. Die Zarin kommandierte ihn am 5. April 1791 an die schwedische Grenze ab. Dort sollte er die Grenze inspizieren. Am 6. Juli 1791 wurde er Leiter des Festungsbaus in Karelien. Am 13. Dezember 1792 folgte die Versetzung in die Ukraine. Alle Truppen an der türkischen Grenze wurden ihm unterstellt. Er gründete Odessa, die Festung in Tiraspol und baute Sewastopol zu einer starken Festung aus. Kościuszko-Aufstand 1794 1794 wurde Suworow von Katharina nach Polen geschickt (Zitat: Ich schicke eine doppelte Macht nach Polen: die Armee und Suworow). Mit seinem Eintreffen in Polen nahm der Kościuszko-Aufstand ein schnelles Ende. Eigenmächtig beteiligte er sich an den Kampfhandlungen und siegte am 19. September 1794 bei Brest gegen die Polen unter Karol Sierakowski. Warschaus Vorstadt Stadtteil Praga eroberte er am 4. November 1794, worauf einen Tag später Warschau kapitulierte. Während der Einnahme Warschaus kamen im Stadtteil Praga ca. 20.000 Einwohner ums Leben. Nach der Schlacht bei Praga kam es zum Massaker der Zivilbevölkerung des Stadtteils. Dabei wurden mehr als zehntausend Einwohner getötet. Neben dem langersehnten Rang des Feldmarschalls, den er nunmehr 64-jährig erhielt, bekam er aus dem ehemaligen Besitz des letzten polnischen Königs Stanislaw II. August Poniatowski, der nach drei Jahren in russischer Haft plötzlich verstarb, die Herrschaft Kobrin und 700 dazugehörige Bauern. Er kommandierte nun alle russischen Truppen in Polen. Ende 1795 kehrte er nach St. Petersburg zurück, um nach dem folgenden Jahreswechsel das Kommando über die Neurussische Armee in Tultschin (Ismail) zu erhalten. Die Thronbesteigung Zar Pauls I. im Jahr 1796 hatte für die russische Armee unangenehme Konsequenzen. Zar Paul löste, orientiert an Preußen, das Stabswesen auf; außer dem Zaren durfte niemand im Offizierskorps Entscheidungen treffen. Suworows Bonus war bald aufgezehrt, und im Februar 1797 bekam er seine unehrenhafte Entlassung mitgeteilt. Im Jahr darauf wurde ihm sein Aufenthaltsort zugewiesen, und der Zar stellte ihn zusätzlich unter Aufsicht. Zweiter Koalitionskrieg 1799–1801 Oberitalien war 1799 auch Schauplatz des Zweiten Koalitionskrieges. Russische und österreichische Truppen vertrieben die französischen Truppen und zerstörten die französischen Satellitenstaaten. Für das vereinte russisch-österreichische Kontingent dieser zweiten Koalition wurde am 24. Februar 1799 Suworow als Oberbefehlshaber eingesetzt. Es folgten die Schlacht an der Adda am 27. April, der Einzug in Mailand am 30. April, der Fall von Turin am 22. Mai und am 18. Juni die Schlacht an der Trebbia. Die russische Vorhut kämpfte gegen die polnische Legion unter Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. Alte Gegner aus den polnischen Feldzügen standen sich erneut und unerbittlich gegenüber. Die siegreiche Schlacht bei Novi am 15. August 1799 beendete den Feldzug. Am 19. August wurde Suworow für seine Erfolge in Italien vom Zaren zum Fürst von Italien (Knjas Italijski) erhoben. Österreich und England wirkten auf den russischen Kaiser ein, die russischen Truppen aus Italien abzuziehen. Damit waren beide Staaten im politischen Vorteil bei den späteren Friedensverhandlungen mit Frankreich. Die Russen wurden in die Schweiz geschickt und marschierten am 7. September 1799 ab. Der Plan Suworows war es, mit seiner ca. 21'000 Mann zählenden Armee durch einen überraschenden Vorstoß quer durch die Alpen in den Rücken der Truppen von General André Masséna vorzustoßen und ihn zusammen mit den Truppen von Alexander Rimski-Korsakow und einer österreichischen Armee unter General Hotze bei Zürich in die Zange zu nehmen. Obwohl die Russen noch nie zuvor in den Bergen gekämpft hatten, eroberten sie am 24. September den Gotthardpass von den Franzosen, worauf sie unter französischem Beschuss die Schöllenenschlucht passierten. Angekommen in Altdorf, erkannte Suworow, dass ein Weg nach Schwyz entlang des Vierwaldstättersees, mit dem er gemäß der ihm von den Österreichern zur Verfügung gestellten Militärkarten gerechnet hatte, nicht möglich ist. Surowow entschied sich für ein waghalsiges Manöver über den Kinzigpass ins Muotatal. Obwohl seine Armee zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits sehr erschöpft war, gehorchte sie treu seinen Befehlen. Das Muotatal wurde am 27. September erreicht, wo Suworow die Nachricht von der Niederlage Rimski-Korsakows gegen Masséna erreichte. Auf einmal wurden er und seine Armee vom Jäger zum Gejagten und sie saßen obendrein noch in der Falle des Muotatals. Nach dem Sieg über Masséna in der Schlacht im Muotatal am 1. Oktober gelang Suworow jedoch der Ausbruch über den Pragelpass nach Glarus, von wo aus sich die russische Armee über den Panixerpass ins Bündnerland absetzte und dann über den St. Luzisteig Richtung Österreich marschierte. Trotz der extrem widrigen Bedingungen konnte Suworow ca. 15'000 Mann seiner Armee aus der Umzingelung herausführen und brachte noch ca. 1200 französische Gefangene mit sich. Insgesamt konnten die Ziele des Alpenfeldzugs jedoch nicht erreicht werden. Für die Verspätung Suworows spielte sowohl eine verspätete Bereitstellung der Lasttiere durch die Österreicher am Anfang des Feldzugs als auch irreführende Landschaftsdaten eine Rolle. Der vielversprechende Plan verwandelte sich dadurch in ein kräftezehrendes Abenteuer ohne militärischen oder politischen Nutzen, obwohl die Leistungen, die in seinem Verlauf von Suworows Armee erbracht wurden, Militärgeschichte geschrieben haben. Die ehemalige russische Italien-Armee war danach jedoch bis auf Weiteres nur bedingt einsatzfähig und Russland musste sich somit bei den Verhandlungen mit einer Nebenrolle begnügen. Am 5. Dezember erreichten die restlichen Soldaten Prag und bezogen das Winterquartier bei Dušníky. Suworows schwere Erkrankung ließ ihn den Oberbefehl abgeben. Am 20. März 1800 fiel er erneut in Ungnade, weil während des Feldzuges administrative Dienstvorschriften nicht eingehalten worden waren, die Existenz eines Stabes zur Kriegsführung war vom Kaiser bei Regierungsantritt abgeschafft worden. Offiziere sollten nicht am Schreibtisch sitzen, sondern kämpfen. Obwohl Paul I. Suworow vollständig freie Hand gewährt hatte und den Kriegsrat angewiesen hatte, dass Suworow keine Befehle, sondern nur noch Empfehlungen und Informationen bekommen solle, revanchierte sich der Monarch auf diese Weise, nachdem Suworow nicht mehr benötigt wurde. Am 18. Mai 1800 starb Alexander Suworow und wurde sechs Tage später im Alexander-Newski-Kloster beigesetzt. Die öffentliche Presse und der Hof nahmen weder Tod noch Beisetzung offiziell zur Kenntnis. Das einfache Volk versammelte sich in großer Zahl zur Beisetzung. Bereits ein Jahr später wurde Zar Paul I. ermordet. |
G;|Friedrich Daniel Bassermann (* 24. Februar 1811 in Mannheim, Großherzogtum Baden; † 29. Juli 1855 ebenda) war ein deutscher Unternehmer und liberaler Politiker. Er war einer der populärsten Abgeordneten in der Zweiten Kammer der Ständeversammlung des Großherzogtums Baden und maßgeblich an der Schaffung des ersten frei gewählten Parlaments für einen deutschen Nationalstaat, der Frankfurter Nationalversammlung, beteiligt. Als Vorsitzender des Verfassungsausschusses und Unterstaatssekretär im Innenministerium der Provisorischen Zentralgewalt trug er wesentlich zur Reichsverfassung bei. Als Verleger gründete er mit der Deutschen Zeitung eine der einflussreichsten Zeitungen im Vorfeld der Revolution von 1848/49.   Badische Zweite Kammer 1838 wurde Bassermann durch seine Wahl in den Kleinen Bürgerausschuss, dem er ab 1839 vorstand, kommunalpolitisch erstmals aktiv. Er gehörte wie auch David Hansemann in Aachen, Ludolf Camphausen in Köln oder August von der Heydt in Elberfeld zu denjenigen liberalen Politikern, die ihre politische Basis in den Kommunen hatten. In den größeren Städten hatten diese, von einigen Hansestädten abgesehen, die traditionellen Honoratioren weitgehend verdrängt. Bereits im Folgejahr gehörte er zum Hallgartenkreis um Johann Adam von Itzstein. 1841 wurde Bassermann als Abgeordneter für Mannheim Mitglied der Zweiten Kammer der Ständeversammlung in Baden. Dort zählte er „durch die rückhaltlose Offenheit seiner Reden“ schnell zu den profiliertesten Oppositionspolitikern und war mit weiteren bekannten Abgeordneten wie beispielsweise dem 1842 in die Zweite Kammer gewählten populären Mannheimer Advokaten Friedrich Hecker befreundet, mit dem er allerdings später in grundlegende politische Konflikte geraten sollte. Das von Bassermann in einer Rede in der Zweiten Kammer geäußerte Bonmot, „dass das Volk nicht für die Regierung da sei, sondern die Regierung für das Volk“, brachte es zu großer Bekanntheit im Deutschen Bund. In der Zweiten Kammer erlangte Bassermann neben seinem Einsatz für bürgerliche Freiheiten insbesondere als Fachmann für badische Zoll-, Finanz- und Verkehrspolitik, wo er sich vor allem für den Bau von Eisenbahnlinien im Großherzogtum einsetzte, Einfluss. Daneben arbeitete Bassermann auch an der ersten und zweiten Auflage des Staatslexikons von Karl von Rotteck und Carl Theodor Welcker mit. Bereits 1841 verkaufte er sein Geschäft aufgrund der politischen Karriere, die ihm keine Zeit für den Handel ließ, an seinen jüngeren Bruder Julius Bassermann und wurde Berufspolitiker. 1843 organisierte Bassermann im Rahmen des Urlaubsstreits, bei dem die badische Regierung Beamten, die für die Opposition in die Zweite Kammer gewählt wurden, den Urlaub und damit die Wahrnehmung ihres Mandates verweigern wollte, die Ablehnung des Regierungsbudgets und erzwang mit dem ersten parlamentarischen Misstrauensantrag der deutschen Geschichte den Rücktritt des konservativen Ministeriums unter Blittersdorf. Die nachgiebigere Linie der auf Blittersdorf folgenden Minister Boeckh, Nebenius und insbesondere Bekk ermöglichte die Rückkehr des Großherzogtums Baden zur fortschrittlichen Politik Winters und die weitere Profilierung Bassermanns als Oppositionspolitiker. Die deutsche Einheit als politisches Programm Im gleichen Jahr gründete Bassermann zusammen mit Karl Mathy in Heidelberg die später als Bassermann’sche Verlagsbuchhandlung firmierende Verlagsbuchhandlung. Deren bekannteste Publikation wurde die ab 1. Juli 1847 von Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Ludwig Häusser, Gustav Höfken, Karl Mathy und Karl Mittermaier herausgegebene liberal orientierte und für einen deutschen Nationalstaat argumentierende Deutsche Zeitung. Die Bedeutung der Deutschen Zeitung lag neben ihrem starken politischen Einfluss vor allem auch an ihrer Rolle als zentrales Netzwerk für Liberale aus verschiedenen deutschen Staaten, die als Korrespondenten, Berichterstatter, Aufsichtsräte und in anderen Funktionen für die Zeitung tätig wurden. Damit hatte die liberale Bewegung ein Organ zur Herausbildung gemeinsamer Positionen. Als Mitgründer, Verleger und wichtigster finanzieller Unterstützer der zwar als intellektuell und in ihrem Qualitätsanspruch führend geltenden, aber auch durch den bewusst auf den ganzen Deutschen Bund ausgerichteten Vertrieb wirtschaftlich stets Verlust tragenden Zeitung wurde Bassermann endgültig zum Sprachrohr der liberalen Bewegung in den Staaten des Deutschen Bundes und zu einem Vorkämpfer der deutschen Einigungsbewegung. Am 15. April 1844 forderte Bassermann in einer Rede vor der Zweiten Kammer in Anknüpfung an einen Antrag Welckers von 1831 erstmals die Einberufung eines gesamtdeutschen Parlaments, um einen deutschen Nationalstaat zu schaffen. Diese Forderung wurde zwar von der badischen Regierung unter Alexander von Dusch als außerhalb der Kompetenzen abgelehnt, traf jedoch in nahezu allen Staaten des Deutschen Bundes den Nerv der Zeit. In der Folge wurde Bassermann ein oft eingeladener Redner auf politischen Volksversammlungen und wurde als einer der populärsten Politiker Süddeutschlands gefeiert. Das politische Programm Bassermanns, der sich neben der Frage der deutschen Einheit insbesondere mit Themen der Wirtschafts-, Handels- und Finanzpolitik befasste, fand auch seinen Niederschlag in der Heppenheimer Tagung am 10. Oktober 1847, bei deren Organisation Bassermann zusammen mit Mathy, Itzstein und Hansemann eine wesentliche Rolle innehatte. Die von Mathy in der Deutschen Zeitung wiedergegebenen Tagungsergebnisse propagierten die – von Bassermann erst nach anfänglichem Widerstand unterstützte – Förderung und Erweiterung des Zollvereins zur Erreichung der staatlich-politischen Einheit Deutschlands sowie allgemein ein ökonomisches Programm, das die persönlichen Freiheitsrechte in den Vordergrund stellte und die Veränderungsprozesse der industriellen Revolution deutlich unterstützte. In der revolutionären Stimmung kurz vor Ausbruch der französischen Februarrevolution begründete Bassermann in der Sitzung vom 12. Februar 1848 in einer ausführlichen Rede in der badischen Zweiten Kammer seinen eine Woche zuvor gestellten Antrag „dass durch Vertretung der deutschen Ständekammern am Bundestage ein sicheres Mittel zur Erzielung gemeinsamer Gesetzgebung und einheitlicher Nationaleinrichtungen geschaffen werde“. Hierbei rechtfertigte er die Forderung nach indirekter Vertretung des Volkes beim Deutschen Bund mit der Sicherung politischer Freiheiten sowie der Stärkung des National- und Einheitsgefühls, da bezogen auf den Deutschen Bund eine „herrschende Abneigung der Nation gegen ihre oberste Behörde“ bestehe. Nur durch eine Verfassung sei das Vertrauen wiederherzustellen. Damit setzte Bassermann eines der entscheidenden Signale für die Auslösung der Märzrevolution in Deutschland. Die aus dieser Forderung entstehende Bewegung führte zur Heidelberger Versammlung am 5. März 1848, die wiederum das Vorparlament vom 31. März bis zum 5. April in der Frankfurter Paulskirche initiierte. Bassermann nahm an beiden Veranstaltungen teil und konnte dort zusammen mit anderen gemäßigten Liberalen darauf hinwirken, dass die Schaffung einer Verfassung in Absprache mit dem Deutschen Bund im Rahmen einer konstituierenden Nationalversammlung und nicht die Schaffung einer von Hecker und Struve geforderten Revolutionsregierung von der anwesenden Mehrheit als dringendste Aufgabe angesehen wurde. Anschließend war Bassermann als von der badischen Regierung bestellter Vertrauensmann Vizepräsident des Siebzehnerausschusses, der die Arbeit an einer neuen Reichsverfassung vorbereitete. Die Frankfurter Nationalversammlung Bei der darauf folgenden Wahl zur Frankfurter Nationalversammlung wurde Bassermann von den Wahlmännern mehrerer badischer Wahlkreise, aber auch vom friesischen Wahlkreis Kniphausen und dem vierten unterfränkischen Wahlkreis in Stadtprozelten, dessen Wahl er annahm, zum Abgeordneten gewählt. Ab dem ersten Sitzungstag, dem 18. Mai 1848, war Bassermann in Frankfurt, später ließ er seine Familie nachkommen und bezog mit dieser eine Wohnung in der Bleichstraße. Vom 9. August 1848 bis zum Ausscheiden Heinrich von Gagerns als Ministerpräsident am 10. Mai 1849 fungierte Bassermann als Unterstaatssekretär im Innenministerium der Provisorischen Zentralgewalt. Zwei Mal war er als Gesandter dieser behelfsmäßigen Exekutive in der preußischen Hauptstadt Berlin. Als Vorsitzender des in der fünften Sitzung am 24. Mai 1848 eingesetzten dreißigköpfigen Verfassungsausschusses der Nationalversammlung war Bassermann einer der zentralen Politiker in der Nationalversammlung und zusammen mit Gagern einer der Väter der Paulskirchenverfassung. Geleitet von realpolitischen Grundsätzen strebte er als führender Vertreter der Casino-Fraktion die kleindeutsche Einigung Deutschlands in einer konstitutionellen Monarchie unter preußischer Führung an: „Mein Glaubensbekenntnis war der Entwurf der 17er, von dessen erblichem Kaiser ich indes schon damals erklärte, dass mehr die Ereignisse als die Versammlung über ihn zu bestimmen haben würden.“ Die durch die Märzrevolution bedingte Veränderung der politischen Landschaft führte dazu, dass aus Bassermann, der in der badischen Zweiten Kammer, dem damals als am liberalsten geltenden Parlament im Deutschen Bund, die Rolle eines führenden Redners der Opposition innehatte, ein Mann der rechten Mitte wurde, der von der sich rasch herausbildenden radikaldemokratischen und frühsozialistischen Linken um Friedrich Hecker und Gustav Struve aus sozialpolitischen Gründen, insbesondere aber auch wegen mangelnder Radikalität angefeindet wurde. Umgekehrt betrachtete Bassermann es als eine seiner wichtigsten Aufgaben, dass die durch die Märzrevolution hervorgerufene Bewegung nicht in die von ihm befürchtete Anarchie umschlägt, sondern auf dem Weg des Parlamentarismus und der Verhandlung mit den bestehenden Regierungen des Deutschen Bundes blieb. Bereits im April 1848 hatte sich Bassermann in der badischen Zweiten Kammer gegen die politische Mobilisierung von Volksmassen und die leichtfertige Forderung nach einer Revolution mit radikalem Umsturz der politischen Verhältnisse gewandt: „Nichts ist gefährlicher als durch Übertreibungen in den Gemütern die Reaktion herbeizuführen; es kann dahin kommen, dass viele Bürger am Ende, im Unverstand allerdings, sagen: Lieber keine Freiheit, als keine Ordnung.“ Damit begab er sich in Widerspruch zur Linken, die eine radikalere Lösung forderte und durch entsprechende Agitation und mehrere Volkserhebungen wie beispielsweise beim badischen Heckeraufstand auch aktiv anstrebte. Diese Aktionen waren insbesondere beeinflusst von den durch die Missernten 1846 und 1847 hervorgerufenen Hungerunruhen sowie der wirtschaftlichen Situation der vom Aufbrechen traditioneller sozialer Strukturen betroffenen Tagelöhner, Handwerker und Kleinbauern. Hierbei bekämpfte die Linke nicht nur die Aristokratie und den Klerus, sondern alle, die sie für Profiteure der alten ständischen Ordnung sowie der neuen, durch die industrielle Revolution ausgelösten, wirtschaftlichen Veränderungen hielt, darunter auch die wohlhabenderen Kaufleute und Industriellen, die im Gegensatz zur Klientel der Radikaldemokraten von der neuen Ordnung direkt profitierten. Die Linke warf diesen Personengruppen vor, nicht an der Republik und an Gleichheit, sondern nur an der Verbesserung der ökonomischen Freiheit einiger Weniger, nämlich den wirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen für die Besitzenden, interessiert zu sein. Für die radikaldemokratische Linke war Bassermann somit ein „Pfeffersack“ und ein „Verräter des Volks“, Karl Marx bezeichnete ihn in der Neuen Rheinischen Zeitung als „Brutus Bassermann“. Kurz und prägnant erfuhr Julius Bassermann diese Haltung 1848 von Freischärlern mit den Worten „Was Bassermann heißt, gehört eine Kugel in den Kopf und ein Stich in den Leib“. Aufgrund der Rede Bassermanns am 18. November 1848 in der Frankfurter Nationalversammlung über die Zustände in Berlin: „Spät kam ich an, durchwanderte aber noch die Straßen und muß gestehen, daß mich die Bevölkerung, welche ich auf denselben, namentlich in der Nähe des Sitzungslokals der Stände, erblickte, erschreckte. Ich sah hier Gestalten die Straße bevölkern, die ich nicht schildern will.“ entstand das geflügelte Wort von den Bassermannschen Gestalten. Die Passage wurde insbesondere von den linken Gegnern Bassermanns verwendet, die diese Aussage als bourgeoise Haltung zu den Problemen der Armut ansahen und damit beweisen wollten, dass Bassermann die hinter der revolutionären Bewegung stehenden materiellen Probleme des Großteils der Bevölkerung nicht sehen wolle. Umgekehrt wurden die Bassermannschen Gestalten von der konservativ-reaktionären Seite gegen die Politik der Casino-Fraktion ins Feld geführt, da der darin bezeichnete Pöbel nicht in der Lage sei, als Souverän eines Nationalstaats zu agieren. Die Arbeit des von Bassermann geleiteten Verfassungsausschusses erreichte am 28. Dezember 1848 einen ersten Meilenstein, als im Reichsgesetzblatt das Reichsgesetz betreffend die Grundrechte des deutschen Volkes vom 27. Dezember 1848 verkündet wurde, welches dem deutschen Volk umfangreiche Grundrechte mit sofortiger Wirkung zuerkannte. Bassermann war klar, dass vor dem Hintergrund der beginnenden Gegenrevolution vor allem in Preußen und Österreich das Verfassungswerk in Gefahr war und drängte in der Nationalversammlung auf eine Beschleunigung der Verhandlungen. „Ich fürchte, der Particularismus in Deutschland schreitet schneller vorwärts, als unser Verfassungswerk“. Nach langen und kontroversen Verhandlungen, insbesondere um die zukünftige Staatsform, verabschiedete die Nationalversammlung am 28. März 1849 eine vollständige Reichsverfassung auf der Grundlage einer Konstitutionellen Monarchie. Diese sah ein erbliches Staatsoberhaupt vor, das nach der zu jener Zeit gegebenen politischen Situation nur der preußische König Friedrich Wilhelm IV. sein konnte. Damit war die kleindeutsche Lösung ohne den deutschsprachigen Teil des Vielvölkerstaates und Kaiserreichs Österreich gültiger Beschluss. Bassermann selbst hatte in seiner ersten Mission als Reichskommissar vom 7. bis zum 17. November 1848 in Berlin mit der preußischen Regierung und Friedrich Wilhelm IV. über diese Lösung verhandelt und dabei insbesondere auf die für die gesellschaftliche Ordnung bestehende Gefahr von der radikalen Linken hingewiesen, die drohe, wenn die Staaten des Deutschen Bundes sich nicht an einen konstitutionellen Nationalstaat bänden. Am 3. April 1849 war Bassermann Teil der aus 32 Personen bestehenden Kaiserdeputation, die Friedrich Wilhelm in Berlin die deutsche Kaiserkrone anbot. Das Lebenswerk Bassermanns brach zusammen, als Friedrich Wilhelm die Krone ablehnte und damit die Arbeit der Nationalversammlung zunichtemachte. Der preußische König glaubte sich seit der Niederschlagung des Oktoberaufstands in Wien und nach der Spaltung der Opposition in Radikaldemokraten und gemäßigte Liberale stark genug, jegliche Verständigung mit der Nationalversammlung ablehnen zu können. Die daraufhin mit der letztlich aussichtslosen Reichsverfassungskampagne folgende Eskalation der Märzrevolution, die durch die republikanisch und teilweise sozialistisch motivierten Maiaufstände, beispielsweise im Rahmen der Badischen Revolution, dem Dresdner Maiaufstand, dem Pfälzer Aufstand und bei Unruhen in der preußischen Rheinprovinz noch einmal bürgerkriegsähnliche Ausmaße annahm, bestätigte nicht nur die preußische Strategie. Sie führte auch endgültig zur Desavouierung der gemäßigten Liberalen, die nun sowohl von links als Verräter an der Revolution, als auch von rechts als Mitschuldige am republikanischen Chaos angefeindet wurden. Angesichts der preußischen Politik merkte Marx höhnisch an, dass „Bassermann, der Spökenkieker, selbst zu einer ‚Bassermannschen Gestalt‘“ geworden sei. So war auch Bassermanns zweitem Aufenthalt als Reichskommissar in Berlin vom 26. April bis zum 10. Mai 1849, bei dem er den preußischen König auch über den Willen der sich radikalisierenden und langsam auflösenden Nationalversammlung hinweg durch umfangreiche Konzessionen und Verfassungsänderungen zur Annahme der Kaiserwürde bewegen wollte, kein Erfolg beschieden. Am 21. Mai 1849, neun Tage vor dem Ende der Nationalversammlung in Frankfurt, legte Bassermann, wie viele Liberale in den Tagen vorher und nachher, sein Abgeordnetenmandat nieder, da nach seiner Meinung „die Beschlüsse der Nationalversammlung seit dem 4. Mai nicht mehr eine Einigung Deutschlands, sondern den Bürgerkrieg [fördern]“. Viele Liberale zogen sich angesichts der ausufernden Gewalt aus der Politik zurück und warteten die Niederlage der Radikaldemokraten, die endgültig mit dem Fall der Bundesfestung Rastatt am 23. Juli 1849 in Baden erfolgte, und die darauf folgende Phase der konservativen Reaktion ab. |
G;|Ludwig I. (genannt Ludwig der Fromme, französisch Louis le Pieux; * Juni/August 778 in Chasseneuil bei Poitiers; † 20. Juni 840 in Ingelheim am Rhein), war König des Fränkischen Reiches (in Aquitanien seit 781, im Gesamtreich seit 814) und Kaiser (813–840). Er war Sohn und Nachfolger Karls des Großen und führte dessen Reformpolitik zunächst erfolgreich weiter. In Auseinandersetzungen mit seinen eigenen Söhnen zweimal vorübergehend abgesetzt (830, 833/34), gelang es Ludwig dem Frommen jedoch nicht, ein überlebensfähiges fränkisches Großreich zu schaffen – drei Jahre nach seinem Tod wurde das Frankenreich im Vertrag von Verdun (843) aufgeteilt.  Geburt und Namensgebung Während Karl der Große sich auf seinem Spanienfeldzug befand, gebar seine Frau Hildegard, die er in der Pfalz Chasseneuil bei Poitiers zurückgelassen hatte, im Juni/August 778 Zwillinge. Nach Karls Rückkehr wurden sie auf die Namen Ludwig und Lothar getauft. Die karolingischen Königsnamen Karl, Karlmann und Pippin waren bereits an Karls zuvor geborene Kinder vergeben, und so entschied man sich für den Rückgriff auf die Namen der beiden bedeutendsten merowingischen Könige Chlodwig I. und Chlothar I. Der kleine Lothar starb schon 779, aber Ludwig – der spätere Ludwig der Fromme – überlebte. Unterkönigtum in Aquitanien Am Ostersonntag, dem 15. April 781, wurde Ludwig durch Papst Hadrian I. in Rom zum Unterkönig von Aquitanien, sein älterer Bruder Pippin zum Unterkönig von Italien gesalbt. Trotz ihres geringen Alters von vier bzw. drei Jahren wurden die beiden Brüder zu ihrer weiteren Erziehung in die jeweiligen Unterkönigreiche geschickt. Bei seinem Aufbruch hat Ludwig seine 783 verstorbene Mutter Hildegard wohl zum letzten Mal gesehen. Um die Erziehung des Knaben kümmerten sich von nun an ein Hofmeister und weitere Helfer, die Karl seinem Sohn Ludwig mitgab. Mit der Errichtung des Unterkönigtums Aquitanien verfolgte Karl in erster Linie defensive Zwecke, so musste Ludwig beispielsweise 812/13 einen Aufstand der Basken niederschlagen. 801/803 gelang ihm mit Wilhelm von Aquitanien und dessen Sohn Berà die Eroberung des von den Mauren besetzten Barcelona. Die Kultivierung des Landes und der Ausbau der kirchlichen Struktur waren weitere wichtige Aufgaben Ludwigs in Aquitanien. Auf einer Synode im Jahr 813 ließ der König den Michaelstag anstelle eines Festes des germanischen Gottes Wotan festlegen. Der Erzengel Michael wurde so zum Schutzpatron des sich langsam bildenden Heiligen Römischen Reiches und später Deutschlands. Nachrücken in die Nachfolge Wenn es bei Karls Reichsteilungsplan (Divisio Regnorum) von 806 geblieben wäre, hätte Ludwig allenfalls eine spätere Erweiterung seines Unterkönigtums auf Septimanien, die Provence und Burgund erhoffen können. Jedoch verstarben Ludwigs ältere Brüder Pippin und Karl der Jüngere überraschend 810 bzw. 811. Ludwig blieb damit als einziger legitimer Sohn und Erbe übrig. Doch offenbar bestanden bei Karl und Teilen seines Hofes zunächst Vorbehalte gegenüber einer künftigen Alleinherrschaft Ludwigs. 812 wurde erst der Sohn des verstorbenen Pippin, Bernhard, zum Unterkönig in Italien bestellt. Schließlich wurde am 11. September 813 Ludwig der Fromme in Aachen während einer eigens einberufenen Reichsversammlung von seinem Vater zum Mitkaiser gekrönt. Ludwigs Biograph Thegan berichtet als einziger, dass Ludwig sich dabei selbst die Krone aufgesetzt habe, was allenfalls mit Gebrechlichkeit Karls zu erklären wäre. Die heutige Forschung schenkt jedoch den Reichsannalen mehr Glauben, denen zufolge Karl der Große persönlich seinem Sohn Ludwig die Krone aufs Haupt gesetzt hat. Die Krönung Ludwigs zum Mitkaiser entsprach oströmisch-byzantinischem Brauch. Nur durch die Aufnahme des römischen Rechtsinstituts „Mitkaisertum“ war es möglich, Ludwig den Kaisertitel zu übertragen, ohne ihn sogleich an der Herrschaft im Gesamtreich partizipieren zu lassen. So kehrte Ludwig nach dem Erhebungsakt nach Aquitanien zurück und nahm weiter seine Aufgaben als Unterkönig wahr. Nach dem Tod seines Vaters Karl am 28. Januar 814 zog er dann unverzüglich nach Aachen und trat die Herrschaft im Gesamtreich an. Da er bereits Kaiser war, erübrigte sich 814 ein weiterer Erhebungsakt, von welchem die Quellen auch nichts berichten. Zwar wurde Ludwig der Fromme 816 (wohl am 5. Oktober) in Reims von Papst Stephan IV. gesalbt und nochmals gekrönt, doch hatte dieser Akt keine konstitutive Bedeutung, sondern sollte die Sakralität von Ludwigs Herrschaft betonen. Anfangsjahre als Kaiser Ludwigs Herrschaftsübernahme verlief mühelos, aber nicht bruchlos. Ludwig brachte sein eigenes Personal aus Aquitanien mit und besetzte damit den Hofstaat größtenteils neu. Seine unverheirateten, aber nicht entsprechend lebenden Schwestern verwies er vom Hof. Seine illegitimen Halbbrüder Hugo, Drogo und Theoderich behielt er zunächst in seiner unmittelbaren Umgebung, zwang sie aber nach Rebellion seines Neffen Bernhard von Italien 818 in den Dienst der Kirche: Drogo wurde 823 Bischof von Metz, Hugo 822/23 Abt von Saint-Quentin und der offenbar früh verstorbene Theoderich wurde vielleicht Abt von Moyenmoutier, doch ist dies nicht sicher. Die ersten Jahre der Herrschaft Ludwigs des Frommen waren, ganz in der Tradition seines Vaters, von einem großen Reformwillen geprägt: Zahlreiche Kapitularien wurden herausgegeben, missi dominici (Königsboten) legten teilweise erschreckende Missstände im Reich offen (Amtsmissbrauch, Rechtsbeugung usw., was Ludwig dann abstellte) und auf verschiedenen Synoden wurde das Kirchenrecht reformiert. So wurden beispielsweise im Jahr 816 durch den Beschluss einer großen Aachener Reichssynode die benediktinischen Regeln für alle im Frankenreich lebenden Mönche verbindlich, ebenso wurde mit der Institutio canonicorum Aquisgranensis („Aachener Kanoniker-Vorschrift“) für den gesamten nichtmonastischen Klerus eine einzige Norm in Liturgie und Lebensführung für verbindlich erklärt. Die monastische Reformbewegung führte auch zu Konflikten, in die Ludwig eingriff, so im Kloster Fulda, wo 817 auf die im Supplex Libellus vorgetragene Bitte des Konvents hin Abt Ratgar abgesetzt und der Konvent zur Durchführung der Reform für ein Jahr unter kommissarische Leitung zweier Mönche „aus dem Westen“, d. h. wohl aus dem Umkreis des Reformabtes Benedikts von Aniane, gestellt wurde. Eine weitere wesentliche Reform betraf das Prozessrecht: einige Formen des Gottesurteils wurden abgeschafft, dafür wurde der Zeugenbeweis eingeführt. Stark war der Einfluss kirchlicher Berater, wie des Abts Benedikt von Aniane, den Ludwig aus Aquitanien mitgebracht hatte und dem er in der Nähe Aachens das Kloster Inda (auch: Inden, die spätere Reichsabtei Kornelimünster) erbauen ließ, oder Markwards, des Abts von Prüm. Daneben ist insbesondere sein ehemaliger Milchbruder, Erzbischof Ebo von Reims, zu nennen, der allerdings später eine führende Rolle bei der Entmachtung Ludwigs 833 spielte. Der Reichsteilungsplan von 817 Vielleicht durch einen Unfall gedrängt, den der Kaiser wie durch ein Wunder fast unverletzt überlebte, regelte er schon 817, im dritten Jahr seiner Herrschaft, seine Nachfolge. In der Ordinatio imperii teilte er das Reich nicht – wie es fränkischem Brauch entsprochen hätte und wie es auch Karl der Große ähnlich in seiner Divisio Regnorum von 806 vorgesehen hatte – einfach unter seinen drei Söhnen auf, sondern fand eine Sonderregel für das Kaisertum. Lothar, der älteste Sohn aus der 794 geschlossenen ersten Ehe mit Irmingard, wurde durch Ludwig den Frommen in Aachen zum Mitkaiser gekrönt. Ihm stand die Nachfolge im Kaisertum zu, und er sollte eine Art „außenpolitische“ Hoheit über das Gesamtreich erhalten. Die nachgeborenen Söhne Pippin und Ludwig wurden ihm untergeordnet, konnten nur auf „innenpolitischer“ Ebene in ihren Teilreichen entscheiden. Pippin bekam Aquitanien und Ludwig den östlichen Teil des Fränkischen Reichs. Wegen dieses grundlegend neuen Konzeptes der Ordinatio imperii, bei dem das Abendland nahe daran war, sich bewusst als politische Einheit zu formen, nannte Theodor Schieffer das Jahr 817 „den absoluten Höhepunkt des karolingischen Zeitalters und der fränkischen Geschichte“. Der 812 eingesetzte König Bernhard von Italien, ein Neffe Ludwigs des Frommen, wehrte sich gegen die Bestimmungen der Ordinatio imperii, da er seine Herrschaft über Italien gefährdet sehen musste. Der Aufstand wurde niedergeschlagen, der zunächst durch die Fürsten zum Tode verurteilte Bernhard wurde von Ludwig zur Blendung begnadigt. Bernhard starb an den Folgen der Prozedur − dies bedeutete für Ludwig „eine fühlbare moralische Belastung“. Der Weg in die Krise: die 820er Jahre Benedikt von Aniane, Ludwigs wichtigster Berater, verstarb 821; die kirchliche Reformbewegung erlahmte seitdem. Ludwig der Fromme führte wegen seines harten Vorgehens gegen Familienangehörige, vor allem den verstorbenen Bernhard, auf dem Reichstag von Attigny 822 einen öffentlichen Bußakt aus. Damit erfüllte er einen Wunsch führender Geistlicher, die ihrerseits Pflichtvernachlässigung einräumten; trotzdem bedeutete seine Kirchenbuße einen Prestigeverlust. Blieb das Itinerar Ludwigs des Frommen bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt ganz auf Aachen konzentriert, war in den darauffolgenden Jahren eine stärkere Reisetätigkeit zu beobachten, z. B. zu den Pfalzen nach Frankfurt und Ingelheim. Ludwigs Sohn Lothar war von 825 bis 829 offiziell Mitregent. 826 hatte Ludwig den entmachteten Dänenkönig Harald Klak und dessen Gefolge anlässlich der Reichsversammlung in Ingelheim zu Gast. Dieser ließ sich in St. Alban bei Mainz taufen; Ansgar, Bischof von Bremen und Erzbischof von Hamburg, begann in der Folgezeit seine Missionstätigkeit in Skandinavien. Neue Probleme entstanden durch Ludwigs 819 geschlossene zweite Ehe mit Judith, der Tochter des schwäbischen Grafen Welf I. Vermutlich auf ihr Betreiben änderte Ludwig die von ihm selbst 817 aufgestellte Nachfolgeregelung, als er für Karl, den 823 geborenen Sohn aus seiner zweiten Ehe, mit Schwaben ein neues Teilreich schaffen wollte. Zugleich regte sich am Hof Unmut über den starken Einfluss Judiths auf den Kaiser. So schickte Ludwig 829 sicherlich auch auf ihr Drängen hin seinen erstgeborenen Sohn und Mitkaiser Lothar nach Italien und verwies Abt Wala von Corbie vom Hof. Die zweimalige Entmachtung 830/33 Als Ludwig der Fromme ausgerechnet während der Fastenzeit 830 zu einem nicht akut notwendigen Feldzug gegen die Bretonen aufrief, der von den innenpolitischen Schwierigkeiten ablenken sollte, kam es im April 830 zum offenen Aufstand. Mühlbacher, Th. Schieffer und Boshof deuten diesen als „loyale Revolution“ bzw. „loyale Palastrebellion“, d. h. führende Große am Hof des Königs stellen sich aus Loyalität gegen Ludwig – im Bewusstsein, ihn damit vor schlechten Ratgebern zu schützen und die Reichseinheit zu retten. Sein Sohn Lothar wurde aus Italien zurückgeholt und wieder zum Mitregenten gemacht, Ludwig der Fromme in leichter Haft gehalten, und die Kaiserin Judith, die des Ehebruchs mit Bernhard von Septimanien bezichtigt wurde, in ein Kloster bei Poitiers verbannt. Lothars Regime enttäuschte jedoch rasch, denn die „loyalen Rebellen“ schienen in erster Linie doch nur ihre eigenen Machtinteressen zu verfolgen. So kam es auf der Reichsversammlung von Nimwegen im Oktober 830 wieder zum Umschwung zugunsten Ludwigs. Ludwig der Fromme wurde wieder in seine Herrschaft eingesetzt, die Häupter der Verschwörung in der Folgezeit verhaftet oder verbannt, Judith nach Aachen zurückgeholt, Lothar dagegen 831 erneut nach Italien geschickt. Dessen aufständische Brüder Ludwig der Deutsche und Pippin konnten von ihrem Vater Ludwig dem Frommen 832 zur Unterwerfung gezwungen werden. Damit begann ein neuer Akt des Familiendramas, denn nun verbündeten sich alle drei Söhne Ludwigs aus erster Ehe, die eine Schmälerung ihrer Reichsteile zugunsten ihres Halbbruders Karls des Kahlen befürchteten. Wiederum zog Ludwig gegen seine Söhne zu Felde. Ende Juni 833 standen sich die Parteien auf dem Rotfeld bei Colmar gegenüber, bis durch Druck und Versprechungen alle Getreuen und Soldaten von Ludwig abgefallen waren und Ludwig am 30. Juni gezwungen war, sich zu ergeben und faktisch abzudanken. Das Colmarer Rotfeld wurde aufgrund der von Ludwigs Söhnen und Getreuen gebrochenen Eide bald nur noch als Lügenfeld bezeichnet. Ludwig wurde ins Kloster Saint-Médard bei (heute in) Soissons verbannt, wo er sich einer demütigenden öffentlichen Buße unterwerfen musste; dabei bekam er ein „Sündenregister“ überreicht, musste seine Waffen ablegen und ein Büßergewand anziehen. Die Kaiserin Judith wurde diesmal nach Tortona in Italien verbannt, ihr Sohn Karl der Kahle in strenge Haft ins Kloster Prüm überführt. Abermals kam es zu einem Umschwung, diesmal wohl maßgeblich ausgelöst durch die unwürdige Behandlung des alten Kaisers. Als Anfang 834 Ludwigs Söhne Pippin, von Westen kommend, und Ludwig der Deutsche, aus dem Osten kommend, gegen ihren Bruder Lothar vorrückten, fand dieser keine Unterstützung mehr und konnte sich nur noch nach Italien absetzen. Am 1. März 834 wurde Ludwig der Fromme in der Abteikirche von Saint-Denis feierlich mit Waffen und Krone geschmückt und wieder als Kaiser anerkannt. Lothars Macht wurde auf Italien beschränkt, die Kaiserin Judith aber von dort wieder nach Aachen zurückgeholt. Die letzten Jahre Ein neuer Reichsteilungsplan 837 zugunsten Karls des Kahlen, des Sohnes Ludwigs aus zweiter Ehe, der dessen Herrschaft über Friesland und das Gebiet zwischen Maas und Seine vorsah, führte zu neuen Unruhen, die erst durch den Vertrag von Verdun 843 mit der endgültigen Teilung des Frankenreiches beendet wurden. Dabei ebnete der plötzliche Tod von Ludwigs Sohn Pippin 838 den Weg zu einer einigermaßen ausgewogenen Dreiteilung des Reiches unter die drei verbleibenden Söhne Lothar, Ludwig den Deutschen und Karl den Kahlen. Bevor es dazu kommen sollte, hatte Ludwig der Fromme allerdings seinen Sohn Ludwig den Deutschen gegen sich aufgebracht, indem er ihm nur noch Bayern als Herrschaftsgebiet zugestehen wollte. Der Widerstand des Sohnes machte eine Strafexpedition notwendig, auf deren Rückkehr Ludwig der Fromme am 20. Juni 840 auf einer Rheininsel bei Ingelheim verstarb. Ursache war vermutlich ein Magen- oder Speiseröhrenkrebs in Verbindung mit einer Bronchitis. Nach dem Bericht seines Biographen Astronomus, Vita Hludowici, Kap. 64, lauteten Ludwigs letzte Worte „Huz, huz“, fränkisch für „Hinaus, hinaus!“. So sprach er mit zur Seite gewandtem Haupt, denn offenbar hatte er dort einen bösen Geist zu sehen geglaubt; dann blickte er heiter zum Himmel und verschied lächelnd. Ludwig hatte sich ursprünglich in dem von ihm gegründeten Kloster Inden, dem späteren Kornelimünster, bestatten lassen wollen. Im Westbau der heutigen Propsteipfarrkirche Kornelimünster gibt es noch heute die vorbereitete Grabstelle Ludwigs des Frommen. Jedoch veranlasste Ludwigs Halbbruder Drogo als Bischof von Metz, dass Ludwig der Fromme in der Abtei St. Arnulf in Metz beigesetzt wurde, wo auch seine Mutter Hildegard und andere Karolinger bestattet waren. Im 11. und 16. Jh. neu gestaltet, wurde Ludwigs Grabmal 1793 während der Französischen Revolution zerstört und seine Gebeine verstreut. Von Ludwigs wertvollem spätantiken Sarkophag, der den Zug des von den Ägyptern verfolgten Volkes Israel durch das Rote Meer darstellte, sind im Musée de la ville in Metz noch einige Fragmente erhalten. |
G;|Reinhard Gehlen (* 3. April 1902 in Erfurt; † 8. Juni 1979 in Berg am Starnberger See) war ein deutscher Offizier. Er war Generalmajor der Wehrmacht, als solcher Leiter der Abteilung Fremde Heere Ost (FHO) des Generalstabes des Heeres. In der Bundeswehr bekleidete er den Dienstgrad eines Generalleutnants der Reserve. Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg leitete er die Organisation Gehlen und war von 1956 bis 1968 Gründungspräsident des Bundesnachrichtendienstes (BND), der aus der Organisation Gehlen hervorging.  Herkunft Reinhard Gehlen wurde als Sohn einer bürgerlichen Familie in Erfurt geboren. Sein Vater Walther (1871–1943) war Major a. D. der Artillerie und ab 1908 Buchhändler in Breslau, wo Reinhard aufwachsen sollte. Walther Gehlen war zuletzt Direktor für den Ferdinand-Hirt-Verlag in Breslau, dessen Leitung er von seinem Bruder Max Gehlen übernommen hatte. Seine Mutter Katharina van Vaernewyk (1878–1922) stammte aus Flandern. Reinhard Gehlen war ein Cousin des einflussreichen Soziologen Arnold Gehlen. Militärischer Werdegang Reichswehr Beförderungen 1. Dezember 1923 Leutnant 1. Februar 1928 Oberleutnant 1. Mai 1934 Hauptmann Nach dem Besuch des humanistischen König-Wilhelm-Gymnasiums in Breslau und der Ablegung des Abiturs trat Gehlen am 20. April 1920 als Offizieranwärter in das 6. leichte Artillerieregiment in die Reichswehr in Schweidnitz ein. Im Oktober des gleichen Jahres wurde er in das Artillerie-Regiment 3 versetzt. Von September 1926 bis Oktober 1928 wurde er aufgrund seiner Fähigkeiten als Bereiter an die Kavallerieschule Hannover versetzt und schloss diese mit dem Dienstgrad eines Oberleutnants ab. Von November 1928 bis März 1929 wurde er in den Stab V. (reit.)/Artillerieregiment 3 versetzt. Von April 1929 bis September 1933 war er Bataillonsadjutant des 1./Artillerieregiment 3; im Oktober wurde er in das 14./Artillerieregiment 3 versetzt. Wehrmacht Allgemein Von Oktober 1933 bis Juli 1935 war er zur Verwendung beim Chef der Heeresleitung, General der Infanterie Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, und kommandiert zu den (geheimen) Generalstabslehrgängen. Im Mai 1935 wurde er zur Kriegsakademie kommandiert. Von Juli 1935 bis Juli 1936 war er Adjutant beim Oberquartiermeister I im Generalstab des Heeres im Reichskriegsministerium in Berlin. Im Juli 1936 erfolgte die Versetzung in die I. Abteilung und im Juli 1937 in die 10. Abteilung des Generalstabs des Heeres. Er unterstand zu dieser Zeit Generalmajor Erich von Manstein. Von November 1938 bis August 1939 war er Batteriechef (Feldhaubitzen) der 8./Artillerieregiment 18 in Liegnitz und nahm am Polenfeldzug teil. Im August 1939 wurde er Erster Generalstabsoffizier (Ia) der 213. Infanterie-Division. Von Oktober 1939 bis Mai 1940 war er als Gruppenleiter für die Landesbefestigungen im Generalstab des Heeres zuständig. Von Mai bis Juni 1940 war er Verbindungsoffizier des Oberkommandos des Heeres zur 16. Armee sowie zu den Panzergruppen Hoth und Guderian. Im Juni 1940 wurde er I. Adjutant von Generalstabschef Franz Halder. Von Oktober 1940 bis April 1942 war er Leiter der Gruppe Ost der Operationsabteilung, die von Oberst i. G. Adolf Heusinger (nachmaliger Generalinspekteur der Bundeswehr) geleitet wurde, des Generalstabes des Heeres. Gehlen war an den Vorbereitungen für das Unternehmen Barbarossa, den Überfall auf die Sowjetunion im Juni 1941, beteiligt; er war insbesondere für die Planungen Transport und Reserve-Nachführung zuständig. Mit dem Stocken des Russlandfeldzuges 1942 (Stalingrad) suchte der Generalstab nach einer neuen Führung für seinen Heeresnachrichtendienst, der in Konkurrenz zum Reichssicherheitshauptamt stand. Obwohl Gehlen sich nie mit Geheimdienstarbeit beschäftigt hatte, überdies keine Fremdsprache sprach und keine Kenntnisse über die Sowjetunion vorweisen konnte, wurde er im Mai 1942 zum Chef der „Abteilung Fremde Heere Ost“ ernannt und war somit auch Chef der Ostspionage. Anfangs war er auch noch für Skandinavien und Südeuropa zuständig. Abteilung Fremde Heere Ost Beförderungen 1. Juni 1938 Major i. G. 1. Juli 1941 Oberstleutnant i. G. 1. Juli 1942 Oberst i. G. 1. Dezember 1944 Generalmajor Zügig baute er seine Behörde, die ursprünglich Informationen des Leiters der Abwehr Admiral Wilhelm Canaris bewertete, um. Sie konnte, ohne andere Dienststellen einbeziehen zu müssen, Nachrichten integriert auswerten. Gehlen bekam Informationen auch durch drastische Massenbefragungen von Kriegsgefangenen nach der Devise des Oberkommandos des Heeres: „Jede Nachsicht und Menschlichkeit gegenüber den Kriegsgefangenen ist streng zu tadeln.“ Gehlen setzte Heinz Herre für die Auswertung, Gerhard Wessel für die Erkundung der Roten Armee und Hermann Baun für das Agentennetz im Feindgebiet vor der Front ein. Diese drei übernahm er 1946 nach dem Krieg in die Organisation Gehlen. Nach der Niederlage bei Stalingrad im Winter 1942/43 arbeitete Gehlen mit dem Auslandsnachrichtendienst der SS unter der Leitung von Walter Schellenberg zusammen. Beide wollten mit sowjetischen Kriegsgefangenen, Überläufern und Antikommunisten 1943 in der Sowjetunion eine Truppe unter General Wlassow als Komitee zur Befreiung der Völker Russlands aufbauen. Otto Skorzeny sollte ebenfalls hinter der Front eine Widerstandsorganisation aufbauen. Gehlen schlug noch die „Aktion Werwolf“, einen Widerstand aus Erddepots, vor. Bis heute liegen nur einige wissenschaftlich fundierte Analysen über die Arbeit von Fremde Heere Ost vor. Ab Oktober 1944 plante Gehlen für die Zeit nach dem Krieg. Dafür entwickelte er eine Hypothese, die sich später als richtig erwies: „Die Westmächte werden sich gegen den Verbündeten Russland wenden. Dabei werden sie mich, meine Mitarbeiter und meine kopierten Dokumente im Kampf gegen eine kommunistische Expansion benötigen, weil sie selbst keine Agenten dort besitzen.“ Kriegsende und -gefangenschaft Anfang März 1945, rechtzeitig vor Kriegsende, ließ Gehlen die gesamten nachrichtendienstlichen Materialien von wenigen handverlesenen Mitarbeitern auf Mikrofilm vervielfältigen und, in wasserdichten Fässern verpackt, verteilt auf mehrere Bergwiesen, in den österreichischen Alpen vergraben. Vorher hatte Gehlen seine Familie von Liegnitz über Naumburg in den Bayerischen Wald geschickt, damit sie nicht sowjetischen Truppen in die Hände fiel. Mit seinen Mitarbeitern Wessel und Baun schloss er den „Pakt von Bad Elster“. Sie verabredeten eine geordnete Übergabe an die Amerikaner. Am 9. April 1945 hatte Hitler Gehlen entlassen; Gerhard Wessel wurde, wie später 1968 beim BND, sein Nachfolger. Schließlich verließ Gehlen am 28. April das Hauptquartier der Wehrmacht in Bad Reichenhall, versteckte sich auf der Elendsalm bei Miesbach und stellte sich zusammen mit sechs Offizieren in Fischhausen am Schliersee am 22. Mai 1945 amerikanischen Soldaten. Gehlen musste erreichen, dass er für seine Handlungen an der Ostfront nicht, wie zwischen den Alliierten verabredet, an die Sowjetunion ausgeliefert wurde. Deshalb versuchte er den ihn vernehmenden Amerikanern seine Bedeutung für die Nachkriegszeit zu verdeutlichen. Doch er stieß bei ihnen zunächst nur auf wenig Interesse. Über Wörgl und Salzburg gelangte er zur Vernehmung in die Villa Pagenstecher in Wiesbaden. Dort wurde er von General Sibert vernommen. Im Gespräch stellte sich heraus, dass beide sehr ähnliche Visionen über die Rolle der Amerikaner in der Zukunft hatten. Die von Gehlen versteckten Dokumentenkisten wurden ausgegraben und ins document center nach Höchst gebracht. Captain Boker sammelte wichtige Mitstreiter Gehlens ein und entzog sie einer Inhaftierung. Gehlen, der in Kriegsgefangenschaft der US Army Air Force war, wurde schließlich 1945 mit sechs ehemaligen Mitarbeitern und den Dokumenten durch das Kriegsministerium der Vereinigten Staaten in die USA nach Fort Hunt, Virginia bei Washington, D.C. geflogen. Die Alliierten nahmen wie im Fall Gehlen zunächst auch andere Experten in Gewahrsam, unter anderen den Raketenforscher Wernher von Braun und die Atomphysiker um Otto Hahn. Bundeswehr In der Bundeswehr bekleidete er zuletzt den Dienstgrad eines Generalleutnants der Reserve. Aufbau eines westdeutschen Geheimdienstes Organisation Gehlen Über den Ablauf und das Ergebnis der Vernehmung in den USA ist nichts Genaues bekannt. Etwa 3000 Dokumente des National Archives über Gehlen für die Zeit 1945 bis 1955 wurden 2000–2002 zugänglich. Eine historisch fundierte Auswertung fehlt bislang jedoch. Gehlen wurde im Juni 1946 von Fort Hunt nach Camp King bei Oberursel zurückgebracht. Im Juli 1946 wurde vom US-amerikanischen Heeresnachrichtendienst G-2 Section dann die zunächst von den USA finanzierte spätere Organisation Gehlen gegründet, deren Chef er zum Jahresende 1946 wurde. Arbeitsgrundlage war folgende mündliche Übereinkunft: Es wird eine deutsche nachrichtendienstliche Organisation unter Benutzung des vorhandenen Potenzials geschaffen, die nach Osten aufklärt bzw. die alte Arbeit im gleichen Sinn fortsetzt. Die Grundlage ist das gemeinsame Interesse an der Verteidigung gegen den Kommunismus. Die deutsche Organisation arbeitet nicht für oder unter den Amerikanern, sondern mit den Amerikanern zusammen. Die Organisation arbeitet unter ausschließlicher deutscher Führung, die ihre Aufgaben von amerikanischer Seite gestellt bekommt, solange in Deutschland noch keine deutsche Regierung besteht. Die Organisation wird von amerikanischer Seite finanziert … Dafür liefert sie alle Aufklärungsergebnisse an die Amerikaner. Sobald wieder eine souveräne deutsche Regierung besteht, obliegt dieser Regierung die Entscheidung darüber, ob die Arbeit fortgesetzt werden soll oder nicht … Sollte die Organisation einmal vor der Lage stehen, in der das amerikanische und deutsche Interesse voneinander abweichen, so steht es der Organisation frei, der Linie des deutschen Interesses zu folgen. Dieser Text erinnert in seiner Tendenz an die Himmeroder Denkschrift. An ihrer Erstellung 1950 waren auch die Gehlen-Mitarbeiter Adolf Heusinger, Hans Speidel und Hermann Foertsch beteiligt. Ab dem 6. Dezember 1947 (Codename Nikolaus) wurde die Organisation in der ehemaligen „Reichssiedlung Rudolf Heß“ in der Heilmannstraße in Pullach untergebracht, weil das Camp zu klein wurde und der Geheimhaltungszwang dort in dem von 1936 bis 1938 für die NS-Elite gebauten Dorf mit anfangs 20 Häusern hinter hohen Mauern besser zu gewährleisten war. Die Zentrale des BND befindet sich noch heute dort. Ab dem 1. Juli 1949 übernahm die antikommunistische CIA die Organisation Gehlen. Die Organisation Gehlen nahm eine Doppelfunktion für die CIA und die noch junge Bundesrepublik Deutschland wahr. Sie war ähnlich aufgebaut wie ihr Vorläufer Fremde Heere Ost: Leitung durch Gehlen, Gerhard Wessel für die Auswertung und Hermann Baun für ein Agentennetz verantwortlich. Sie setzten auch ihre bewährten Methoden ein: Kriegsgefangene, ehemalige Zwangsarbeiter und Flüchtlinge wurden in Auffanglagern systematisch ausgefragt. Reinhard Gehlen selbst verstand seine Organisation von Anfang an als eine Vorform eines irgendwann eigenständigen deutschen Nachrichtendienstes. Konrad Adenauer wurde von den Alliierten keine große Wahl bei der Berufung des eigenen Sicherheitsapparats gelassen. Daher war ihm klar, dass ein völlig unabhängiger westdeutscher Auslandsnachrichtendienst genauso undenkbar war wie eine unabhängige westdeutsche Armee. So akzeptierte er die Umwandlung der Organisation Gehlen, in der eine Reihe ehemaliger Offiziere der Wehrmacht, RSHA- und SS-Mitglieder als Personalreserve „geparkt“ waren. Gehlen verheimlichte ihre Identität, um sie vor dem Zugriff der Alliierten zu schützen und eine Entnazifizierung zu erschweren. Auf „Empfehlung“ der Briten berief Adenauer den ehemaligen General der Panzertruppe Gerhard Graf von Schwerin zu seinem „Berater in Sicherheitsfragen“. Dieser gründete eine Art Nachrichtendienst mit dem Tarnnamen „Zentrale für Heimatdienst“, die mit Joachim Oster und Friedrich Wilhelm Heinz als Prominente aus der ehemaligen Abwehr besetzt war. Im Gegensatz zu Gehlen unterhielt Heinz gute Kontakte zur französischen Besatzungsmacht. Gehlen konnte schließlich über Adenauers Staatssekretär Hans Globke erreichen, dass Heinz am 1. Oktober 1953 beurlaubt und kurz darauf entlassen wurde. Nach Beginn des Koreakrieges am 20. Juni 1950 nahm Gehlen verstärkt Kontakt zur Adenauer-Regierung und zur SPD-Opposition auf. Er schaltete sich über seine Mitarbeiter Heusinger, Speidel und Foertsch in die Planungen zur Wiederbewaffnung ein. Gehlen verstand es, in den ersten zehn Jahren nach Ende des Krieges durch die Anwerbung auch vieler Geheimdienstler mit zweifelhafter NS-Vergangenheit, wie Heinz Felfe, schnell einen professionellen Nachrichtendienst aufzubauen. Dieser war aber auch eben wegen dieser Belasteten von potentiellen Verrätern durchsetzt. Hunderte von Agenten, Funkcodes und Kommunikationswegen wurden verraten. Doch angesichts der zahlreichen „Maulwürfe“ im britischen Geheimdienst war dies keine Gehlen-spezifische Erscheinung. So verstand Gehlen es ebenso, seine Rivalen um Gerhard Graf von Schwerin in Bonn als Auslandsgeheimdienst auszumanövrieren, wie ihm die Beschränkung des Militärischen Abschirmdienstes auf die Spionageabwehr innerhalb der Bundeswehr und die Sicherheitsüberprüfung ihres Personals gelang. Auch mit Otto John, dem ersten Chef des Bundesamtes für Verfassungsschutz, kam es zu Auseinandersetzungen. Johns Übertritt nach Ost-Berlin 1954, dessen Umstände bis heute nicht vollständig geklärt sind, kommentierte Gehlen, der eine „Abneigung gegen Anti-Hitler-Emigranten“ (Der Spiegel) hegte, mit „Einmal Verräter, immer Verräter!“, indem er einen Zusammenhang mit Johns Beteiligung am Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus herstellte. Gehlen war nicht ungeschickt darin, sich aus allen politischen Lagern Zustimmung für seinen Nachrichtendienst zu beschaffen. Dabei spielte seine Neigung, sich mit der Aura des Undurchschaubaren, Rätselhaften und Geheimnisvollen zu umgeben, ebenso eine Rolle wie sein Zusammenspiel mit dem Nachrichtenmagazin Der Spiegel, zu dem er enge Kontakte unterhielt. Auch dies war nicht zuletzt dem Umstand zu verdanken, dass dort in den frühen 1950er Jahren ehemalige Offiziere der Wehrmacht arbeiteten. Gründung des Bundesnachrichtendienstes Bereits 1951 begann die Diskussion über die Einrichtung eines oder mehrerer Nachrichtendienste auf Bundesebene. Laut einem Bericht der Central Intelligence Agency wurde der Name Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) erstmals im August und September 1952 bei Gesprächen im Kanzleramt verwendet. An den geheimen Gründungsgesprächen, die im Büro des damaligen Ministerialrates Karl Gumbel stattfanden, nahmen neben Hans Globke und Reinhard Gehlen auch die Mitarbeiter Gehlens Hans von Lossow, Horst Wendland und Werner Repenning teil. Ein Ergebnis der Verhandlungen war, dass die Organisation ab dem 1. April 1953 ganz aus Bundesmitteln finanziert werden sollte. Am 1. April 1956 ging aus der mehrere tausend Mitarbeiter zählenden „Organisation Gehlen“ der BND hervor, dessen Präsident er bis 1968 war. Sein Deckname war „Dr. Schneider“. Mit dem technischen Wandel der Geheimdienstarbeit und unter dem Vorbild der Besatzungsmacht USA verlagerte sich die Informationsbeschaffung zusehends von menschlichen Zuträgern zu leistungsstarken technischen Mitteln. Mit der Gründung der Bundeswehr wechselten nicht wenige ehemalige Offiziere der Wehrmacht aus der „Personalreserve“ in die neue reguläre Armee. Damit schrumpfte die Bedeutung der alten Seilschaften aus den Tagen der „Fremde Heere Ost“, und zivile, besser ausgebildete Leute stießen zum BND. Schließlich wurde Gehlen selbst zu einem Relikt aus einer vergangenen Epoche. Mit seinem Buch Verschlußsache kanzelte er seinen Nachfolger Gerhard Wessel ab und vergiftete für längere Zeit die Geheimdienstdebatte. Reinhard Gehlen verhalf dem engsten Mitarbeiter von Adolf Eichmann, dem in Israel und Österreich steckbrieflich gesuchten Alois Brunner, zur Flucht nach Syrien und galt laut Informationen aus Otto Köhlers Buch Unheimliche Publizisten als enger Freund von Gerhard Frey, dem Gründer und Vorsitzenden der Deutschen Volksunion und Herausgeber der National-Zeitung. |
G;|Raymond Triboulet (* 3. Oktober 1906 im 1. Arrondissement, Paris; † 26. Mai 2006 in Sèvres, Département Hauts-de-Seine) war ein französischer Politiker der Rassemblement du peuple français (RPF) sowie der Union pour la Nouvelle République (UNR), der zwischen 1946 und 1959, 1962 bis 1963 sowie zuletzt zwischen 1967 und 1973 Mitglied der Nationalversammlung war. Er bekleidete zwischen Februar und Oktober 1955 sowie abermals von Januar 1959 bis November 1962 Minister für Veteranen und Kriegsopfer. Darüber hinaus war er zwischen November 1962 und Januar 1966 Beigeordneter Minister für Zusammenarbeit.  Studium, Landwirt und Journalist Triboulet, dessen Vater als Rechtsanwalt am Handelsgericht (Tribunal de commerce) in Paris tätig war, absolvierte seine schulische Ausbildung am Lycée Janson de Sailly und wurde nach dem Tod seines Vaters 1925 Halbwaise. Ein Studium der Fächer Rechtswissenschaften und Literaturwissenschaften schloss er mit einem Lizenziat ab und ließ sich anschließend in der Normandie, wo er mit seinem Erbe einen Bauernhof erwarb. Daneben verfasste er Artikel für in Paris erscheinende Zeitschriften und sowie als überzeugter Anhänger von Charles Maurras auch für Manifeste der Action française, eine rechtsextreme, nationalistische und monarchistische politische Gruppierung in Frankreich, die 1898 unter dem Eindruck der Dreyfus-Affäre entstanden ist. Nach einer Begegnung mit dem Henri Robert Ferdinand Marie Louis Philippe d’Orléans Ende 1934 trat er in Verbindung mit dem Vorsitzenden der Bauernvereinigung der Normandie, Jacques Le Roy Ladurie, der ihn wiederum mit Henri Dorgères bekanntmachte. Danach wurde er Chefredakteur von La Presse paysanne und verfasste nach dem Zusammentreffen mit Lucien Rebatet sowie Robert Brasillach auch Artikel für Le Temps, Candide und Je suis partout. Erfolglose Kandidatur für die Nationalversammlung und Zweiter Weltkrieg Bei den Wahlen zur Nationalversammlung kandidierte Triboulet 1936 im Wahlkreis Clermont des Département Oise, unterlag aber dem Kandidaten der radikalen Front commun. Die Krise nach dem Münchner Abkommen führte zu einem Angriff auf den Patriotismus und seinem Bruch mit Brasillach. Nach Beginn des sogenannten Sitzkrieges (Drôle de guerre) zwischen dem Deutschen Reich und Frankreich zu Beginn des Zweiten Weltkrieges wurde er 1939 als Leutnant in den aktiven Militärdienst einberufen und geriet nach dem Beginn des Westfeldzuges zur Eroberung Frankreichs durch die deutsche Wehrmacht am 18. Juni 1940 in Kriegsgefangenschaft, aus der am 13. März 1941 entlassen wurde. Das ihm gemachte Angebot, die für die Landwirtschaft zuständige Presseabteilung des Vichy-Regimes zu leiten lehnte er ab und kehrte in die Normandie zurück, wo er ein Netzwerk der Widerstandsbewegung aufbaute, das Verbindungen zur Réseau Alliance sowie zu Ceux de la Résistance hatte. Im Mai 1944 wurde er Sekretär des Französischen Komitees für die Nationale Befreiung in der Normandie und führte in dieser Funktion am 7. Juni 1944 zusammen mit Maurice Schumann Gespräche im Hauptquartier der British Army. Wenige Tage später wurde er am 16. Juni 1944 vom Kommissar der Republik François Coulet zum Unterpräfekten (Sous-préfet) der befreiten Gemeinden im Arrondissement Bayeux ernannt. Als Gründer und Vorsitzender des Komitees zur Erinnerung an den D-Day empfing er am 10. Juni 1945 sowie am 16. Juni 1946 jeweils General Charles de Gaulle in Bayeux und wird durch die dort geführten Gespräche zu einem Anhänger des Gaullismus. Wegen seiner ablehnenden Haltung bei den Beratungen zur neuen Verfassung wurde er allerdings am 8. Mai 1946 als Unterpräfekt des Arrondissement Bayeux entlassen und übernahm nach seiner Ernennung durch General Marie-Pierre Kœnig die Funktion als Generalinspekteur in der Militärverwaltung der französischen Besatzungszone in Deutschland. Vierte Republik Wahl zum Mitglied der Nationalversammlung 1946 Nach der Gründung der Vierten Französischen Republik am 21. Oktober 1946 kandidierte er bei den ersten Wahlen am 10. November 1946 für ein Mandat in der Nationalversammlung und wurde im Département Calvados als Zweitplatzierter nach Joseph Laniel für die Liste Républicains indépendants zum Abgeordneten gewählt. Er wurde dabei mit 51.231 Stimmen (28,7 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen) gewählt und schloss sich nach seinem Einzug in das Palais Bourbon der Fraktion der Républicains indépendants an, deren Sekretär er bald darauf wurde. Ferner war er während dieser ersten Legislaturperiode zwischen 1946 und 1949 Mitglied des Ausschusses für Treibstoffe (Commission du ravitaillement) sowie zugleich von 1946 bis 1951 Mitglied des Ausschusses für Wiederaufbau und Kriegsschäden (Commission de la reconstruction et des dommages de guerre). Nach einem Treffen mit Winston Churchill am 14. Mai 1947 gehörte er mit Paul Rivet und René Coty zu den Mitgründern der Groupe fédéraliste européen, die sich nach Kontakten mit der von Coudenhove-Kalergi geführten Paneuropa-Union in der Europäischen Parlamentarier-Union engagierte.Darüber hinaus war er als Vorsitzender des Komitees zur Erinnerung an den D-Day auch maßgeblich an dem Gesetz vom 21. Mai 1947 beteiligt, das die jährliche Gedenkfeier zur Erinnerung an die Operation Overlord begründete. Im August 1947 war er Gründer der Rassemblement du peuple français (RPF) im Département Calvados und schloss sich anschließend auch der RPF-Fraktion in der Nationalversammlung an, die Teil der von René Capitant initiierten gaullistischen Gruppierung war. Zugleich wurde er am 30. November 1948 Titularrichter am Obersten Justizgericht (Haute Cour de justice), der zu zwei Dritteln aus Abgeordneten und einem Drittel aus anderen Personen bestand. Zum Ende dieser ersten Legislaturperiode gehörte er von 1950 bis 1951 dem Ausschuss für nationale Verteidigung (Commission de la défense nationale) als Mitglied an. Wiederwahl zum Abgeordneten 1951 und Minister 1955 Bei den Wahlen vom 17. Juni 1951 kandidierte Triboulet für die RPF, die insgesamt 118 Sitze in der Nationalversammlung gewann. Als Spitzenkandidat der RPF im Département Calvados empfing er während des Wahlkampfes General de Gaulle in Caen und stellte dort das von de Gaulle initiierte Programm für das nationale Wohl (Programme de salut national du général de Gaulle) vor, das im Wesentlichen der Bekämpfung der kommunistischen Parti communiste français (PCF) dienen sollte. Trotz der dortigen Kandidatur von sechs Wahllisten, wovon drei sogar ähnliche politische gaullistische Ziele verfolgten, wurde Triboulet mit 49.171 Stimmen wiedergewählt und lag damit sogar vor dem Ergebnis der RPF-Liste, die 43.986 Wählerstimmen (24,3 Prozent) erhielt. Nach seinem Wiedereinzug in das Palais Bourbon gehörte Triboulet zwischen 1951 und 1955 sowohl wieder dem Ausschuss für nationale Verteidigung als auch dem Ausschuss für Wiederaufbau und Kriegsschäden an. Im Februar 1952 gehörte er zu den Hauptrednern bei den Debatten zur Frage einer Europäischen Verteidigungsgemeinschaft (EVG). Am 14. März 1954 wurde er zudem Mitglied eines Unterausschusses für die Überwachung der Verteidigungsausgaben. Im August 1951 wurde er ferner stellvertretendes Mitglied der Parlamentarischen Versammlung des Europarates in Straßburg. Im Mai 1953 kam es zu Spannungen innerhalb der RPF-Fraktion, die dazu führte, dass ein Teil der Abgeordneten diese Fraktion verließ und unter dem Namen Action républicaine et sociale (ARS) eine neue Parlamentariergruppierung gründete, deren Vorsitzender Henry Bergasse wurde. Triboulet wurde zunächst Vize-Vorsitzender der RPF-Fraktion, die nur noch 78 Parlamentarier stellte, ehe er im Juni 1954 Fraktionsvorsitzender wurde, nachdem Jacques Chaban-Delmas Minister für öffentliche Arbeiten, Verkehr und Tourismus in der Regierung von Premierminister Pierre Mendès France geworden war. Zugleich war er von 1954 bis 1976 Mitglied des Generalrates des Département Calvados. Am 23. Februar 1955 wurde Triboulet von Premierminister Edgar Faure als Minister für Veteranen und Kriegsopfer (Ministre des anciens combattants et des victimes de guerre) in dessen zweites Kabinett berufen. Zu Beginn seiner Amtszeit bemühte er sich um die Schaffung ausreichender Haushaltsmittel und technische Unterstützung für die Aufgaben des Ministeriums. Im Herbst 1955 war er jedoch zunehmend verärgert über die Marokko-Politik des Premierministers und des Generalresidenten in Französisch-Marokko Gilbert Grandval sowie insbesondere wegen der ausbleibenden Reformen der Verfassung. Daraufhin traten er und Verteidigungsminister Marie-Pierre Kœnig am 6. Oktober 1955 von ihren Ministerämtern zurück und forderten zusammen den Républicains sociaux die Bildung einer Regierung des öffentlichen Heils. Sein Nachfolger als Minister für Veteranen und Kriegsopfern wurde daraufhin Vincent Badie, während Kœnig als Minister für nationale Verteidigung durch Pierre Billotte abgelöst wurde. Er hatte allerdings gegen die vorzeitige Auflösung der Nationalversammlung am 1. Dezember 1955 gestimmt. Wiederwahl 1956 Bei den daraufhin vorgesehenen Neuwahlen kandidierte Triboulet auf Bitten Faures im Département Calvados auf der Liste der Républicains sociaux, die aus Mouvement républicain populaire (MRP) und Centre national des indépendants et paysans (CNI) bestand. In seinem Wahlkampf vertrat er zum einen eine antikommunistische Haltung und unterstützte zum anderen die gaullistische Politik de Gaulles, der die Bedeutung Frankreichs als Weltmacht, aber auch in Afrika und Europa heraushob. Bei diesen Wahlen, die am 2. Januar 1956 stattfanden, wurde er mit 25.688 Stimmen wiedergewählt und lag damit erneut vor dem Ergebnis der Liste, auf die 19.621 Wählerstimmen (9,6 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen) entfielen. Während dieser dritten Legislaturperiode war er von 1956 bis 1957 abermals Mitglied des Ausschusses für nationale Verteidigung sowie zugleich Mitglied des Ausschusses für Justiz und Gesetzgebung (Commission de la justice et de la législation), ehe er anschließend von 1957 bis 1958 Mitglied des Ausschusses für Allgemeines Wahrrecht, Verfassungsrecht und Petitionen (Commission du suffrage universel, des lois constitutionnelles, du règlement et des pétitions) war und 1958 auch noch dem Ausschuss für Wiederaufbau, Kriegsschäden und Wohnungsbau (Commission de la reconstruction, des dommages de guerre et du logement) als Mitglied angehörte. Zum anderen war er zwischen dem 19. März und dem 3. Juli 1957 Vertreter Frankreichs in der Gemeinsamen Versammlung der Europäischen Gemeinschaft für Kohle und Stahl (EGKS). Am 22. Juli 1958 wurde Triboulet des Weiteren Mitglied des Beratenden Verfassungsausschusses (Comité consultatif constitutionnel), der sich mit der Ausarbeitung der Verfassung der Fünften Französischen Republik befasste, die am 4. Oktober 1958 ratifiziert wurde. Darüber hinaus war er am 21. Mai 1958 Berichterstatter bei einem Gesetzgebungsverfahren über das Mandat der in Algerien, Marokko, Tunesien, Kambodscha, Laos und Vietnam gewählten Mitglieder des Conseil de la République, der als damaliges Oberhaus des Parlaments dem heutigen Senat entspricht. Während dieser Zeit verringerte sich die Zahl der Mitglieder der Fraktion der Républicains sociaux auf 21 Abgeordnete. Fünfte Republik Minister in den Regierung Debré und Pompidou Bei den Wahlen zur ersten Nationalversammlung der am 5. Oktober 1958 gegründeten Fünften Französischen Republik am 30. November 1958 kandidierte Triboulet für die gaullistische Union pour la Nouvelle République (UNR) im vierten Wahlkreis des Département Calvados und wurde abermals zum Mitglied der Nationalversammlung gewählt. Am 8. Januar 1959 wurde er von Premierminister Michel Debré als Minister für Veteranen und Kriegsopfer in dessen Kabinett berufen und legte daraufhin am 8. Februar 1959 sein Mandat in der Nationalversammlung nieder. Er übte dieses Ministeramt bis zum Ende von Debrés Amtszeit aus und bekleidete das Ministeramt auch in der nachfolgenden ersten Regierung von Premierminister Georges Pompidou vom 16. April 1962 bis zum 28. November 1962. In dieser Funktion nahm er am Karfreitag, den 15. April 1960, an der offiziellen Einweihung des Mahnmals Bittermark teil. Anwesend waren ferner der französische Botschafter in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, François Seydoux de Clausonne, Paul Garban von der Suchstelle für französische Kriegsopfer und Delegationen aus vielen europäischen Ländern. Hauptredner der Gedenkfeier waren der Bundesminister für gesamtdeutsche Fragen, Ernst Lemmer, Minister Triboulet, der Dortmunder Oberbürgermeister Dietrich Keuning und Jean-Louis Forest, der Präsident der französischen nationalen Vereinigung der Arbeitsdeportierten. Nach der Bildung des zweiten Kabinetts Pompidou wurde Triboulet am 28. November 1962 Beigeordneter Minister für Zusammenarbeit (Ministre délégué chargé de la coopération) und übte dieses Amt bis zum Ende von Pompidous Amtszeit am 8. Januar 1966 aus. Zwischenzeitlich war er am 18. November 1962 zwar wieder als Kandidat der UNR-Union Démocratique du Travail (UDT) im vierten Wahlkreis des Département Calvados zum Mitglied der Nationalversammlung gewählt worden, legte aber auch dieses Mandat am 6. Januar 1963 wieder nieder, nachdem er Mitglied der Regierung wurde. Während dieser Amtszeit wurde ihm vorgeworfen, dass er als Minister seine Stellung genutzt hätte, seiner beim Abitur (Baccalauréat) Tochter Marie-Eudes Triboulet - wenngleich ohne Erfolg - zu helfen, in dem er beim Vorsitzenden des Prüfungsausschusses anrief. Bei den Wahlen vom 5. März 1967 wurde Triboulet abermals Mitglied der Nationalversammlung für den vierten Wahlkreis des Département Calvados, wobei er diesmal für die Union des Démocrates pour la Ve République (UDR) angetreten war. Zuletzt wurde er bei den wegen den Unruhen vom Mai 1968 vorgezogenen Neuwahlen am 23. Juni 1968 für die Union pour la défense de la République (UDR) zum Mitglied der Nationalversammlung gewählt und gehörte dieser bis zum Ende der vierten Legislaturperiode am 1. April 1973 an. Zugleich war er zwischen 1967 und 1973 auch Mitglied des Europäischen Parlaments. Dort befasste er sich unter anderem mit Fragen der Geschäftsordnung wie zum Beispiel der Sitzungsleitung durch den Alterspräsidenten des Europäischen Parlaments. Vorsitzender der Paneuropa-Union und Auszeichnungen Nach seinem Ausscheiden aus der Nationalversammlung wurde Triboulet 1973 Präsident der Paneuropa-Union in Frankreich und übte diese Funktion bis 1987 aus. 1974 übernahm er die Funktion als Herausgeber des Bulletin Résistance nouvelle. Er war darüber hinaus zwischen 1976 und 1980 Mitglied des Wirtschafts- und Sozialrates der Region Basse-Normandie. Am 17. Dezember 1979 wurde Triboulet Mitglied der Académie des sciences morales et politiques und wurde dort Nachfolger des am 1. Juni 1978 verstorbenen Wilfrid Baumgartner auf dem drittel Sessel (Fauteuil) der allgemeinen Abteilung. 1991 fungierte er als Präsident der Académie des sciences morales et politiques. Am 30. September 1999 wurde ihm vom Präsidenten des Senats Christian Poncelet die Große Medaille des Senats (La Grande Médaille du Sénat) verliehen. Nach seinem Tode folgte ihm 2007 Jean-David Levitte als Mitglied der Académie des sciences morales et politiques. Für seine langjährigen Verdienste wurde Triboulet mehrfach ausgezeichnet. Er wurde unter anderem Großoffizier der Ehrenlegion sowie Träger des Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 und der Médaille de la Résistance. Ferner wurde ihm das Große Verdienstkreuz mit Stern der Bundesrepublik Deutschland verliehen und er ist auch Großoffizier des Verdienstordens der Italienischen Republik. Des Weiteren wurde er Kommandeur des Order of the British Empire, des Belgischen Kronenordens sowie des Sankt-Olav-Ordens von Norwegen. Aus seiner 1928 geschlossenen Ehe mit Luce Chauveau, einer Enkelin des Naturwissenschaftlers Auguste Chauveau, gingen sechs Kinder hervor. |
X;Textsammanfattning eller textsummering (engelska Text summarisation) är namnet på de tekniker och metoder som används för att automatiskt eller halvautomatiskt producera en kort och läsbar beskrivning av innehållet i en lång text eller en samling texter. Textsammanfattning har varit ett språkteknologiskt forskningsområde redan sedan 1950-talet[1] Sammanfattning av texter har varit ett praktiskt problem som informationsvetenskaperna arbetat med länge, långt innan automatiserade tekniker har funnits att tillgå. Manuellt producerade sammanfattningar har studerats i flera omgångar i hopp om att där finna ledtrådar hur ett automatiskt system skulle kunna gå till väga - men det är tydligt att människor bearbetar text på ett sätt som inte är lätt att efterlikna med dagens system och att mänskliga sammanfattare inte är konsekventa i sitt arbete. Högkvalitativ och helautomatisk sammanfattning förutsätter verklig textförståelse och kan ännu inte åstadkommas. Det går dock ganska enkelt att använda ordförekomster tillsammans med ett lexikon som ledtrådar till att välja ut en delmängd av källtexternas meningar så att en sammanfattare kan använda dem som grund för sammanfattning. Forskningen gör framsteg varje gång en ny innehållsanalysteknik för text utvecklas: idag används i huvudsak statistiska och informationsteoretiska mått för att välja ut avsnitt ur källtexterna till en sammanfattning. De huvudsakliga utmaningarna för textsammanfattning är alltså att välja ut representativa avsnitt så att alla eller de flesta av de viktigare innehållselementen kommer med i sammanfattningen, att foga ihop dem igen till en text som är läslig (så att inte de urklippta delarna refererar till innehåll som inte tagits med i sammanfattningen) och att undvika att flera urklippta delar från olika texter refererar till samma sak så att sammanfattningen blir onödigt lång. Det går givetvis att ställa ytterligare krav på sammanfattningar, så att bibehåller samma tonläge och stilsort som originaltexterna och att innehållet inte motsäger sig själv om avsnitt valts ur texter med olika perspektiv på samma sak. Textreduktion är termen för ytterst kompakta sammanfattningar där en text sammanfattas med blott ett par ord. Textreduktion baseras på tekniker för nyckelordsurval och indexering, och tekniken är främst användbar där inte skärmstorlek eller andra fysiska begränsningar tillåter hela texter visas. Tekniker som informationsextraktion och namnigenkänning är besläktade med textsammanfattning och går att använda som delkomponenter i ett mer sofistikerat sammanfattningssystem.
X;|Rodrigo D¡azÿ(Vivar del Cid,ÿBurgos,ÿc.ÿ10483ÿ-Valencia,ÿ1099) fue unÿcaballeroÿcastellanoÿque lleg¢ a dominar al frente de su propiaÿmesnadaÿel Levante de laÿpen¡nsula ib‚ricaÿa finales delÿsiglo XIÿde forma aut¢noma respecto de la autoridad de rey alguno. Consigui¢ conquistarÿValenciaÿy estableci¢ en esta ciudad unÿse¤or¡o independienteÿdesde elÿ17 de junioÿdeÿ1094ÿhasta su muerte; su esposaÿJimena D¡azÿlo hered¢ y mantuvo hastaÿ1102, cuando pas¢ de nuevo a dominio musulm n. Pese a su leyenda posterior comoÿh‚roe nacionalÿ(y m s concretamente deÿCastilla) o cruzado en favor de laÿReconquista, a lo largo de su vida se puso a las ¢rdenes de diferentes caudillos, tanto cristianos como musulmanes, luchando realmente como su propio amo y por su propio beneficio, por lo que el retrato que de ‚l hacen algunos autores es similar al de unÿmercenario, un soldado profesional, que presta sus servicios a cambio de una paga. Se trata de una figura hist¢rica y legendaria de laÿReconquista, cuya vida inspir¢ el m s importanteÿcantar de gestaÿde laÿliteratura espa¤ola, elÿCantar de mio Cid.

X;Edvard Hagerup Griegÿ(f?dtÿ15. juniÿ1843ÿiÿBergen, d?dÿ4. septemberÿ1907ÿi Bergen) var en norskÿnasjonalromantiskÿkomponist. Han er den norske komponisten som har f†tt st?rst internasjonalt gjennomslag, og i likhet medÿBj?rnstjerne Bj?rnsonÿog andre kunstnere fra siste del av 1800-tallet fikk han stor betydning for den kulturelle nasjonsbyggingen i tiden fram mot unionsoppl?sningen i 1905. Griegs mest kjente verk er troligÿklaverkonserten i a-moll, op. 16. Andre kjente orkesterverk erÿPeer Gynt-suitene, opp. 46 og 55, samt suitenÿFra Holbergs tid, op. 40. St?rst betydning i samtiden hadde Grieg med sine 66 klaverminiatyrerÿLyriske stykker, mens det i dag erÿkammermusikkÿog sanger som regnes som mest verdifulle.[1]ÿSom sangkomponist er Grieg i Norge blitt mest kjent med sine tonesettinger til dikt avÿAasmund Olavsson VinjeÿogÿArne Garborg. I utlandet ble hans sanger til tekster avÿHenrik Ibsen,ÿH.C. AndersenÿogÿHeinrich Heineÿlagt mest merke til. 15 †r gammel begynte Grieg † studere vedÿkonservatoriet i Leipzig. Senere tilbrakte han noen grunnleggende ungdoms†r i K?benhavn. Her m?tte han tidens nasjonalromantiske str?mninger. Avgj?rende for utviklingen av hans personlige stil som komponist var et m?te medÿRikard Nordraak. Grieg begynte bevisst † ta utgangspunkt i trekk fra norsk vokal og instrumental folkemusikk og lot dem gjennomsyre etÿh?yromantiskÿtonespr†k.
